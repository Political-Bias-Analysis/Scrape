            "article_content": "Republican Sen. Jeff Flake of Arizona said he will not seek re-election in a speech lambasting President Trump. Also, a court has ruled in favor of an unauthorized immigrant's right to an abortion.  STEVE INSKEEP, HOST: The word debase - debase has been trending on Merriam-Webster's website. DAVID GREENE, HOST: So this word means to lower in status or character. And two Republican senators used it yesterday talking about what they see as the debasing of the country under President Trump. Here's some of what else they said. Senator Bob Corker gave an interview to CNN. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) BOB CORKER: The president has great difficulty with the truth. GREENE: And then there was Corker's colleague, Jeff Flake, giving this emotional speech on the floor of the Senate. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) JEFF FLAKE: Reckless, outrageous and undignified behavior has become excused and countenanced as telling it like it is when it is actually just reckless, outrageous and undignified. GREENE: And Senator Flake expanded on those thoughts in an interview with NPR. FLAKE: I think we know by, you know, nine months into the administration that the pivot that we all hope for is not coming. And before this becomes the new normal, I think we have to stand up and say this is not normal. And if we don't stand up now, I think we're going to lose that chance. GREENE: Now, it is not exactly news that Flake is critical of President Trump. He has been that way since well before the election. But here's the other part of this story. Even as Flake said it was time to stand up, he said he is retiring from the Senate. He's not going to seek re-election in 2018. So where does this leave the Republican Party? INSKEEP: Let's put that question to NPR's Ron Elving and NPR's Tamara Keith who cover Washington - both have for years. Hi, guys. TAMARA KEITH, BYLINE: Good morning. RON ELVING, BYLINE: Good morning, Steve. INSKEEP: Ron, you've seen a lot. Have you ever seen a speech quite like Flake's? ELVING: Can't say that I have or at least not in a long time. I think we'd have to go back to the very last year of the Watergate crisis - that would be 1973 - to find a time when Republicans were using terms of this kind to question the fundamental integrity of a member of their own party in the White House. INSKEEP: Fundamental integrity - are you telling me that this is about character rather than issues? ELVING: It is about character, Steve. It's not about policy. It's not about politics. It's not a dispute about money. We've heard Republicans have plenty of quarrels between themselves, among themselves, over those kinds of issues before. It's just the era of Trump has completely discombobulated what had always been the party of unity and the party that we expected to fall in line. INSKEEP: Discombobulated - always happy when we get that into our coverage here. Tam, what does Jeff Flake get out of retirement? Why not stay if he feels so strongly about the direction of the country and the president? KEITH: Well, two things - staying may not have been an option for him. His re-election chances - he was definitely in peril in terms of re-election. Here's the other thing - if you look at his colleague from Arizona, John McCain - Senator John McCain - he was always a maverick until about a year before re-election, and then he'd sort of calibrate. Well, now, Jeff Flake doesn't have to calibrate for re-election. He can say what he wants to say and do what he wants to do. INSKEEP: And we'll find out as legislation comes forward in the coming months how he uses that opportunity. But let me ask you about something else because Jeff Flake said he did not want to be complicit - did not want his colleagues to be complicit. So when we had our interview with him, we asked about two friends of Jeff Flake who are not going to retire. Let's listen to a little bit of that conversation. INSKEEP: Is your longtime friend and past collaborator Vice President Mike Pence part of the problem? FLAKE: Oh, I'm a good friend of Mike Pence, and I think the world of him. He's in a tough situation where he is. And I think if the buck stops with the president... INSKEEP: But I think you're talking about members of Congress who are enabling the president in effect. Isn't the vice president doing the same thing, if that's what it is? FLAKE: Well, I have to hope that in their private moments he's trying to prevail on the president to change his behavior as it relates to members of Congress or Gold Star families or others. INSKEEP: Is Speaker Ryan part of the problem? FLAKE: Paul is a good man with a tough job, and I think that, you know, certainly during the campaign on a number of occasions and a few times since, he's stood up. I think that we obviously need to do more. INSKEEP: Ron Elving, what do you hear there? ELVING: He has a tough answer to give on the Mike Pence question in particular, as all Republicans do. It is completely expected that the vice president will be utterly loyal no matter what his private thoughts may be. And certainly, Mike Pence has upheld that, most recently yesterday by coming out and casting yet another tie-breaking vote in the Senate to kill a rule that would've restrained Wall Street a little bit, a rule that came out of the 2008 mortgage crisis - something that would have protected the rights in court of people who had beefs with their financial institutions. He will have to be on the Trump line on every occasion. And Mike Pence, even as president, would probably look a lot like Donald Trump in terms of policy. INSKEEP: In terms of policy. ELVING: At least if not in terms of manner. INSKEEP: Well, that gets to the next thing because the president still does have an agenda. He wants tax reform to pass. What does all this mean, Tamara Keith, for the president's agenda? KEITH: I don't think that we necessarily know. I think that there are a lot of people on the Republican side who want tax changes, who are concerned about the feuding about the, you know, the flurry of tweets that came from the president against Bob Corker yesterday after Corker said some stuff on cable that the president apparently saw. But it's not clear whether, you know, Jeff Flake would ultimately be a no vote on any of these policy matters that the president and, frankly, people in his party want. INSKEEP: Well, what does all this mean for the future shape of the Republican Party that Jeff Flake would step down and Bob Corker also by the way stepping down? KEITH: I - you know, I think it's hard to know exactly, but I think that we are seeing the transformation of the Republican Party. This is becoming the party of Trump. This is not your grandmother's Republican Party where they want free trade, and they care about the deficit. Things are changing. INSKEEP: A reminder that we could be seeing the implosion of the Republican Party, but we could actually also be seeing simply a change in what the Republican Party is and what it stands for. And... KEITH: An evolution, not an implosion. INSKEEP: An evolution. There you go. NPR's Tamara Keith and NPR's Ron Elving, thanks to you both. KEITH: You're welcome. ELVING: Thank you. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) INSKEEP: OK. Let's hear about a legal case in Texas that involves two hot-button issues at once. GREENE: Yeah. It's really the intersection, Steve, of immigration and abortion. At the center of all of this is a 17-year-old. She is in this country illegally. She's in a detention facility. She is also pregnant, and she wants an abortion. A Trump administration rule prevented her from getting one, but now an appeals court has cleared the way for the teenager to go through with this procedure. INSKEEP: NPR's Sarah McCammon has been following this story. Good morning, Sarah. SARAH MCCAMMON, BYLINE: Good morning. INSKEEP: Remind us what is known about the young woman. MCCAMMON: Well, in court papers, she's known as Jane Doe. We're told she's about 15 weeks pregnant - at least as of late last week. She's been in the U.S. since early September according to her lawyers, and they say she came into the country from Central America without her parents. So because of that, she's an unaccompanied minor under the control of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. Now, she's being held in a private facility in Brownsville, Texas, that contracts with the federal government. What happened was late last month she requested and received permission from a state judge in Texas to get an abortion, and that's required under the state's parental consent law. But the federal government has been blocking her from leaving the facility where she's being held to get that abortion. INSKEEP: And is the Trump administration effectively saying we're standing in for your parents, and we say no? Is that their legal argument? MCCAMMON: Essentially right. They say that they're acting in her best interests, and they don't believe getting an abortion is in her best interest. They also have been making this argument that they don't want to, quote, \"facilitate the procedure.\" It should be noted, Steve, that the girl is not asking the federal government to pay for the abortion. That's prohibited in most cases under federal law. Her attorneys say it would be paid for privately, that volunteers would take her to the clinic, but the federal government has not wanted to approve her leaving to do this. In the court hearing I attended late last week in Washington, attorneys for the federal government said that their goal is to, quote, \"promote childbirth and protect fetal life.\" So there has been quite a legal tug of war, a lot of back and forth here. And at this point, a federal appeals court in D.C. has said the Trump administration cannot block this young woman from getting the abortion - stay with me here - that reversed a ruling from late last week where a three-judge panel had said the government should find her a sponsor. The idea there being someone who could take responsibility for her so the government wouldn't have to be involved in any way in an abortion. Now the full appeals court reversed that and said that's not so easy to do. INSKEEP: I need a little help here, Sarah McCammon, with some of the language that was used. You said the government said it was - its interest was not protecting the life of the unborn, which I would completely understand, that's been part of the political discussion for a long time, but to promote childbirth. Was the government saying that it had the right to do family planning for this young woman? MCCAMMON: The arguments I heard didn't weigh in on that. But basically the government attorney was making the argument that it's the government's responsibility to protect her. And they said fetal life, and they see her giving birth as the best outcome. And she strongly disagrees. INSKEEP: And is she now clear because the court ruling to do what she would like to do? MCCAMMON: It looks that way unless there's an appeal from the federal government. So we'll have to wait and see. INSKEEP: OK. Sarah, thanks very much for your work as always. MCCAMMON: Thank you. INSKEEP: That's NPR's Sarah McCammon on a court ruling at the end - possibly the end of a court case involving a 17-year-old who entered the United States illegally.

When Donald Trump was running for president, he often promised to bring big change to Washington, almost overnight. \"When we win on Nov. 8,\" he told supporters in Pennsylvania, a week before Election Day, \"we will be able to immediately repeal and replace Obamacare.\" A year later, that turned out to be more complicated than Trump expected. Change in Washington often comes slowly. Just ask former President Barack Obama. Despite his dire warnings during the campaign about what a Trump victory would mean, Obama told the New Yorker shortly after the election that he expected much of his legacy to survive. \"Maybe 15 percent of that gets rolled back,\" Obama told journalist David Remnick. In a post-election White House news conference, Obama also noted, \"The federal government and our democracy is not a speedboat. It's an ocean liner.\" Obamacare isn't the only piece of the last president's agenda that's proved to be hard for Trump to undo. Although he announced with considerable fanfare his intent to withdraw from the Paris climate agreement, that turns out to be a multiyear-long process. Even Trump's selection of a new Federal Reserve chairman on Nov. 2 was mostly a signal of continuity. \"To date, there has been more expectation of policy change than actual, tangible policy change,\" said Jason Furman, an economic adviser in the Obama White House. Some Trump efforts at change have been slowed by political speed bumps, like the Affordable Care Act repeal. Others have run into legal roadblocks, like the proposed ban on transgender service members. In other important ways, though, Trump has begun leaving his mark. Trump has led the biggest rollback of regulations since Ronald Reagan \u2014 a move that's been welcomed by many business people. \"They feel like the threat of over-regulation has subsided,\" said Senior Vice President Neil Bradley of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce. \"They have breathing room to focus on the fundamentals of their business. And that's completely generated this kind of sense of optimism about the future and their ability to grow their businesses.\" Immigration is another area where the election had big consequences. Trump has slashed the number of refugees the U.S. takes in, and he's begun phasing out Obama-era protection for hundreds of thousands of undocumented immigrants who were brought to the country as children. Deportations from the nation's interior have jumped 34 percent since Trump took office, and immigration officers are now casting a much wider net. \"There is no question that President Trump ran on a get-tough-on-immigration stance,\" said John Malcolm, a vice president at the Heritage Foundation. \"I think you're already seeing that in terms of the number of deportations and also the number of people attempting to enter our country.\" Trump's Environmental Protection Agency has also begun the lengthy process of lifting restriction on greenhouse gases from power plants. That move won't be felt right away, but it will make a difference five or 10 years from now. \"We're seeing continued emission reductions over the next few years, because a lot of those investments have been made. But the long-term signals are really dismaying,\" said Kate Larsen, who tracks greenhouse gases for the Rhodium Group. Trump has also rattled foreign policy circles with provocative rhetoric \u2014 calling the Iran nuclear deal an embarrassment, for example, and threatening to pull out of the North American Free Trade Agreement. Congress and his own advisers have tried to sand off some of the president's rougher edges, but the rest of the world has taken notice. \"What you're seeing, I think, is the accelerator being pushed down on the post-American world,\" said Derek Chollet, a former State Department and Pentagon official who's now with the German Marshall Fund. During the president's Asia trip, for example, other countries will relaunch their effort to forge an Asia-Pacific trade pact, minus the United States. Meanwhile, one of the biggest changes on the president's drawing board is the tax overhaul unveiled in the House on Nov. 2. That measure could have dramatic effects on business, government coffers, the federal deficit and income inequality, if it makes it through Congress \u2014 a big if. Trump has an ambitious timetable for the tax plan, hoping to sign it by the end of the year. But even if the ship of state moves more like Obama's ocean liner than a speedboat, Captain Trump is determined to chart a very different course.",

The tone Trump set on immigration has been picked up by both Republican candidates running for governor. In the two states electing new governors this year \u2014 New Jersey and Virginia \u2014 once-moderate Republicans are running attack ads painting their Democratic opponents as weak on illegal immigration. The ads are a move out of the political playbook of President Trump, who began his bid for the White House by attacking Mexican immigrants. \"They're bringing drugs. They're bringing crime. They're rapists,\" Trump said, at his 2015 campaign announcement. \"Some, I assume, are good people.\" Trump's stance on illegal immigration worked in last year's election, and state and local politicians facing tough races this cycle have taken notice. \"His philosophy is the one that's being implemented,\" said Stella Rouse, director of the Center for American Politics and Citizenship at the University of Maryland. But she cautions that using that strategy on a state level may be \"risky.\" The ads could alienate moderate Republicans in New Jersey and Virginia who have not fully bought into Trump's sales pitch. Nevertheless, GOP candidates are chasing his voters. \"[Trump] obviously won,\" Rouse said, \"so there is some sentiment or feeling that that is a winning strategy.\" The ads Lt. Gov. Kim Guadagno had focused her gubernatorial campaign on property taxes but has recently taken a harsh tone on illegal immigration.\n                \n                    \n                    Jeff Zelevansky/Getty Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption Lt. Gov. Kim Guadagno had focused her gubernatorial campaign on property taxes but has recently taken a harsh tone on illegal immigration. For a vast majority of her campaign, Republican candidate Kim Guadagno focused on her plan to lower New Jersey's notoriously high property taxes. She rarely spoke publicly without pitching her plan to streamline state government. Guadagno also reached out to the state's sizable Latino population, kicking off her campaign at a Mexican restaurant and choosing a Cuban running mate. But in October, still down by double digits in the polls to her Democratic opponent Phil Murphy, Guadagno released a TV ad titled \"Sanctuary.\" It opens with archive video of a shackled man in an orange prison jumpsuit. A gravelly-voiced narrator says: \"Illegal alien and child rapist Jose Carranza shot four New Jersey students in the head. Three died, shattering their families.\" The murders on a Newark schoolyard in 2007 became one of the grisliest crimes in recent memory in New Jersey. (A fourth victim was raped, stabbed and shot but survived.) Carranza, one of six perpetrators, was in the country illegally. The ad plays on a comment Murphy made at a press event when asked whether he would protect immigrants who are in the country illegally, even if some of them may have criminal backgrounds. \"My bias is gonna be having their backs,\" Murphy replied. The narrator draws the connection: \"Murphy doesn't have our backs. He has theirs.\" Murphy has said he would make New Jersey a \"sanctuary state\" if threats against immigrants in the country illegally from the Trump administration escalated, but he has provided few details.

Similar attack ads are airing in Virginia. Republican Ed Gillespie has been slamming Democrat Ralph Northam for voting against a bill that would have banned sanctuary cities in Virginia, even though none exist in that state. A former Republican National Committee chair who once spoke of diversifying the GOP, Gillespie shifted to the right after a bruising primary in the spring. In one ad, the Gillespie campaign implies that Northam's vote against the sanctuary city bill was a boon to the violent street gang MS-13, which was started by immigrants from El Salvador and has a presence in Virginia. \"Northam cast the deciding vote in favor of sanctuary cities that let illegal immigrants who commit crimes back on the street,\" a narrator says, \"increasing the threat of MS-13.\" 'Fear tactics' Both Phil Murphy in New Jersey and Ralph Northam in Virginia say violent criminals should be prosecuted, regardless of their immigration status. But that response has not stopped their Republican opponents from going all in on the illegal immigration message, even as studies that show immigrants in the country illegally commit crimes at a lower rate than native-born U.S. citizens. \"Using fear tactics to sort of divide groups is something that has been around for awhile,\" said Rouse. \"I think it's been applied to higher levels certainly since Trump came on the scene.\"",

The attack ads in both statewide gubernatorial elections claim their Democratic opponents wouldn't enforce immigration laws.  ARI SHAPIRO, HOST: Two states are electing new governors this year - New Jersey and Virginia. In both places, an ad war is playing out over illegal immigration. The Republican candidates in both of these states have released attack ads claiming the Democratic opponents would not enforce immigration laws and would endanger people living in those states. These two races are among the few statewide elections since President Trump won last fall. Joe Hernandez from member station WHYY reports. JOE HERNANDEZ, BYLINE: For months, Republican candidate Kim Guadagno focused her campaign for governor of New Jersey on a promise to lower property taxes. She also reached out to the state's sizable Latino population, kicking off her campaign at a Mexican restaurant and picking a Cuban running mate. But just a few weeks before the election, down heavily in the polls to her Democratic opponent, Guadagno released a TV ad entitled \"Sanctuary.\" It opens with an image of Jose Carranza in an orange prison jumpsuit. (SOUNDBITE OF POLITICAL AD, \"SANCTUARY\") UNIDENTIFIED MAN: Illegal alien and child rapist Jose Carranza shot four New Jersey students in the head. HERNANDEZ: Carranza was part of a brutal crime in Newark in 2007 that left three young people dead and one sexually assaulted, stabbed and shot. Carranza was in the country illegally. In the ad, Guadagno draws a direct link between that crime and her Democratic opponent Phil Murphy, who suggested he would block state and local cops from helping federal immigration officials. (SOUNDBITE OF POLITICAL AD, \"SANCTUARY\") UNIDENTIFIED MAN: Murphy will have the backs of deranged murderers like Carranza, providing sanctuary in New Jersey. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) PHIL MURPHY: We'll be a sanctuary not just city but state. UNIDENTIFIED MAN: Murphy doesn't have our backs. He has theirs. Phil Murphy - too dangerous for New Jersey. HERNANDEZ: Similar ads are airing in Virginia. There, Republican Ed Gillespie is slamming Democrat Ralph Northam for voting against a bill that would've banned sanctuary cities in Virginia, even though there aren't any. Gillespie, a former Republican National Committee chair who once spoke of diversifying the GOP, moved to the right after a tough primary this spring. In this TV ad, the Gillespie campaign implies that Northam's vote against the bill was a boon to the violent street gang MS-13, which was started by immigrants from El Salvador. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN: Northam cast the deciding vote in favor of sanctuary cities that let illegal immigrants who commit crimes back on the street, increasing the threat of MS-13. HERNANDEZ: Both Phil Murphy in New Jersey and Ralph Northam in Virginia say violent criminals should be prosecuted, regardless of their immigration status. But that hasn't stopped the Republican candidates in both states from going all in on the illegal immigration message. It's a page out of the political playbook of President Trump, who kicked off his presidential campaign attacking Mexican immigrants. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: They're bringing drugs. They're bringing crime. They're rapists. And some, I assume, are good people. STELLA ROUSE: His philosophy is the one that's being implemented. You can see that in these two races. HERNANDEZ: Stella Rouse is the director of the Center for American Politics and Citizenship at the University of Maryland. She says Republican candidates have to follow their party's voters. And those voters are with Trump on immigration. That's despite studies showing that immigrants in the country illegally commit crimes at lower rates than native-born U.S. citizens. Rouse says politicians are hoping the message that worked for Trump on the national level will be effective on the state level, too. ROUSE: It's a way to divide groups, to say, look, this group is a threat to our group. You know, it's a threat to our way of life. It's a threat to our values. HERNANDEZ: Whether that message works will be up to voters next Tuesday. For NPR News, I'm Joe Hernandez. Copyright \u00a9 2017 NPR.  All rights reserved.

MARY LOUISE KELLY, HOST: In an unfamiliar country, fitting in can be hard, especially if you're trying to make friends or even find romance. We're going to go now to an improv theater class in Berlin. Half the class is made up of refugees. And improvising their way through a new situation is something everyone's hoping to practice. This story is from our international podcast, Rough Translation. Here's correspondent Gregory Warner. (SOUNDBITE OF IMPROV REHEARSAL) UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN #1: Push. UNIDENTIFIED MAN #1: Fish. UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN #2: Fish. UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN #3: Fish. UNIDENTIFIED MAN #2: Fine. GREGORY WARNER, BYLINE: In a hipster rent-a-studio building in downtown Berlin, about a dozen people stumble through a sound association game. (LAUGHTER) WARNER: It's awkward, as all improv theater is, but even more so because this class is half Europeans, half refugees - mostly Syrian. The class is taught in German, but some here hardly speak it. SOPHIA LIERENFELD: (Speaking German). WARNER: Sophia Lierenfeld is the founder of this workshop. She calls it Improv Without Borders. She's tall with long, wavy hair, and she likes low-cut tops and dresses, but on the first day of class... LIERENFELD: I just really didn't know what I would face. I wasn't sure if I could be the person with the authority in a dress, for example. WARNER: Because what she'd heard on the news about men from Arabic-speaking countries. So that first day, she wore something uncharacteristically modest and covering. LIERENFELD: The next week, I was like, oh, come on, seriously. I'm just going to wear what I like. And it didn't change a thing. WARNER: Sophia hugs everyone who comes in. And if someone hesitates for too long in one of the improv games, they have to run around the circle shouting, I'm so sexy. UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN #4: I'm so sexy. (LAUGHTER) WARNER: Some people belt it out. Others just whisper. UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN #1: I am so sexy. UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN #5: Whoo. WARNER: Aktham Abdulhasn is from Syria. He's been a refugee in Berlin for two and a half years. He's here to try to be more confident. AKTHAM ABDULHASN: I'm sexy, and I know it. (LAUGHTER) WARNER: He says outside of improv, he's shy with women by nature. But he's also shy for another reason. And it's the mirror of the reason that Sophia dressed so modestly on the first day of class. He's terrified that German women will see him as the kind of refugee stereotype that they read about on the news. ABDULHASN: As a person who just can go harassing any woman he sees. WARNER: And his fear of that stereotype makes him flee the other way. He's paralyzed when he approaches women. But in improv... ABDULHASN: In a workshop about theater, you just can go wild. WARNER: Another participant is Raqhd Hadeed, a 19-year-old Syrian refugee. She says in two years of living in Germany, she has never made a German friend her own age. RAQHD HADEED: (Speaking German). WARNER: She's here in improv to seem more strong, less shy. But when one day before class in the subway a guy suddenly shoves her, she comes to class dejected. And it's Sophia, the teacher, who coaches her to stand up for herself. LIERENFELD: (Speaking German). HADEED: (Speaking German). LIERENFELD: (Speaking German). WARNER: She's saying, leave me alone. Now try it again, Sophia says. HADEED: (Speaking German). LIERENFELD: (Speaking German). WARNER: One weekend after class, Sophia even tries to help Aktham Abdulhasn. He's the refugee with the dating shyness. LIERENFELD: All right, now tell me more about this person that you met. WARNER: Sitting down at a cafe, Aktham tells her about his sole semi-romantic experience in Germany - a single date with a German med student. They had texted for a while, but then the woman cut it off. He was sure that he'd done something wrong, something culturally inappropriate. But he wasn't sure what. LIERENFELD: Do you still have the texts? ABDULHASN: I still have the texts, yes. LIERENFELD: Can I see them? ABDULHASN: Yeah. WARNER: Aktham scrolls through the text to show her. LIERENFELD: OK, while you're looking for that, this is an interesting question for me because I think there could be some cultural difference. How about the whole sex stuff? Do you have some one-night stands here in Berlin? Do you have... ABDULHASN: I never had. LIERENFELD: You never had one-night stands? You never had sex? ABDULHASN: Never had no one-night stands - no sex, no... LIERENFELD: So you're still a virgin? ABDULHASN: Yes. LIERENFELD: OK. ABDULHASN: Also by kissing. LIERENFELD: What by kissing? You've never kissed a girl? ABDULHASN: Never kissed a girl on the mouth, on the lips. LIERENFELD: OK, there's this whole difference to... WARNER: By this point, Aktham has found the texts, and he hands his phone over to Sophia. While she stares at the text, he studies her face. LIERENFELD: Wow, she's like straightforward. She wants to cook together - she wanted to. That's really nice. WARNER: Then Sophia mortifies Aktham by reading one of his texts outloud. It was when he was trying to organize a date to watch a soccer game. LIERENFELD: But I'm in for the game - smiley. Also ready for other plans - smiley. Tell me when and where, and I'm going to be there - smiley. That's so cute. (Laughter) Look at your face. Like, you look embarrassed, but it's really - it's charming. WARNER: Aktham's blushing, saying, you can punch me now. But Sophia's leaning toward him because actually she's about to tell him something that Aktham never understood about this interaction. LIERENFELD: So from her messages, she seems to be really interested in sex with you - like that's obvious. She's writing, we can cook together, which means you're already at her place, you know? The change happens after you met the second time. So my guess is that you probably did nothing wrong, but maybe you just didn't do a move - you know what I mean? ABDULHASN: Truthfully, I would feel scared to suggest such a thing. If she doesn't want to, and if she... WARNER: Aktham says he was terrified about being too forward. What if he offended her? And what if this wasn't a date at all? What if she had just gone out with him to be friends because he's a refugee? LIERENFELD: I'm going to say that in a little bit of a mean way, are you aware of your arrogance here? I get the whole thing. I understand your feelings. ABDULHASN: OK. LIERENFELD: But there's also one part in it that's really arrogant. And that's the part where you think that you have to think and decide for her. When you tell her that you're interested in her, she is totally fine with saying, no, I'm not. You know what I mean? ABDULHASN: Yeah, yeah, yeah, I never thought of it as... LIERENFELD: That's why I said so - in such a straight way. ABDULHASN: Because... WARNER: There are workshops on social norms for refugees, and they're popping up in different places around Europe. They're all aimed to teach refugees that no means no, and miniskirts aren't an invitation. But for Aktham, the problem is different. He's being too protective. ABDULHASN: I'm really now surprised how I never think about it this way. WARNER: Aktham's says since this class he has been more conscious of his body language and what signals he's sending. ABDULHASN: I try. I try, yeah. Yesterday, I did cross my arms lots of the times, but it's good. It's really good. WARNER: For years, he's been so worried about coming off as dangerous. Now he's checking in more with himself to make sure he feels safe. (SOUNDBITE OF QUANTIC'S \"ABSENCE HEARD, PRESENCE FELT\") KELLY: Gregory Warner reporting there.

            "article_content": "A top campaign issue in Germany's election is the deportation of migrants who are considered dangerous or who don't qualify for asylum. Germany's broken deportation system will make that difficult.  SCOTT SIMON, HOST: German voters go to the polls tomorrow to decide whether Chancellor Angela Merkel deserves a fourth term. Many Germans are palpably unhappy over her refugee policy. And candidates seeking to capitalize on voter anger promised more deportations. But as NPR's Soraya Sarhaddi Nelson reports, that's far more difficult than those candidates suggest. (SOUNDBITE OF METAL CLANGING) SORAYA SARHADDI NELSON, BYLINE: This former prison in Bueren is at near capacity, with more than 130 male migrants waiting to be taken to the airport and deported. It's the largest such detention center in Germany. The director, Nicolas Rinoesl, says the doors here are still the old prison ones. (SOUNDBITE OF METAL CLANGING) NELSON: With heavy latches and locks, the rooms are more inviting. NICOLAS RINOESL: I always compare it with a youth hostel standard if you look at the furniture, for example. You have the TV. You have a fridge. NELSON: And pots, for migrants who prefer to cook their own meals with ingredients bought at the store here. Residents are free to move around inside the walls and visit with family. They also have a soccer field and gym, a game room and Internet as well as robust medical and dental care. Rinoesl says the offerings are linked to a European Court of Justice ruling three years ago. It also mandated migrants awaiting deportation in EU countries no longer be housed with convicts, the director says. RINOESL: Deportation custody must be more liberal than criminal custody because it's not a punishment. It's just to make sure that they leave the country. NELSON: State governments haven't been thrilled about the detention centers. The money to run the centers comes from their budgets. And after the European court order, the German states decided to close all but six of them. Instead, they have focused on persuading migrants who don't qualify for asylum to leave voluntarily, offering money and assurances they can return if they secure a visa. Berlin was one of the German states that closed its deportee detention center, says Martin Pallgen, a spokesman for the local interior ministry. MARTIN PALLGEN: (Speaking German). NELSON: He says more than 12,000 migrants in Berlin who would have faced deportation agreed to leave voluntarily in 2016 and the first half of this year. That's four and a half times the number who were forcibly deported during that time. But not having a detention center soon caused problems. Die Welt newspaper reported police in Berlin were forced to let 40 Turkish deportees go last year. At the last minute, the Turkish government refused to take them back, and the German authorities had no place to legally house them. Rinoesl, the Bueren Center director, says deportation orders are increasing after last December's terror attack in Berlin by a rejected asylum-seeker from Tunisia. RINOESL: And it's often that we don't have even enough places. NELSON: He says he's been given money to build 35 more rooms. And three new centers are scheduled to be opened in other German states. But the German interior ministry estimates more than 200,000 migrants here qualify for deportation. So even that expansion won't be enough. Soraya Sarhaddi Nelson, NPR News, Bueren.

It expressed the fear of Chinese immigrants, which led to the passage of the Chinese Exclusion Act 135 years ago.\n                \n\n                    George Frederick Keller/Historical Society of Pennsylvania\n                    \n\nhide caption A Statue for Our Harbor was published in 1881. It expressed the fear of Chinese immigrants, which led to the passage of the Chinese Exclusion Act 135 years ago. A Chinese man stands on a pedestal surrounded by a harbor as a cartoon imitation of the Statue of Liberty. His clothes are tattered, his hair is in a long, thin tail, his eyes squint. The words \"diseases,\" \"filth,\" \"immorality,\" and \"ruin to white labor\" float around his head. This man is the center of an iconic image from 1881 called \"A Statue for Our Harbor,\" made by the cartoonist George Frederick Keller. The image reflects the widespread anti-Chinese and anti-immigrant sentiment of the time, and was used to drum up support for the passage of the Chinese Exclusion Act, which turns 135 on Saturday. The law limited Chinese immigration and barred them from becoming naturalized U.S. citizens. Experts point to the parallels between the political climate of the exclusion era and today: a close and contentious presidential election that stirred anti-immigrant sentiment; the growing economic anxiety of white Americans; and policies that would drastically shape the country's immigration laws. On Saturday, a group of Asian American activists are organizing a rally in San Francisco to acknowledge the anniversary of the Chinese Exclusion Act and to \"learn from our past and prevent it from repeating,\" according to Cynthia Choi, who works with Chinese For Affirmative Action, one of the groups organizing the event. \"This is important for the Chinese American and broader Asian American community, to stand up against the new targets to this new form of exclusion, for us to say it was wrong 135 years ago and it's wrong today,\" Choi said. \"We're in a unique period where... accurate information is not as easily attained, so there are a number of people who are on the fence, who are confused about the policies, who \u2014 more dangerously \u2014 feel as though this doesn't affect them.\" Then And Now: Race And Class \"Beginning in 1882, the United States stopped being a nation of immigrants that welcomed foreigners without restrictions, borders or gates. Instead, it became a ... gatekeeping nation,\" Erika Lee, a professor at the University of Minnesota, wrote in her book At America's Gates: Chinese Immigration During The Exclusion Era, 1882-1943. \"In the process, the very definition of what it meant to be an 'American' became even more exclusionary.\" The Chinese exclusion law was the very first time in American history that immigrants were barred because of their race and class. In 1882, when Congress passed the law, there were 39,600 men and women from China who arrived in the U.S. Just three years later, there were only 22, according to early records that Lee came across in her research. The 1876 presidential race between Rutherford Hayes and Samuel Tilden was a major turning point in the country's stance on immigration. Leading up to the election, the race was so close and electoral votes were so coveted, it brought California's ongoing fight to push out Chinese immigrants to the national stage, Lee said. Many Californians worried that Chinese laborers would take their jobs, and that they were sexually lecherous threats to society. Lee said that anti-immigrant measures in the 1880s \u2014 and today \u2014 were driven by both working class people and elites, as well as those who had a \"vested economic interest in border walls and detention centers.\" The Chinese Exclusion Act set the groundwork for immigrant detention centers and the country's first large-scale deportation of a single immigrant group. Specifically, the exclusion era brought an expansion of the federal government in terms of hiring more immigrant inspectors, whose responsibilities included working as interpreters and at the detention facilities. As for today's parallel? Lee points to companies that are vying to build a U.S.-Mexico border wall, and the question of whether there will be more privately-owned immigrant detention centers under President Trump. Lee says that today's equivalent is the proposed so-called \"Muslim ban,\" because it singles out specific groups of people for discrimination. \"The fact that we don't explicitly name Muslims [in the executive order] is more of a reflection of how our racial sensibilities have changed over the past 135 years, in terms of being more polite in our racism.\" And, Lee says, like the proposed ban \u2014 which Trump says will be in place until vetting procedures are strengthened \u2014 the Chinese Exclusion Act was also originally proposed as a temporary law. The exclusion act was meant to be law for a decade but lasted 61 years. It was repealed in 1943 with the Magnuson Act, when the U.S. wanted to foster an alliance with China in the war against Japan. In 2012, Congress passed a resolution formally expressing regret to Chinese Americans for the exclusion law and other discriminatory measures. But while there are many links between the exclusion era and today, there are also important differences. Trump's immigration orders have created \"one of the most divisive eras around immigration\" in history, Lee told NPR. And his policies have had wide-reaching consequences for immigrants that have been met with protests across the country. \"I cannot think of another time or a set of laws that has the promise to transform immigration so dramatically at every level,\" Lee said. Trump's policies have included banning refugees, increasing border security and interior enforcement, expanding deportation and expedited removal, reforming the H1-B visa program and attempting to enact a travel ban. Still, Lee said, what's different is the nationwide grassroots efforts and legal challenges that have sprung up against Trump's immigration policies. \"There were no protests in support of Chinese immigrants [during the exclusion era in the U.S.],\" Lee said. But it's unclear if some immigrants today draw a link between the historical exclusions and Trump's various immigration restrictions, according to Janelle Wong, the director of the Asian American studies program at the University of Maryland, College Park. \"On the one hand, more than 60 percent of Asian-American registered voters oppose a 'Muslim Ban.' This is pretty consistent across groups,\" Wong wrote in an email, citing her work on the National Asian American Survey. \"On the other hand, the survey also shows that about 20 percent of Chinese Americans, and Asian-American registered voters as a whole, support such a ban. This, despite the fact that Chinese were the first in U.S. history to be excluded according to these kinds of ascriptive characteristics.\" Choi, the rally organizer, said she feels that while the Chinese Americans who support the ban are a minority, \"they're a vocal one.\" Choi said that many of the rally's speeches will be translated into Cantonese and Mandarin, which she hopes will draw in people who might only speak Chinese. In 1885, a student named Saum Song Bo wrote a scathing open letter in a New York newspaper. He was struck by the irony that the U.S. was erecting the Statue Of Liberty three years after passing the Chinese Exclusion Act: \"That statue represents Liberty holding a torch which lights the passage of those of all nations who come into this country. But are the Chinese allowed to come? As for the Chinese who are here, are they allowed to enjoy liberty as men of all other nationalities enjoy it? Are they allowed to go about everywhere free from the insults, abuse, assaults, wrongs and injuries from which men of other nationalities are free?\" Liberty, for Bo and many other immigrants in that era, felt out of reach.",

Ileana Ros-Lehtinen, the first Cuban-American elected to Congress and the first congressional Republican to publicly support marriage equality, is retiring next year at the end of her term. Ros-Lehtinen, 64, will have spent almost three decades in Congress, having been elected for the first time in 1989. Her unexpected retirement was first reported by the Miami Herald on Sunday, and confirmed in an open letter published by the paper later Sunday afternoon. Rep.

Ileana Ros-Lehtinen addresses attendees at the launch of a public service announcement about LGBT nondiscrimination that featured her family in 2016. Ros-Lehtinen was the first congressional Republican to publicly support gay marriage, and has been a vocal advocate of LGBT rights. \"It's been such a delight and a high honor to serve our community for so many years and help constituents every day of the week,\" she told The Herald in a phone interview. \"We just said, 'It's time to take a new step.' \" The Republican congresswoman said she had no doubt she could've won re-election had she sought it in 2018, despite a shifting political climate in her district. The newly-redrawn 27th District covers much of southeast Miami-Dade County, and Democrat Hillary Clinton won it by more than 20 percentage points over Donald Trump in the 2016 election. It was Clinton's largest margin of victory of any Republican-held district in the country, according to The Herald, and although Ros-Lehtinen beat her Democratic opponent by 10 percentage points, it was her closest re-election in years. Since Trump's election, Ros-Lehtinen has been among the president's most vocal Republican dissenters in Congress. She said she did not vote for Trump in last year's general election, and has disagreed with him on immigration, transgender rights, budget cuts, and health care. \"I don't agree with many, if not most, positions of President Trump,\" she told The Herald. Democrats were already said to be eyeing Florida's 27th District as a seat they could turn in 2018, so with Ros-Lehtinen now officially out of the picture, the party is expected to pour resources into an election without a clear Republican heir apparent. \"Big Bad Wolf\" Born in Havana, Ros-Lehtinen and her family fled the Castro regime in Cuba when she was 8 years old. She was a fierce critic of Cuban politics, even garnering the nickname \"the big bad wolf\" from Fidel Castro. She became the first woman to chair a standing congressional committee, the House Committee on Foreign Affairs, according to the Associated Press, and made a name for herself as a foreign-policy hawk. More recently, the congresswoman has been notable for her stances on LGBT issues. She has a transgender son, who is an outspoken activist, and in 2012, Ros-Lehtinen became the first Republican in congress to publicly support marriage equality. Congresswoman Ros-Lehtinen was featured in this 2016 Human Rights Campaign video, talking about transgender rights. Prior to serving in the U.S. House of Representatives, Ros-Lehtinen was also the first Hispanic woman to serve in the Florida House of Representatives and the Florida Senate. Former Florida Governor Jeb Bush worked as her campaign manager during her first campaign for Congress in 1989, and Florida Sen. Marco Rubio worked in her office as an intern in the 1990s. 26 years ago this summer I worked as intern with @RosLehtinen She has served our community, state & country well.

At the public library in the rural Morgan County town of Brush, Colo., Marissa Velazquez welcomes her students to class. It's a sunny Saturday morning, and the day marks the halfway point in Velazquez's class, a 10-week crash course on American history, civics and English. Nearly all of the students work in either meatpacking or dairying. Everyone in it has the same goal: become an American citizen. In two hours, Velazquez runs through voting rights, the legislative process and some grammar tips. Pop quiz: When do we celebrate the venerable American holiday of Flag Day? Answer: June. Despite the fact that many natural-born Americans probably don't know the answer, Flag Day is a potential topic on the test for U.S. citizenship. While Velazquez runs through the history of voting rights in the U.S., she asks the students if any of them would have been able to vote in the mid-1800s. The answer is no. No student would have been able to vote in America's early years. The class includes middle-aged women and young men of Mexican and Central American descent, and men from war-torn African countries.

It now holds sizable Somali, Mexican, Ethiopian, El Salvadoran, Guatemalan and Honduran populations. \"We have students from Mexico, from Guatemala, El Salvador and from Ethiopia,\" says Velazquez, who came to Morgan County from Mexico as a child. \"Some are refugees, and some, like me, were brought here by their family.\" Like many immigrants in the U.S., those in Morgan County are worried that changes to immigration policy pushed by the Trump administration could impact their families. Panic has swept through communities of immigrants all over the country, in highly visible places like Los Angeles and New York. But in some smaller towns with less visible immigrant communities, that same fear has spurred some to take steps to go from green card holders to fully fledged citizens. The number of people who applied for U.S. citizenship rose across the country in 2016. And while there are no definitive data for the first part of 2017, there are small indications that the same trend could be continuing this year. To become naturalized, applicants are tested with a series of questions about the U.S. They are given a dictation exam and an interview, most often in English. \"That's why we get to practice listening skills, writing skills, reading, so that they're ready for when they go in for their interview to become a citizen,\" Velazquez says. \"I never thought I would teach the class, because I took this class as a student,\" says Velazquez, who became a naturalized citizen in 2016. Citizenship classes are pretty standard in some parts of the country, often offered by nonprofit groups and immigration law firms. What makes this one unique is its size. In 2015, 10 people finished it. In 2016, just five. This year, Velazquez has a class of 21 students. In a rural area like Morgan County, that is huge. A student uses notecards to learn facts about American government during a class at the public library in Brush, Colo.\n                \n                    \n                    Luke Runyon/Harvest Public Media\n                    \n                \nhide caption A student uses notecards to learn facts about American government during a class at the public library in Brush, Colo. Since the 2016 presidential election, a renewed focus on immigration has left more immigrants feeling uncertain, even those with legal, permanent status. That keeps Lisa Pray, the only immigration attorney in Morgan County, busy. Pray says she has noticed more of her clients asking about the citizenship process. Pray says she is hearing from longer-term residents \u2014 people who've been in town for more than a decade. \"There's a lot of fear in the community,\" Pray says. \"Usually people who'd been here a long time, they decided to get their citizenship when they had some relative they wanted to bring over. \"Now, what I'm hearing from people is, 'I just want to make sure I get to stay.' \" When President Trump began signing executive orders expanding the immigrants eligible for deportation and restricting international travel from some Muslim-majority countries, Pray says, Morgan County's sizable immigrant population was shaken. But the fear has also acted as a motivator. \"It has spurred a lot of people who are permanent [residents] to apply, or decide to get their citizenship,\" she says. The Department of Homeland Security's Office of Immigration Statistics holds official records for the number of people who become naturalized citizens each year. It's too early to put a definitive number on whether this surge of interest turns into an increase in the number of new citizens. Immigrants choose to go through the naturalization process for many reasons, including gaining the right to vote, to freely travel and to rest easy about immigration status. \"This is one of the big benefits associated with becoming a U.S. citizen: You can't be deported,\" says Mark Hugo-Lopez, director of Hispanic research at the Pew Research Center. The number of people seeking citizenship tends to ebb and flow, often peaking when the application fee is set to rise or during an election year. Roughly 1 million people applied to be naturalized citizens in 2016, the highest number in nearly a decade. A previous record was set in fiscal year 2007 when, ahead of an increase in the application fee, nearly 1.4 million people applied to be naturalized. Hugo-Lopez, though, says there are still millions of eligible immigrants not seeking citizenship. \"Many of them, when you ask them, will say they want to become one, but they will also cite reasons like the cost and language being potential barriers,\" he says. \"They will also say, for example, they're busy, they're working, they don't have the time, they haven't even thought about it.\" As the class wraps up in Brush, the students file out. This week's homework is to study up on amendments to the Constitution \u2014 all 27 of them.

That's why I escaped from my country,\" Baraki says. \"After that, the American government is helping me come here.\" In a few months he'll be eligible to take the test, having been in the U.S. for five years. \"That is why I take a class.

Tusk has received a letter from British Prime Minister Theresa May invoking Article 50 of the bloc's key treaty, the formal start of exit negotiations.\n                \n                    \n                    Virginia Mayo/AP\n                    \n                \nhide caption European Council President Donald Tusk holds up the document from the U.K. in Brussels on Wednesday. Tusk has received a letter from British Prime Minister Theresa May invoking Article 50 of the bloc's key treaty, the formal start of exit negotiations. Today the United Kingdom formally told the European Union it is leaving, after decades of membership in the 28-nation political alliance and trading bloc. The move triggers an estimated two-year divorce process that will involve many months of tough negotiations and will launch Britain on a new, uncertain path. Addressing the House of Commons in London, Prime Minister Theresa May said Brexit is an opportunity for her country to chart a new course, unencumbered by the bureaucracy of the multilateral organization based in Brussels. \"This is an historic moment from which there can be no turning back,\" said May. \"We're going to make our own decisions and our own laws. We're going to take control of the things that matter most to us.\" Britain's feisty press captured the ambivalence of the U.K. people, who voted 52 percent to 48 percent last June to quit the EU. \"Freedom!\" crowed the Daily Mail, the conservative tabloid. The left-leaning Guardian ran a map of Western Europe as a jigsaw puzzle with the pieces of the U.K. taken out. In the empty white space that remained were the words: \"Today, Britain steps into the unknown.\" While May tried to strike a confident tone, many who voted to remain in the EU fear Brexit will damage the country. \"I feel rather concerned and worried about it, really,\" said Linda Roberts, 68, as she waited at London's Euston station earlier this week for a train home to the north of England. Roberts said many people voted to leave the EU because they were unhappy with the free flow of immigrants into Britain that EU membership required, and hadn't thought through the broader implications. She worries Brexit will impose a huge opportunity cost on many young British citizens, including her own daughter. Coming from outside the EU, they are unlikely to be able to work visa-free in European cities like Paris or Barcelona. Roberts' daughter is in advertising, said Roberts, \"and a lot of the work is abroad. I know they say [Brexit is] opening up everything. Well, we're already opened up to the rest of the world. Actually, we are just cutting off Europe, which I think is a big mistake.\" Pro-Brexit sentiment has strong parallels to the political climate in the United States, where President Trump has criticized the European Union, shunned multilateral trade deals and declared an \"America First\" agenda. In fact, Trump was a big supporter of Brexit and called himself \"Mr. Brexit\" during his presidential campaign, correctly predicting he would pull off a similar upset in November's election. As in the U.S., immigration and rural resentment also played a role in the Brexit vote. \"There is a sense, certainly amongst the rural parts of the U.K., that they feel London and the elites running the country are part of a globalist conspiracy,\" said Christoph Meyer, a professor of European and international politics at King's College London. \"That is something you see in other countries as well, the sense that local, national identities are seen as threatened by markets and by immigration.\" The British are known for understatement, but political observers here speak of Brexit in superlatives. They say it could prove transformational for the country \u2013 for good or ill. Although the British economy has held up well so far, British people are already poorer as the value of the British pound remains 16 percent below its high last June. Britain's Prime Minister Theresa May signs the official letter to European Council President Donald Tusk invoking Article 50 and signaling the United Kingdom's intention to leave the EU.\n                \n                    \n                    AFP/AFP/Getty Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption Britain's Prime Minister Theresa May signs the official letter to European Council President Donald Tusk invoking Article 50 and signaling the United Kingdom's intention to leave the EU. \"Brexit is a weird combination of looking at the [2008] global financial crisis and knowing it is going to happen ... blended in with a kind of Suez Crisis,\" said Robin Niblett, the director of Chatham House, the London think tank. The 1956 Suez Crisis erupted when Britain and France invaded Egypt to take back the Suez Canal, only to have a far more powerful United States force them to withdraw. It was seen as a major milestone in the continuing decline of the British Empire. \"At that moment, we were suddenly discovering that we couldn't keep empire \u2014 that the United States was coming up and becoming the big kid on the block,\" said Niblett. \"It required a real redefinition of self \u2014 not just of the British government, but the British people.\" Not unlike where the United Kingdom finds itself today. After Brexit, Britain will have to define itself independently and outside of the European Union, where it has enjoyed far more economic bargaining power as part of the world's largest collective market. Niblett said Britain may choose to see itself through the lens of its national mythology \u2014 as a plucky island nation off the coast of Europe with global ambitions, punching above its weight. \"If it can get a good deal with the EU, then Britain can \u2014 in a way \u2014 have its cake and eat it,\" said Niblett. That's a big if. Even as it turns its back on the European Union, the U.K. wants to maintain as much access as possible to this huge single market. But with 27 nations, the EU will have far more leverage than the United Kingdom in the coming negotiations over a new trade deal. \"There is very little incentive for the current EU member states to give the U.K. a great deal,\" said Meyer. \"If the U.K. was able to go home and say, 'This is a political victory,' that would be seen as a threat to the rest of the EU because it would encourage populist movements.\" There are populist movements in Europe, like Marine Le Pen's National Front in France, that want to pull out of the EU as well. Meyer says the last thing the EU needs are populists looking at a future U.K.-EU trade deal and saying, \"Look, it's not so bad.\"",

Many Democratic women, in particular, are feeling a strong need to answer that call. Less than a quarter of elected positions are filled by women in the U.S. There are many reasons for that, but Democratic activist Diane Fink says women are often discouraged somewhere along the way.

In Maryland, Fink says, her group's aim is to have at least half of Maryland's political power belong to females. \"And to build the pipeline,\" she adds. \"We have no female delegates to Congress.\" We sat down with some of these women in the training program to talk about how they got here, and what sparked their political ambitions.

Wednesday's vote will force far-right politician Geert Wilders into second place along with two other parties, the Christian Democratic Appeal and the Democracy party D66, exit polls predict. Prime Minister Mark Rutte's center-right party is celebrating a resounding win over populist Geert Wilders' Party for Freedom, in a result that's being welcomed by centrists and progressives in France and Germany, which will also hold national elections this year. \"I warmly congratulate @markrutte for his clear victory against extremism,\" French President Francois Hollande tweeted Thursday. \"The Netherlands, oh the Netherlands you are a champion!\" tweeted Peter Altmaier, chief of staff for German Chancellor Angela Merkel. \"Congratulations on this great result.\" Maintaining the edge it established in early poll results, Rutte's VVD Party currently has 33 seats in the 150-seat legislature, compared with 20 for Wilders' party. Two other parties are close behind, with 19 seats each. That's the picture as of around noon local time Thursday in the Netherlands, with ballots in 382 of 388 municipalities counted, according to public broadcast outlet NOS. The decisive victory comes after months of polls that suggested either a Wilders victory or at least a tight outcome in an election that was defined by talk of immigration and anti-European Union sentiment. During the campaign, Wilders' anti-Muslim stance helped him ride a wave of support \u2014 his party was once projected to win nearly 40 seats. But in the Netherlands, at least, that wave seems to have crested in the wake of agenda-shifting votes in the U.K. and the U.S. last year.

As the news outlet NL Times notes, progressive and centrist parties such as GroenLinks gained seats this week. Polling stations saw high turnout, creating a tough task for Dutch election officials who've been hand-counting ballots due to concerns over possible hacking of the vote. Both Rutte and Wilders cast their ballots in The Hague. After he visited the polling station, Wilders told reporters that momentum was on his side, regardless of the results. \"Whatever the outcome of the election today, the genie will not go back into the bottle,\" he said. \"People feel misrepresented.\"",

And she wanted to lobby Turks here - there is a very big Turkish community here in Holland - to vote on a referendum back home to increase power for the president - back there in Turkey. The government here did not want a Turkish political battle coming to Dutch soil. So the Dutch police actually stopped the government minister and then took her back to Germany. This caused riots on Saturday night in Rotterdam. And the Turkish president, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, he was furious about this. And he called the Dutch government a bunch of fascists. GREENE: Well, OK, Frank, how does that whole flare-up play into the Dutch election? LANGFITT: Well, Erdogan says it, from his perspective, is all actually really about Dutch politics. He thinks that the government here is trying to look tough before Wednesday's election, especially because it's facing this challenge from Wilders. There's been a long debate over whether Turkey should join the European Union. Wilders is bitterly against it, and here's how he put it in a 2015 video. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) GEERT WILDERS: You are no Europeans, and you will never be. An Islamic state like Turkey does not belong to Europe. All the values Europe stands for - freedom, democracy, human rights - are incompatible with Islam. So Turkey, stay away from us. GREENE: OK, so real anti-Turkey talk there. And that was something that Wilders said before. And that, really, I guess, has made this whole issue with Turkey the backdrop. I mean, is he coming out of this whole flare-up with Turkey ahead as we approach this election? LANGFITT: Well, it's very complicated. I mean, even yesterday, he actually was saying any Turks who, you know, feel like they really want to vote in this Turkish election, they should go back to Turkey. They really like the president there. They should go back. So he's using it, in some ways, to divide the nation and point out that there is a big immigrant or even second-generation community here, kind of raising questions about their identity. On the other hand, Mark Rutte, the prime minister here, he was the one who took the hard line against the Turks. And political parties and the public have rallied around him. So in the short run, it seems - and we're getting really close to the election - it actually seems to have also helped the prime minister quite a bit. GREENE: Tell me a little bit about Wilders if you can, Frank, this populist candidate. What's he like on the campaign trail? LANGFITT: It was fascinating. I was actually down in the south with him on Saturday. It's a rare opportunity. You know, because of all of his anti-Islam rhetoric, he's been under death threat for years. So he lives in isolation, he - under high security. He rarely goes out and campaigns. When I saw him in this little town, he was surrounded by two to three dozen cops. It was this really tight scrum. There were always, it seemed, helicopters overhead. And I was with a Dutch colleague. She noticed he had a crease in the shoulder of his suit coat, which showed that he was actually wearing a bulletproof vest underneath. In the crowds, he's very personable. He took tons of selfies. And also, it's really interesting. He has this bleached-blond pompadour. And it's very striking. And he kind of looks like a lion. GREENE: That's interesting. And how do people react to him? LANGFITT: Very warm. Many people feel he's really looking out for ordinary Dutch in all of this. I was talking to a woman named Denise Ganssen. She's in her early 30s. Here's what she said. DENISE GANSSEN: He's like a real leader. He's very strong. He's a strong politician. He really stands up for what he believes in. I mean, he gave up - he gave up his freedom to fight for ours, which makes him, like - he's a hero. GREENE: OK, so he's a hero to Denise. Frank, how is he supposed to do when this vote happens on Wednesday? LANGFITT: Well, it's interesting. He had been leading for months, but he's been slipping in the polls. And while some people may see Wilders as possibly being another big blow for populism here in Holland and in Europe, in fact, he may not do that well. And it may be seen as a big setback. GREENE: All right. That is NPR's Frank Langfitt in Amsterdam setting up the Dutch elections, which are coming this Wednesday. Frank, thanks. LANGFITT: Happy to do it, David.

            "article_content": "Assistant Attorney General Kimberly Strovink, of Massachusetts Attorney General Healey's Civil Rights Division, answers calls coming into the state's hate hotline.\n                \n                    \n                    Tovia Smith/NPR\n                    \n                \nhide caption Assistant Attorney General Kimberly Strovink, of Massachusetts Attorney General Healey's Civil Rights Division, answers calls coming into the state's hate hotline. Editor's note: This story contains language that may be offensive to some readers. Harassment, threats and intimidation of minorities and immigrants spiked nationwide after President Trump's election in November. Comprehensive statistics are hard to come by, but officials and watch groups say hate-motivated incidents remain higher than usual more than three months after Election Day. Massachusetts is among the many states that have seen such a spike. \"There was one night, where my parents and I were walking out of a department store,\" recalls Nadia Butt, 36, of Danvers, Mass., a suburb north of Boston. \"And two white males yelled ... 'F****** immigrants go home!' \" Butt says she froze. So did her parents, American citizens who emigrated from Pakistan 40 years ago. \"My dad just kept hugging me as I was crying and just kept repeating that in all of his years of living here, he has never experienced such hatred,\" says Butts. The rise in incidents like this one spurred Massachusetts Attorney General Maura Healey to set up a new phone hotline to field hate and harassment complaints and track their frequency. \"I just thought it was so important that we be clear that here in Massachusetts we're going to enforce civil rights laws, we're going to prosecute hate crimes and we're going to be paying attention,\" says Healey. The calls flooded in right away. Officials say they've gotten some 250 substantive reports since the election, half of those in November alone. A racist and threatening video was circulated at a local school; an immigrant, in the country illegally, was physically assaulted by a co-worker; two Jewish community centers received bomb threats; and a mosque received a letter calling for ethnic cleansing. \"The kinds of incidents that we're seeing are really scary and troubling,\" Healey says. A rising star among state Democrats, Healey is a vocal Trump critic. She says the hotline has received calls from Trump supporters who say they're being harassed. But most frequently, Healey says, the targets are perceived immigrants and minorities, and the hateful messages often invoke Trump's name, or reference his words. \"Unfortunately what we saw over the last 18 months from Donald Trump were statements that were misogynist, racist, homophobic, xenophobic,\" says Healey. \"And that unfortunately seems to have been matched by this increase, this real uptick in hate crimes and bias incidents.\" In a news conference this week, President Trump denied any part in inspiring \"racism and horrible things that are put up,\" saying the nation was already \"seriously divided\" before he was elected. He blamed \"people on the other side\" for the rise in these incidents, suggesting that his political opponents are trying to frame his supporters as the culprits. He focused less on denouncing the hate, as he did during an interview with 60 Minutes in November. \"I will say this and I will say right to the cameras: Stop it,\" he said about the dozens of acts of harassment and intimidation against minorities that were reported after his election, many of which were allegedly performed in his name In the first month after the election, the Southern Poverty Law Center, a hate watch group, cataloged 1,094 bias-related incidents nationwide, based on local news reports. Massachusetts was near the top of the group's list, with 53 incidents, trailing only California (125), New York (94) and Texas (71), and tied with Washington state. Mark Potok, a senior fellow at SPLC, says clearly this spike isn't restricted to states where Trump prevailed in November. \"This is not a phenomenon that is only occurring, say, in the Deep South, or in the very red states out West,\" Potok says. \"There are enormous numbers of Americans who feel very uncomfortable with the way the country is changing \u2014 more and more people who are foreign-born, more and more Muslims, more people who, in one way or another, do not look like what many people think of as a sort of normal red-blooded American.\" In Massachusetts, the attorney general can respond to a hotline report with a criminal or civil case, though more commonly, her office will assist \u2014 or prod \u2014 local prosecutors and police to act. Frequently, no perpetrator is ever identified, and no charges result. But prosecution is not the hotline's only goal. Staffers also offer up some much-appreciated sympathy and share outrage with callers on the other end of the line. Eniola Soyemi, a Boston University graduate student from Nigeria, is one of many callers who say that just being heard and having her ordeal officially documented was therapeutic in itself. After the election, she experienced what she describes as a torrent of racist harassment. \"These kinds of incidents demoralize you as a human being,\" Soyemi says. \"And even though you know deep, deep down inside you that that person is morally wrong, you do need other people to verify that. And I think it does help you move on from such an incident.\" Similar hotlines also have been set up in New York and Maryland. Besides supporting victims and prosecuting offenders, officials are hoping to gather some better data on how the current \"hate wave\" may heat up or cool down over time.",

Surprise and a desire for retaliation are some of the reactions to President Trump's temporary ban on travelers from seven Muslim-majority countries. The ban, abruptly imposed Friday, led the Organization of Islamic Cooperation, a 57-nation body that's based in Saudi Arabia, to call on the U.S. to \"maintain its moral obligation to provide leadership and hope at a time of great uncertainty and unrest in the world.\" Expressing its \"grave concern\" about the policy, the group said that refugees \"have been adversely and unjustly affected\" \u2014 and it added that the policy also plays into the hands of extremist groups that have accused the U.S. of waging war on Muslims. The ban on people traveling from Iraq, Iran, Syria, Yemen, Sudan, Libya and Somalia is slated to last for 90 days. In addition, new refugee admissions are suspended for 120 days and Syrian refugees are banned indefinitely. Here's a rundown of reactions from countries that now find themselves on an undesirable U.S. list: Iraq \"Iraqis seem shocked by the ban\" imposed by one of its allies, NPR's Alice Fordham reports on today's Morning Edition. Parliament has approved a plan for a reciprocal ban on Americans, which would need cabinet approval before taking effect, Alice says. She adds that Iraq's former ambassador to the U.S., Lukman Faily, says he's been told he can't travel to the U.S. The ban shows \"swagger and an arrogance,\" influential Shiite cleric Muqtada al-Sadr says, noting that Americans are allowed to freely enter many countries \u2014 including those on its banned list. How the order goes over in Iraq is especially important because that country's government has been a key ally to the U.S. in the war on ISIS. Iraq is also home to about 6,000 U.S. troops who are aiding domestic forces on the front line against ISIS. pic.twitter.com/1Q6Im1xJJe Iran State-run IRNA news agency complained of \"U.S. terrorism double standards,\" noting that Saudi Arabia is not on Trump's list. As NPR's Greg Myre pointed out, the radicalized Muslims who carried out deadly attacks in the U.S., beginning on Sept. 11, 2001, came from these countries: Saudi Arabia, Egypt, Lebanon, United Arab Emirates, Pakistan, Russia and Kyrgyzstan. None of those countries are on Trump's list. Tehran will \"take reciprocal measures\" against U.S. nationals who want to travel to Iran, First Vice-President Eshaq Jahangiri promised Monday. The Foreign Ministry calls the ban \"insulting,\" while also saying any retaliation will be \"proportionate\" and will be made \"while respecting the American people and differentiating between them and the hostile policies of the U.S. Government.\" Syria The country's government so far hasn't released an official response to Friday's order. However, state-run SANA media highlighted international criticism of Trump's immigration ban and the U.S. president's low approval ratings in a new Gallup poll. SANA cited calls from the international community and American protesters for Trump to reconsider the ban. A month ago, Syrian President Bashar Assad had praised Trump's approach to terrorism and said that the new U.S. president would be a \"natural ally.\" As NPR's Deb Amos noted, \"More than 50 percent of Muslim refugees admitted to the U.S. last year come from Syria and Somalia.\" Yemen Attempts to \"classify Yemen or its citizens as a possible source of terrorism are illegal and illegitimate,\" the government says. The Foreign Ministry said that while it is \"aware that such action is the sovereign right for the United States, however, identifying specific countries as potential sources of terrorists ... needs more assessment and revision.\" Yemen also characterized a deadly U.S. raid that was carried out Sunday as \"state terrorism committed by the United States under the pretext of fighting terrorism.\" That raid targeting al-Qaida in the Arabian Peninsula resulted in the death of a U.S. service member as well as 14 militants, officials say. But the Pentagon is looking into reports that it also killed women and children \u2014 including the 8-year-old granddaughter of Nasser al-Awlaki \u2014 a former Yemeni minister of agriculture whose son, killed by the U.S. in 2011, was an al-Qaida proselytizer. Sudan America's envoy in Khartoum was summoned by Sudan's Foreign Ministry to hear the country's protests against Trump's decision, which came at a time of increasing cooperation between the U.S. and Sudan. Sudan's government has been working to be taken off the U.S. list of state sponsors of terrorism \u2014 just weeks ago, President Obama eased economic sanctions against the country that had stood for 20 years. \"The Sudanese citizens living in the United States are known for their good reputation, respect for American laws, and their lack of involvement in radical and criminal acts,\" the government says. Somalia The government so far doesn't appear to have issued a formal response, but Somali native Mo Farah, a decorated Olympian and British citizen who lives in Portland, Ore., criticized the ban, which he said cast doubt on whether he can return to his family after training in Ethiopia. Farah said via Facebook: \"It's deeply troubling that I will have to tell my children that Daddy might not be able to come home \u2014 to explain why the President has introduced a policy that comes from a place of ignorance and prejudice.\" Hundreds of thousands of Somali refugees live in Kenya. NPR's Eyder Peralta, citing the U.N.'s refugee agency, reports that some 26,000 Somalis in Kenya are undergoing the official process of trying to gain permission to settle in the U.S. Roughly half have already been interviewed by U.S. immigration officials. After Trump's election in November, Somalia congratulated the new president and said it hopes to strengthen relations, saying Somalia's government and people \"enjoy strong bilateral ties with the USA built on mutual respect, trust and partnership.\" Libya We're not seeing an official response from the struggling nation. The ban came weeks before a conference on U.S.-Libya relations is scheduled to be held in Washington, D.C.",

As the Trump administration is expected to overhaul America's immigration system, some policymakers suggest looking north to Canada. That's because Canadians see immigration as critical to their economic success. The nation has invited in so many immigrants that today, one-fifth of the population is foreign-born. Yet Canadians don't seem to wrestle with anti-immigrant nativism that has erupted in the U.S. and Europe. In Toronto, scanning a business directory shows how multicultural the city is: the Association of Bulgarian Engineers, the Canadian Network of Iranian Architects, the Association of Filipino Canadian Accountants. Half the population was born under another flag. \"If you ask me where I'm from, I say I'm from Canada. And if you ask me what's my nationality, I say Jamaica,\" says Michael Thomas. He's a 53-year-old co-owner of the Caribbean Corner, a warm, laid-back grocery in the frigid precincts of downtown Toronto. He arrived in Canada 30 years ago. For him, Toronto's astonishing multicultural character is a global village. \"I love it,\" Thomas says in his island lilt. \"I see the world in one place.\" Canada knows what it wants: high-skilled workers and business entrepreneurs like Thomas. As such, Canada assigns points to prospective newcomers for job skills, education and language proficiency. They don't even call them immigrants. \"In Canada, we do refer to immigrants as 'new Canadians,' \" says Margaret Eaton, executive director of the Toronto Region Immigrant Employment Council. \"Because there is that expectation that they will come here and that they will stay. And our country, unlike others, actually provides a path to citizenship.\" The night Donald Trump won the election, the Canadian immigration website crashed from the crush of panicky U.S. residents and citizens considering relocation. The next day, Rene Berrospi, a Peruvian-born immigration lawyer in Toronto, started getting calls, emails and Facebook messages from immigrants living in the U.S. \"I have a person who contacted me, her husband is black and also Muslim and they want to immigrate here because they see that Canada is more welcoming,\" Berrospi says. \"I know there is the American dream, but people are now thinking in the Canadian dream.\" 'Our identity has never been stronger' Yet Canadian immigration is not based purely on maple-leaf hospitality. This northern colossus \u2014 the second largest country on the globe \u2014 has only 36 million people. Eaton says a low national birthrate creates Canada's immigration imperative. \"We are not replacing ourselves. So we are always relying upon bringing new immigrants into the country, but it even has more urgency now,\" Eaton says. \"If we want to maintain our standard of living, we are going to have to be bringing even larger numbers of immigrants.\" The United States, which admits more legal immigrants than any other country, has a different approach. Here, it's all about family reunification: bringing in spouses, parents, children and siblings who live abroad. But consecutive Congresses have failed to update the immigration program for 27 years. Foreign nationals can wait more than a decade for a green card. The lottery system for worker visas is overburdened. And 11 million unauthorized immigrants live in the shadows. If we want to maintain our standard of living, we are going to have to be bringing even larger numbers of immigrants. Eaton, executive director of the Toronto Region Immigrant Employment Council \"The biggest contrast between the U.S. and Canada,\" says Chris Alexander, Canadian minister of Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship from 2013 to 2015, \"is that we have reformed our immigration system continuously, intensively, for a decade at a time when the U.S. has been facing gridlock.\" Alexander is currently running to lead the Conservative Party. He says Parliament continually tweaks the immigration system because it's a national priority. \"The consensus in Canada that immigration is part of our economic future and that part of our identity has never been stronger,\" he says. About 300,000 permanent immigrants come into Canada every year. That's equivalent to about one percent of its population, one of the highest ratios in the world. Ashot Verdanyan and his wife, Lora Yekhstyan, are the kinds of immigrants Canada prizes. They live in a cozy apartment in a heavily multicultural Toronto suburb. They came over from Armenia as part of the skilled worker program. He teaches English; she's an industrial engineer. These three \"new Canadians,\" as immigrants are called in Canada, have made Toronto their home. They work or own a business at Kensington Market.

(Right) Wynnona Yumol came to Canada from the Philippines with her parents when she was 2 years old. \"We find that the American immigration system hasn't been flexible,\" Ashot says. Before migrating to Canada, they both lived in Iowa for nine years getting advanced degrees. \"The Canadian system is much more flexible in terms of immigration. Canada's system is very organized. We wanted to stay in the United States, but even given our credentials, we were unable to do that, because we were restricted.\" When they arrived in Canada six years ago, Yekhstyan says the government had programs in place to help them transition. \"You don't have any family, you don't have any friends, you don't have anything here in Canada,\" she says \"You can go straight to the newcomer centers, and they will give you support.\" This is not to say every immigrant has a job waiting for them. It's common to find doctors and engineers driving taxis in Canada. Eaton of the Immigrant Employment Council says she hears complaints about employers turning down immigrant job applicants because they lack \"Canadian experience.\" \"And that can become a bit of a code word for 'I didn't like your accent. We didn't think you would fit in,' \" she says. An E pluribus unum shifting north? Some parts of Canada are more welcoming to newcomers than others. \"I don't care what people look like. I don't care if they're black, brown or yellow. It doesn't matter. But don't try to change our culture,\" says John Duggan, an oilfield truck driver who lives in St. Catharines, a town near Niagara Falls. He's digging into an omelet at Angel's Caf\u00e9. Though Duggan himself was brought to Canada as a child from Ireland, he is critical of the pro-immigrant policies of the liberal prime minister, Justin Trudeau. \"I have no problem with people wanting to come here, but ... charity begins at home. I watched Mr. Trudeau giving brand new jackets to [immigrants] coming over,\" he says. \"I have no problem with that. But we have people here freezing and they need the same stuff but they have a hard time getting it.\" One reason there's not more social tension over immigrants is because Canada doesn't struggle with illegal immigration. This nation has fewer than 150,000 unauthorized immigrants. The United States \u2014 with its illegal border crossers and visa over stayers \u2014 has millions. It's partly an accident of geography. \"We are lucky to have the United States. And we have only one land border,\" Alexander says. \"We have Russia to the north of us. We have Danes [and] they're not people swimming in from Greenland.\" These days, Canadians are taken aback when they look south. They see the climate of fear and anger that has broken out in America toward Spanish-speaking and Muslim immigrants. \"Canada has looked at the United States in many ways as an example of a welcoming society,\" says Laura Dawson, director of the Canada Institute at the Woodrow Wilson Center in Washington, D.C. \"And it's disheartening for many Canadians to see the United States be so fearful, to be so xenophobic and not to be more welcoming to other folks in the world.\" Some Canadians wonder if that most American motto \u2014 E pluribus unum \u2014 out of many, one \u2014 has moved north.",

Viridiana Martinez's parents brought her to the U.S. illegally when she was 7. But it wasn't until she was in her 20s, when she took the microphone at a rally in Durham, N.C., that she \"came out\" as being unauthorized herself. Martinez, now 30, has been on the front lines of the immigrant rights movement in North Carolina ever since. She co-founded the North Carolina Dream Team, which advocated for immigrants who were brought to the U.S. illegally by their parents. She was once arrested at a sit-in demonstration in Atlanta, risking being turned over to immigration agents for the sake of protest. A year ago, she helped launch Alerta Migratoria, a hotline that immigrants in North Carolina can call to report the presence of ICE agents in their communities (it forwards calls to her cellphone). In other words, Martinez is just the kind of person you might expect to be terrified by Trump's ascension to the presidency, given his promise to deport millions of immigrants in the country illegally and repeal President Obama's Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, which has granted Martinez and 730,000 young immigrants like her work permits and temporary protection from deportation. And yet, sitting on a futon in her tidy apartment in Raleigh recently, Martinez said she wasn't upset by Trump's victory. In fact, quite the opposite. \"I'm actually happy that Donald Trump won,\" she said. \"I am. I'm very happy, because this is an opportunity to take a new approach at immigrant rights organizing.\" For Martinez and others advocating on behalf of immigrants, this election has surfaced some unexpected opportunities. In the battle over the fates of people in the country illegally, Trump's election may look like a victory for those who would have the federal government expel as many as possible. But people like Martinez are finding that the simple fear of that possibility has given their long-standing efforts a shot in the arm. Viewing Trump as a grave threat to their immigrant communities, many local lawmakers are reacting to his deportation proposals with the kind of defiance that grass-roots advocates have been asking of them for years. \"I mean, sure, it sucks that it took Donald Trump winning,\" Martinez said, \"but it's already moving people to act.\" Viridiana Martinez (right) discusses immigration activism in Durham, N.C., with young people hoping to become more involved in helping immigrants in the country illegally.\n                \n                    \n                    Adrian Florido/NPR\n                    \n                \nhide caption Viridiana Martinez (right) discusses immigration activism in Durham, N.C., with young people hoping to become more involved in helping immigrants in the country illegally. She was referring to reports from across the country of mayors, police chiefs, city council members; dozens of public officials who have vowed to defy Trump should he try to enlist them to deport people. Though the president-elect has scaled back his most sweeping campaign promise to deport all 11 million immigrants in the country illegally, many local officials are taking no chances. \"If the federal government wants our police officers to tear immigrant families apart, we will refuse to do it,\" New York Mayor Bill De Blasio said in a speech days after the November election. In Los Angeles, Mayor Eric Garcetti announced a $10 million fund to provide lawyers for immigrants facing deportation. \"We don't know how far the new administration will go when it comes to our nation's immigration policy,\" he said, \"but we all heard the rhetoric.\" In smaller cities and towns, from Arizona to Iowa to North Carolina, officials have taken a similar tone. This is exciting for grass-roots activists like Martinez. During the past eight years, many efforts to advance immigrant rights in the absence of a federal immigration reform bill were aimed at persuading the Obama administration to act unilaterally through programs like DACA. Now, in anticipation of Trump, the strategy appears to be shifting. Activists say they'll focus on persuading local officials to be more aggressive in protecting immigrants in the country illegally from the federal government. \"In the coming years you're going to see people fighting to establish new civil rights protections in cities by forging new ground with policies that might not have been deemed possible even as recently as two months ago,\" said Chris Newman, legal director for the National Day Laborer Organizing Network, a grass-roots immigrant advocacy group. The public statements many local officials have made in recent weeks, he said, suggest that cities will be receptive to this strategy. Officials in Los Angeles, New York and Chicago have already started acting. For activists like Martinez, there's a tinge of frustration over the fact that it took Trump's election to spur this response. \"Because the reality is, we just came out of a presidency where the administration has deported more immigrants than any other,\" she said. \"And the only reason this is happening now is because our president-elect is Donald Trump.\" It's hard to say for sure whether Obama outdeported all of his predecessors. Interpreting the statistics can be tricky because the government's method for tracking deportations has changed over time. Department of Homeland Security figures indicate the Obama administration will have deported about 3 million people by the time the president leaves office. The George W. Bush administration deported roughly 2 million. Martinez said that for years, she has been watching families get torn apart by Obama's deportation policies. So, while Trump's rhetoric has been alarming, she said she sees little substantive difference between his most recent proposal \u2014 to deport 2 to 3 million immigrants he says have criminal records \u2014 and what Obama has already done. It's like a guy who tells you you're ugly to your face versus a guy who tells you you're pretty, but then turns around and tells his friend, 'Damn, she's ugly!' Immigrant rights advocate Viridiana Martinez \"It's like a guy who tells you you're ugly to your face versus a guy who tells you you're pretty, but then turns around and tells his friend, 'Damn, she's ugly!' \" Martinez said. Martinez said the problem is that for the past eight years, many local officials were convinced by the \"you're pretty\" guy \u2014 Obama, in this case \u2014 and didn't feel the need to take as forceful a stance against his deportations as they now are taking against Trump. \"I think people were conformed, complacent,\" she said, \"and they felt that under a Democratic presidency things could not be bad; that President Obama was a friend of immigrants, even though that was far from the truth.\" Obama, critics like Newman and Martinez say, believed that to gain Republican support for an immigration reform bill that included legalization for millions, he also had to prove he could be tough on enforcement. It was a strategic gambit that failed, Newman said. Obama deported millions while Republicans blocked immigration reform efforts that might have made it possible for immigrants in the country illegally to gain legal status. \"And he was able to, on a certain level, get away with it\" among his allies, Newman said, \"as long as people believed that he was also in favor of something that might not have ever been possible \u2014 namely, comprehensive immigration reform.\" Kevin De Leon, the Democratic leader of the California state Senate, represents a heavily immigrant district in Los Angeles. Earlier this month, he introduced a bill he calls the California Values Act. It would prohibit police departments from devoting resources to enforcing federal immigration laws. Addressing unauthorized immigrants in a statement announcing the bill, De Leon said \"the state of California will be your wall of justice.\" This is the sort of thing activists in California have been asking for for years, through a campaign called \"ICE Out of California.\" The campaign's goal has been to persuade local and state officials to kick Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents out of local jails to make it harder for them to take immigrants into federal custody when they're arrested by local police. Asked to consider the argument that a lot of these new pre-emptive measures should have been put in place years ago, given Obama's deportation record, De Leon said he understands why many activists might feel that way. It's a very pernicious, mean-spirited type of campaigning that we have yet to ever see. And I think that is the major difference. California State Sen. Kevin De Leon \"But this is very different,\" he said. He called Trump's deportation promises during the campaign unprecedented. \"It's a very pernicious, mean-spirited type of campaigning that we have yet to ever see. And I think that is the major difference.\" De Leon said part of what concerns him about Trump is his unpredictability. The president-elect promised so many things, has changed his posture on major issues so many times, that it's impossible to know exactly what he'll do, De Leon said. Because of that, he said, California has to \"prepare for the worst.\" Martinez is skeptical that it will get any worse. Trump is a businessman, she said, and he understands the value of immigrant labor. Still, she said she appreciates the steps officials are taking to enshrine into law protections for immigrants at the local level. She and fellow activists in Durham have a list of proposals they plan to bring to the City Council, which has proved to be immigrant-friendly. Two-thirds of Durham's recent population growth has come from immigration, both legal and illegal. Newman, of the National Day Laborer Organizing Network, said that as justified as many immigrant advocates are in fearing a Trump presidency, there's also reason to believe some good will come of it. In the past, liberal leaders have held out hope for an immigration reform bill, he said. Now they seem to agree that a sensible bill is unlikely under a government controlled by conservatives. \"And the absence of that possibility has in some ways been liberating for local policymakers,\" he said. Now, Newman said, he expects local leaders and activists will start to \"experiment with a range of decentralized tactics\" that will make cities the locus for policies aimed at better treatment of immigrants. \"Legalization from below,\" he called it. In some cities it's already started, with initiatives like the legal defense fund in LA and the refusal by many cities to put their law enforcement officers at the disposal of federal immigration agents. Officials in other cities have said they will look into becoming so-called sanctuary cities, jurisdictions with policies to protect immigrants who are in the country illegally. The city of Santa Ana, Calif., took that step in December. Newman said that activists in other cities are organizing to push their local leaders to follow suit.",

As the American-born child of parents who emigrated from India, comic Hasan Minhaj often feels a little out of place. \"I exist in this hyphen,\" he says. \"I'm an Indian-American-Muslim kid, but am I more Indian or am I more American? What part of my identity am I?\" Those are the kinds of questions Minhaj deliberately sidestepped when was getting his start in comedy. \"It was almost like I was on the playground all over again,\" he says of his early career. \"I just was afraid if I get real ... people aren't going to like it; they're going to think I'm a freak.\" After years doing stand-up, Minhaj became a correspondent with The Daily Show in 2014. The following year, he starred in Homecoming King, a one-man stand-up show in which he began to open up on stage about his experiences as a \"third culture kid\" who doesn't fully share in either the culture of his parents or that of his hometown of Davis, Calif. \"It wasn't until I started exploring the personal stuff, the one-man-show stuff, that I kind of got a chance to be more open to the audience and to my family,\" he says. Minhaj's new stand-up special, which is also called Homecoming King, is available on Netflix starting Tuesday. On his father's strict rules growing up One of the biggest things immigrant kids oftentimes feel is ... this big disparity between our parents and us. And our parents are staunch pragmatists and I consider myself to be an optimist. ... His rules with me growing up were very simple: no fun, no friends, no girlfriends. You can have fun in med school, which is, like, a huge lie. Terry, that's just a blatant lie. All my Indian friends and Asian-American friends that are in medicine or pharmacy, they will tell you: It doesn't get poppin' in dental school. It doesn't all of a sudden get fun where you go to a club and see a bunch of dudes going crazy, like, \"What's going on fellas?\" \"What's going on? Residency! I'm having the time of my life.\" It doesn't work like that! I go back to Aligarh and I go back to Delhi often, where my cousins live now, and I'm very aware of the opportunity that I have when I go meet them. That's where I understand and I empathize with what my dad feels. Hasan Minhaj Again, I felt like for my dad ... I have to deliver the dream. I am aware of that. I go back to Aligarh and I go back to Delhi often, where my cousins live now, and I'm very aware of the opportunity that I have when I go meet them. That's where I understand and I empathize with what my dad feels.  On his mother taking his newborn younger sister to live in India while she finished her residency there My younger sister, Ayesha, was born in the States and then, at 2 months after her birth, she went to go live with my grandparents and be raised [in India]. So I didn't officially, officially get a chance to really meet her until I was 8 [and Ayesha was 5]. The tough thing was, again, a lot of immigrant households, when you come to the States, you don't have the bandwidth and set up to accommodate a lot of things. My dad is working full time; I'm at school and then I'm going to ... an after school daycare program; and now we have a newborn, my little sister. My mom is doing residency and rotations, so she's at a hospital all day. There just wasn't that infrastructure to care for this newborn baby, and financially that wasn't there. My grandparents were in India and it was set up in such a way that she could be raised and she was around cousins and it was an amazing way for her to grow up. Our narratives are very different. She grew up in India. Like, literally, it took a village. She was around people that loved her and were there for her, and I was this brown kid who was alone in America with his dad. So when she came back, I was just like, I hate this person. Who are you? I just wanted a mom, and now I got you. On how doing speech and debate in high school led him to comedy In high school I didn't know what comedy was, but I was involved in speech and debate and public speaking. ... Believe it or not, they are very similar. ... My favorite comedians are just presenting an argument and they're doing it in a funny way. And whenever I would do speech and debate, ... if you can make the judges laugh or if you could ridicule your opponent's position and make the judges laugh, I always would do better on the scorecard. ... That's when I really wanted to get into political comedy and talk about a lot of these topics that sometimes would be too taboo to talk about in other settings. On how getting a job at The Daily Show with Jon Stewart marked a turning point in how his parents viewed his career They finally could believe that I would be OK because ... Jon, to my dad, was somebody that you could trust and he was somebody that had figured things out. ... He was like, \"If Jon Stewart says you're alright, then I think you'll be OK.\" Just having that co-sign \u2014 more than having steady income and getting to have your dream job \u2014 having that co-sign with your parents was just a huge deal. On election night and trying to get his mom home from a visit to India once it became clear Trump was going to win We were doing a live show that night; it was our election night special. We had a script written that followed what we thought was going to happen, that Hillary Clinton would be president. [But] as ... the results were coming in, we're literally tearing apart our script. We're rewriting a one-hour live show in real time, and I'm on WhatsApp audio with my mom. My mom [is] being like, \"We're watching the news. I'm with your grandma. What's going on?\" So I'm trying to write jokes about Trump winning the election while I'm on Kayak.com looking up tickets for her to come back. ... It was a horrible 48 hours. ... And not knowing that everything will be OK was just really awful. ... We managed to get her home. ... I didn't want to risk anything. On hosting the 2017 White House Correspondents' Dinner and being asked not to roast President Trump The irony to me was the theme of the night was about honoring the First Amendment, and you want me to censor myself? That to me \u2014 I couldn't do it. ... Especially given the fact that the person that I'm roasting, the president, is someone who has so exploited that incredible privilege of free speech. The man who tweets whatever enters his head doesn't even want to honor the amendment that allows him to do it. That to me just blows my mind. So I wanted to make the conscious choice of, Hey, I will roast his merit and I will roast the decisions he's made. I will try to be as tasteful as possible, but I have to talk about this.

Right after the U.S. election last year, Mike Tippett saw an opportunity. He'd been talking to his friends in Silicon Valley and they were nervous about the newly elected president's attitude toward immigration. \"Many of the start-ups and technology companies in the States and across the globe are made up of people who are not necessarily from that country,\" Tippett says. Almost half of all American start-ups were actually founded by immigrants. When Donald Trump took office, American tech companies worried that getting international employees work visas in the U.S. would get a lot harder. But Tippett had a solution to offer them: move to Vancouver. Vancouver's tech industry has been growing for years now, with companies like Amazon, Slack, Microsoft and SAP all with large headquarters there. It's a quick flight from San Francisco, and a two-hour drive from Seattle. It's in the same time zone with the same language. Labor is also cheaper. Tippett predicted there would be a surge of tech workers looking for an alternative to America. He founded the company True North, which helps tech workers move to Canada, get incorporated, deal with all the tax and other legal and immigration issues. \"We say, come on up! It's a great opportunity for Vancouver and Canada generally,\" he says, laughing. Tippett says Silicon Valley is still the place to be. But each high-skilled worker who moves to Canada is America's loss. \"America used to be this place where you could go and have some assurances that you could live the American dream, you can be successful, you're not going to get kicked out, and it was a safe place to be,\" he says. \"I think that notion has been largely shattered. Whereas Canada has gone the other direction and said, 'We are that place, and you can come here; you're not gonna kicked out.' \" Alex Modon heard that message. Two team members at his small Silicon Valley start-up are from India. They were in the U.S. on tourist visas initially, but Modon hired a lawyer to get them U.S. work visas. The months dragged on and the bills racked up. After spending tens of thousands of dollars, his Indian co-workers didn't get permission to stay in the country. The H1B visas that Modon's team applied for have always been restricted. Only a limited number are handed out each year. And Modon says he never thought it was going to get any easier under the Trump administration. So his team hired True North to help his co-founders move to Vancouver \u2014 they got work permits in a matter of weeks. \"We're probably a pretty good example of folks that will end up building a piece of our company and in another country. Not because that's the first choice, but because that's the necessary choice,\" Modon says. Silicon Vancouver? Canada is now aggressively marketing itself as an alternative to Silicon Valley. This past summer, the Canadian government launched a program that streamlines the immigration process for tech workers. Ray Walia co-founded Launch Academy and works with the Canadian government to help attract tech companies to Canada. He says even American companies are interested.\n                \n                    \n                    Ian Stewart/NPR\n                    \n                \nhide caption Ray Walia co-founded Launch Academy and works with the Canadian government to help attract tech companies to Canada. He says even American companies are interested. At a start-up incubator in Vancouver called Launch Academy, young people in hoodies are hunched over their laptops. Launch Academy co-founder Ray Walia is showing us around. He works with the Canadian government on a start-up visa program meant to target and vet budding companies from around the world. Visas can be obtained within two to four weeks after approval. Walia recently went to India to sell Canada as a place to come and build a company. He says he's seen a lot of interest \u2014 even from the U.S. He estimates that 30-40 percent of the companies who've applied for the start-up visa are American. Migrants can't \"just show up\" But it's not just highly skilled workers who are taking Canada at its word that it's friendly to immigrants. The message has had some unintended consequences. This year, more than 15,000 people have illegally crossed the border from the U.S. to Canada. International Social Service is a nonprofit that helps immigrants and refugees settle in Canada. Mona Hassennia is one of the center's directors. She says 80 percent of her clients have walked over the border from the United States into Canada. Mona Hassennia says some clients feel invited to illegally come to Canada.\n                \n                    \n                    Ravenna Koenig/NPR\n                    \n                \nhide caption Mona Hassennia says some clients feel invited to illegally come to Canada. \"I think the biggest reason that they're coming is the safety issue. They don't feel that there is safety in the United States, she says. She recounts the story of one of her clients who told her that they came to Vancouver because they were invited. \"And we're kind of all looking at each other like, who invited you? And she said, 'Well, the prime minister of Canada,' \" says Hassennia. After President Trump launched his travel ban, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau made a point of accepting a number of Syrian refugees, and tweeting \"#WelcomeToCanada.\" Hassennia says many refugees in the United States have taken up the implicit offer. Ahmed Hussen is Canada's Minister of immigration, refugees and citizenship, who was a refugee himself. He came to Canada from Somalia as a teenager. He says the government is trying to counter the impression that Canada has an open border. \"If you are just coming because you want a better life and a better opportunity, then you have to apply,\" he says. Just crossing the border is \"illegal and potentially dangerous.\" \"There is a lot of misinformation to certain communities in the United States who were given the wrong impression about Canada,\" Hussen says. The government is trying to \"correct the record\" with diaspora communities in American cities. \"Look, you are welcome to Canada,\" he says, \"but it doesn't mean you can just show up because of your perception of what Canada is about.\" Illegal crossings were down in September. But the influx of people fleeing America has still provoked a backlash in Canada. A recent poll found that just over half of Canadians think their government is being \"too generous\" to asylum seekers.

            "article_content": "From his early endorsement of then-candidate Trump February 2016, through his time so far as Attorney General, Jeff Sessions has been one of the most loyal supporters of Trump and his populist agenda.  KELLY MCEVERS, HOST: The relationship between President Trump and his attorney general, Jeff Sessions, is not getting any better. In an interview with The New York Times, yesterday during a news conference in the Rose Garden and over and over this week on Twitter, the president has been openly criticizing Sessions for recusing himself from the Russia investigation and for, in Trump's view, going too easy on Hillary Clinton and government leakers. And all that criticism comes in stark contrast to what once appeared to be a close relationship. Jeff Sessions has been by Donald Trump's side almost since the beginning of his run for president. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) JEFF SESSIONS: At this time in Americans' history, we need to make America great again. MCEVERS: It's February 2016. It's just a couple days ahead of Super Tuesday. The Republican primary is still wide open. And Jeff Sessions becomes one of the first members of Congress to endorse Donald Trump. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) SESSIONS: I am pleased to endorse Donald Trump for the presidency of the United States. MCEVERS: NPR justice correspondent Carrie Johnson, welcome. CARRIE JOHNSON, BYLINE: Thanks, Kelly. MCEVERS: When Jeff Sessions endorsed candidate Donald Trump, why was that significant? JOHNSON: Well, Donald Trump had been considered a profoundly antiestablishment choice. And I guess he still is. But he did need support from somebody in Washington, and Jeff Sessions, it turns out, was that man. Jeff Sessions has a long record here in D.C. as a member of Congress. And he had cultivated a base of support tough on immigration, tough on crime that had carried with him over the years and carried to Donald Trump in Trump's campaign. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) SESSIONS: Listen, this is a historic election. If we don't fix the immigration broken system now, it will not be fixed. This may be our last chance. MCEVERS: And then after Trump is elected, he nominates Sessions to be attorney general. It's one of his earliest nominations. It's just a few days after the election. Talk about that. JOHNSON: Widely considered a reward for Jeff Sessions' unstinting loyalty to Donald Trump. At the time, Trump said Sessions was a world-class legal mind and pointed out Sessions had served as attorney general for the state of Alabama and a U.S. attorney, the top federal prosecutor, in the state of Alabama, said he could think of no one better to serve as his U.S. attorney general. Sessions, for his part, said the Justice Department was his home in some ways, and the attorney general post would be likely the best job he would ever have in his career. That's saying something. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: It is with great pride, very great pride that I say these words to you right now - Attorney General Jeff Sessions. (APPLAUSE) TRUMP: Welcome to the White House. MCEVERS: So as attorney general, has Jeff Sessions been able to carry out this vision that he and Trump laid out on the campaign trail? What has he been able to accomplish? JOHNSON: Yeah. And you can make an argument - and I think I would - that Jeff Sessions more than any other Cabinet member has had a real-time impact on the office he holds, on the Justice Department. He's reprioritized crime and drugs on the Justice Department's agenda. He talks about them in nearly every public appearance. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) SESSIONS: I do not believe - and maybe I'm wrong, but I do not believe that this pop in crime is necessarily an aberration. JOHNSON: He's talked about immigration. In fact, he's gone to the border more than once to speak about his priorities. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) SESSIONS: This is a new era. This is the Trump era. The lawlessness, the abdication of duty to enforce our laws and the catch-and-release policies of the past are over. JOHNSON: He talks about targeting sanctuary cities, places that don't cooperate as often with federal immigration authorities. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) SESSIONS: Sanctuary cities are aiding these cartels to refill their ranks... JOHNSON: And also, of course, resetting the relationship with local police departments. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) SESSIONS: Help police departments get better, not diminish their effectiveness. JOHNSON: Remember, the Obama administration investigated more than two dozen of them. Jeff Sessions doesn't want to do these investigations. He wants to be their partners. MCEVERS: And then comes this pivotal moment - right? - March 2. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) SESSIONS: Let me share a few thoughts... MCEVERS: After The Washington Post reports that Jeff Sessions met with the Russian ambassador during the campaign despite saying in confirmation hearings that he had not met with the Russians. And Jeff Sessions recuses himself from the Russian investigation. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) SESSIONS: I have now decided to recuse myself from any existing or future investigations of any matter relating in any way to the campaigns for president of the United States. MCEVERS: This, now we know, is a major turning point for President Trump. Why is it only now, do you think, that President Trump is talking about how upset he was with Jeff Sessions doing that back in March? JOHNSON: Well, based on the people I've been speaking with for some weeks now, President Trump's anger rolls like a stone down the mountain. So the anger has been building over time. And in fact, he was yelling at Jeff Sessions both in person and over the phone in sometimes profane conversations about Sessions' decision to recuse himself. But that only broke into public view rather recently. (SOUNDBITE OF INTERVIEW) TRUMP: Sessions should never recused himself. And... MCEVERS: This is an interview the president did last week with The New York Times. (SOUNDBITE OF INTERVIEW) TRUMP: If he would have recused himself before the job I would have said, thanks, Jeff, but I can't - you know, I'm not going to take you. It's extremely unfair - and that's a mild word - to the president. MCEVERS: I just want to be clear here. The president has criticized Sessions a lot lately, even this morning on Twitter, but Sessions still has the job and says he will continue as long as it's appropriate. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) SESSIONS: I have the honor of serving as attorney general. It's something that goes beyond any thought I would have ever had for myself. We love this job. We love this department. And I plan to continue to do so as long as that is appropriate. MCEVERS: But if he is fired ultimately by the president, what happens then? JOHNSON: Well, one of the reasons some analysts in and outside the Justice Department are saying President Trump hasn't fired Jeff Sessions already is that he can't find the right person to replace Jeff Sessions at the Justice Department. And in fact, would somebody want to step down from a federal judgeship, a very safe job in the private sector, to come into this environment where the president is berating you in public, on Twitter, in press conferences and interviews with reporters? That's a tough sell for this post right now. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN: So I'm wondering if you would talk to us a little bit about whether you've lost confidence in Jeff Sessions, why you're sort of letting him twist in the wind rather than just making the call for him. Thank you. TRUMP: Well, I don't think I am doing that. But I am disappointed in the attorney general. He should not have recused himself. MCEVERS: So let's say Jeff Sessions does stay in the job. Does this tension between him and the president hinder his ability to carry out these priorities that he so clearly laid out from the beginning? JOHNSON: Well, let's be honest, morale at the highest levels of the Justice Department is poor, to put it mildly. People are very distracted by this onslaught of criticism from the president every morning, every night. That said, Jeff Sessions is trying to forge ahead with his agenda. Just yesterday he put out some new guidance on federal grants for law enforcement agencies and folks who cooperate with federal immigration authorities. And we're hearing out of the Justice Department this week that sometime in the next seven to 10 days DOJ is going to announce a new policy or strategy toward leak investigations, something that has animated Donald Trump and angered him throughout his entire tenure as president so far. MCEVERS: NPR justice correspondent Carrie Johnson. Thanks a lot. JOHNSON: You're welcome. (SOUNDBITE OF KONG'S \"BONOBO\") Copyright \u00a9 2017 NPR.  All rights reserved.

(SOUNDBITE OF SIREN) DAVID GREENE, HOST: That's the of emergency vehicles outside the Louvre in Paris this morning. The museum was put on lockdown for a short time after a man attacked a guard at one of the entrances to the complex. The man was shot by another guard. French anti-terror prosecutors are now investigating. And let's turn to NPR's Eleanor Beardsley in Paris and, Eleanor, what happened here? ELEANOR BEARDSLEY, BYLINE: Well, this morning, police say a man attacked one of the soldiers on guard - he was part of a patrol - with a machete at the entrance to a very upscale shopping mall that leads to the Louvre. He slightly wounded him. Another soldier fired five shots at the attacker who is wounded now but conscious. GREENE: And why are anti-terror prosecutors getting involved here so early? BEARDSLEY: Well, David, witnesses say that the man shouted God is great in Arabic as he attacked the soldier. Beyond that, very little is known. We don't know who this man was or his nationality. Police say he did have a suitcase with him and, you know, he attacked - and a backpack. And he attacked the soldier after being told he couldn't enter the mall with his bags. Now, I went out to the Louvre. It was on lockdown. People - it was cleared out. And people say now - they say now that there was no explosives in his bag and it's been reopened - second man's been arrested. GREENE: OK. So the museum reopened, sort of getting back to normal maybe. But this is a city, Eleanor, that really has never gotten back to normal because of all the recent terrible attacks in the past two years. BEARDSLEY: Yeah, David, you're right, and there are these, you know, soldiers and patrols all over Paris, especially at somewhere like the Louvre, which is one of the most visited sites in France. The prime minister spoke today, and he reminded people that the country is still on high alert. But this is kind of hard to remember sometimes, David, because you go back to your normal life and France has been on high alert for a year now. But, you know, there is a presidential election coming up in three months. Immigration and security are huge issues. And today was just a reminder that this is the new normal in France, and especially Paris, I'd say. GREENE: OK, talking to NPR's Eleanor Beardsley where there was an attack this morning at the Louvre, the famous museum, in the city. Eleanor, thanks so much. BEARDSLEY: Thank you, David.

            "article_content": "Lawyers and judges in some parts of the country say that for the first time Immigration and Customs Enforcement Agents are coming inside courthouses to question people about their immigration status.  STEVE INSKEEP, HOST: Lawyers and judges in some parts of this country are noticing a trend. They say agents from Immigration and Customs Enforcement, or ICE, are coming inside courthouses. The ICE agents find people appearing in court and ask about their immigration status. And they're making arrests. Though ICE says this is nothing new, it raises concerns about who has access to the justice system. Oregon Public Broadcasting's Conrad Wilson reports. CONRAD WILSON, BYLINE: Attorneys in Multnomah County, which includes the city of Portland, say they only began seeing and getting reports of ICE agents inside the county's courthouses around mid-December. People, regardless of immigration status, come to courthouses to pay fines, file restraining orders, serve as witnesses and file lawsuits. EDWARD JONES: When people don't get paid, they have a right to sue their employer for the wages they didn't get. WILSON: Edward Jones is the chief criminal judge for Multnomah County. He says in those cases, the law is clear. A person's immigration status doesn't matter. JONES: Every day there's a story about somebody getting arrested in the courthouse on an immigration issue. You can be sure there are people who didn't get paid who will think twice about filing that claim to recover their wages. WILSON: In mid-February, Whitney Leeds walked up to three men inside the main courthouse in Denver, Colo. Leeds is a criminal defense and immigration attorney. And she asked the men if they were ICE agents. (SOUNDBITE OF VIDEO) WHITNEY LEEDS: I'm Whitney. Nice to meet you. UNIDENTIFIED MAN: Nice to meet you. LEEDS: Are you here with Immigration Enforcement? UNIDENTIFIED MAN: Yes. LEEDS: You are here. OK. Are you coming here to make an arrest? UNIDENTIFIED MAN: Yes. WILSON: It's a little hard to hear, but in the video posted online, one of the men tells Leeds yes, they're ICE agents. And they're planning to make an arrest. Leeds says in Denver, ICE made arrests at courthouses during the Obama administration. LEEDS: I've had several instances where my clients have been arrested by ICE right outside of the courtroom in the hallway. WILSON: During his presidency, Obama deported more than two and a half million people, the most of any president. Leeds says since the election, she expects more immigration arrests and more fear around the courthouse. LEEDS: First because Trump's executive orders call for thousands of additional ICE agents to be hired. And secondly because he has prioritized for deportation not only any person who is here without lawful status but also any person who's ever been arrested for a crime. WILSON: So far this year, ICE has made at least two arrests at courthouses in Southern California. In February, ICE arrested a woman in El Paso, Texas, who was filing a restraining order against her allegedly abusive boyfriend. And in January, the agency confirmed they arrested five people at or near courthouses in Portland, Ore. ICE declined a recorded interview, but says those arrested had criminal records. In emails, an ICE spokeswoman says the agency's operating under routine long-standing policies. She says since the people they're trying to find sometimes provide false addresses, arrests at courthouses are often the only option. ANDREA WILLIAMS: We always knew that ICE was hanging outside of the county courthouse. But the fact that they were inside marked a difference and a different level of aggression than we had seen before. WILSON: Andrea Williams is the director of Causa, a Latino immigrant rights organization in Oregon. WILLIAMS: People are afraid of physically going to the courthouse regardless of what their case is. WILSON: Those fears, Williams says, are only sharpened by new reports of ICE arresting people without criminal records. WILLIAMS: How else do our courts function if those that are involved in the cases don't show up? It's a complete breakdown of our judicial system. WILSON: Local leaders in Oregon want the Department of Homeland Security to consider courthouses like hospitals, places of worship and other sensitive areas ICE avoids when making immigration arrests. Currently, those sensitive locations don't include courthouses. For NPR News, I'm Conrad Wilson in Portland. Copyright \u00a9 2017 NPR.  All rights reserved.

            "article_content": "Donald Trump was elected president on a promise to reverse many of the policies of his predecessor, Barack Obama. A year later, NPR takes stock of what's changed under President Trump and what hasn't.  KELLY MCEVERS, HOST: A lot has changed in the year since Donald Trump was elected president, but some things remain pretty much the same. As we mark the first anniversary of that election, NPR's Scott Horsley looks at the impact Trump has had on Washington policymaking and at the policies that remain stubbornly resistant to change. SCOTT HORSLEY, BYLINE: During the presidential campaign, Donald Trump often promised to bring big change to Washington almost overnight. (SOUNDBITE OF MONTAGE) PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: We're going to rescind all the job-destroying Obama executive actions. We're going to cancel the Paris climate agreement. When we win on November 8... (CHEERING) TRUMP: ...And elect a Republican Congress, we will be able to immediately repeal and replace Obamacare - have to do it. HORSLEY: OK. We know that last one turned out to be a little more complicated than the president expected. Change in Washington often comes slowly - just ask former President Obama. Despite his dire warnings during the campaign about what a Trump victory would mean, Obama told The New Yorker shortly after the election he expected much of his legacy would survive. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) BARACK OBAMA: You know, the federal government and our democracy is not a speedboat. It's an ocean liner. HORSLEY: Obamacare is not the only piece of the last president's agenda that's proven hard for Trump to undo. Although Trump announced with considerable fanfare his intent to withdraw from the Paris climate agreement, that turns out to be a multiyear-long process. Even Trump's selection of a new Federal Reserve chairman last week was mostly a signal of continuity. JASON FURMAN: To date, there has been more expectation of policy change than actual tangible policy change. HORSLEY: Jason Furman was an economic adviser in the Obama White House. Some Trump efforts have run into legal roadblocks, like the proposed ban on transgender service members. In other important ways, though, Trump has begun leaving his mark. Senior Vice President Neil Bradley of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce says Trump has led the biggest rollback of regulations since Ronald Reagan, a move that's been welcomed by many of the chamber's members. NEIL BRADLEY: They feel like the threat of overregulation has subsided. They have breathing room to focus on the fundamentals of their business. And that's completely generated kind of this sense of optimism about the future and their ability to grow their businesses. HORSLEY: Immigration is another area where the election's had big consequences. Trump has slashed the number of refugees the U.S. takes in. Deportations from the nation's interior have jumped 34 percent since Trump took office. John Malcolm of The Heritage Foundation says immigration officers are now casting a much wider net. JOHN MALCOLM: There is no question that President Trump ran on a get tough on immigration stance. And I think you're already seeing that in terms of the number of deportations, and also the number of people who are attempting to enter our country. HORSLEY: Trump's EPA has also begun the lengthy process of lifting restrictions on greenhouse gases from power plants. Kate Larsen, who monitors carbon pollution for the Rhodium Group, says that move won't be felt right away, but it will make a difference 5 or 10 years from now. KATE LARSEN: We're seeing continued emission reductions over the next few years because a lot of those investments have been made, but the long-term signals are really dismaying. HORSLEY: Trump has also rattled foreign policy circles with provocative rhetoric, calling the Iran nuclear deal an embarrassment, for example, and threatening to pull out of the North American Free Trade Agreement. Congress and his own advisers have tried to sand off some of the president's rougher edges, but the rest of the world has taken notice. Derek Chollet of the German Marshall Fund says if Trump follows through on a narrowly defined America-first agenda, other countries will go their own way. DEREK CHOLLET: What you're seeing, I think, is the accelerator being pushed down on the post-American world. HORSLEY: During the president's Asia trip, for example, other countries will relaunch their effort to forge an Asia-Pacific trade pact minus the United States. Meanwhile, one of the biggest changes on the president's drawing board is the tax overhaul. That measure could have a dramatic effect on business, government coffers, the federal deficit and income inequality if it makes it through Congress. Trump has an ambitious timetable for the tax plan, hoping to sign it by the end of the year. But even if the ship of state moves more like Obama's ocean liner than a speedboat, Captain Trump is determined to chart a very different course. Scott Horsley, NPR News. Copyright \u00a9 2017 NPR.

            "article_content": "President Trump threw his support Wednesday behind a Senate proposal to reduce legal immigration.  ARI SHAPIRO, HOST: Every year, the United States welcomes about a million new immigrants, issuing green cards that grant permanent resident status. President Trump wants to cut that number in half. He threw his support today behind a controversial bill that would dramatically reduce legal immigration to the U.S. while also changing the criteria for deciding who is allowed in. NPR's Scott Horsley has our report. SCOTT HORSLEY, BYLINE: Trump is calling for the most significant shakeup in U.S. immigration policy in more than half a century. Along with his crackdown on illegal border crossings, the president wants to curb the flow of legal immigration while also making permanent a cap on refugees. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: This legislation demonstrates our compassion for struggling American families who deserve an immigration system that puts their needs first and that puts America first. HORSLEY: The bill would cut by half the number of green cards issued each year. And rather than giving priority to extended family members like the current system, immigrants with advanced education or other qualifications would go to the head of the line. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) TRUMP: This competitive application process will favor applicants who can speak English, financially support themselves and their families and demonstrate skills that will contribute to our economy. HORSLEY: Trump was flanked in the White House Roosevelt Room by Republican Senators Tom Cotton of Arkansas and David Perdue of Georgia, who wrote the proposal. Cotton says the existing immigration system has opened the door to too many low-skilled workers, creating unwelcome competition for native-born Americans, especially those with a high school degree or less. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) TOM COTTON: It puts great downward pressure on people who work with their hands and work on their feet. Now, for some people, they may think that that's a symbol of America's virtue and generosity. I think it's a symbol that we're not committed to working-class Americans. HORSLEY: Cotton and Perdue say their plan is modeled on skills-based immigration systems in Canada and Australia. The plan has already drawn criticism from some of their fellow Republicans and has little chance of passing but is likely to be popular with many Trump voters. Political analyst Bill Galston of the Brookings Institution suspects many blue-collar voters who backed Trump last year did so largely out of concern with a growing immigrant population. BILL GALSTON: I think the evidence will probably sustain the conclusion that immigration was the single most influential issue in the 2016 presidential election. HORSLEY: Galston is skeptical that curbing immigration would automatically boost wages for native-born workers. But he says Trump successfully tapped into a cultural anxiety that many of those workers feel. Galston, who worked in the Clinton White House, says Democrats and other critics of the immigration crackdown ignore those feelings at their peril. GALSTON: In democratic countries, popular sentiments are facts that need to be reckoned with by leaders. And if we think that this is simply an economic issue, then we're going to be blindsided over and over again. HORSLEY: The president's support for the bill represents a victory for the ethnonationalist wing in the White House led by advisers Steve Bannon and Stephen Miller. At a testy press briefing this afternoon, CNN's Jim Acosta challenged Miller to reconcile the bill's preference for English-speaking immigrants with a promise at the base of the Statue of Liberty. (SOUNDBITE OF PRESS CONFERENCE) JIM ACOSTA: Are we just going to bring in people from Great Britain and Australia? STEPHEN MILLER: That is one of the most outrageous, insulting, ignorant and foolish things you've ever said. The notion that you think that this is a racist bill is so wrong and so insulting. The reality is - is that the foreign-born population into our country has quadrupled since 1970. HORSLEY: That's true, but as historian Erika Lee of the University of Minnesota points out, 1970 was hardly a typical year. ERIKA LEE: Some lawmakers consider that a historic norm. It is actually a period that is exceptional in our nation of immigration. HORSLEY: After a half century of restrictive immigration policies, less than 5 percent of the U.S. population was foreign-born in 1970. Today, that figure is closer to 15 percent, about what it was when the Statue of Liberty opened in 1886. Scott Horsley, NPR News, the White House. Copyright \u00a9 2017 NPR.  All rights reserved.

            "article_content": "The arrest and detention of a MIT janitor who is in the country illegally is pulling Gov. Baker into the debate. The GOP governor is trying to stake middle ground in his Democratic-leaning state.  RACHEL MARTIN, HOST: In Massachusetts, the detention of an MIT janitor has Governor Charlie Baker in a kind of bind. The janitor is in the U.S. illegally, and his arrest comes as a result of the increased enforcement of President Trump's tough new immigration policy. Shannon Dooling of member station WBUR reports that Baker is a first-term Republican walking a tightrope in his Democratic-leaning state. SHANNON DOOLING, BYLINE: The president says he's focused on deporting violent criminals and gang members, but there's also been an uptick in noncriminals arrested by federal immigration agents, people like 43-year-old Francisco Rodriguez. FRANCISCO RODRIGUEZ: I'm focused on doing work and support for my family. I'm follow all the rules from the government, try to live, I would say, the American dream. I don't know. Now, it's a nightmare dream - something like that. DOOLING: Rodriguez has been in federal custody for a month facing deportation. The MIT janitor is from El Salvador and is the father of three U.S.-born children. He entered the U.S. without authorization, but has been living in Massachusetts for 10 years. For much of that time, he wasn't at all a priority for deportation - until now. His story is getting the attention of the state's two Democratic U.S. senators, Elizabeth Warren and Edward Markey. Both are calling for his release. Republican Governor Charlie Baker is taking a more measured stance. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) CHARLIE BAKER: I think the important issue for ICE is to focus on convicted and charged criminals. Based on what I've read, I don't think this gentleman meets that criteria. DOOLING: A spokesperson for Baker says his office has conveyed the governor's concerns to federal immigration officials. But Baker has stopped short of asking for Rodriguez's release, and that probably shouldn't come as a surprise. JEFF BERRY: Governor Baker is walking a tightrope on the immigration issue. DOOLING: Jeff Berry is a professor of political science at Tufts University. BERRY: He may even want to keep his fingers in national Republican Party politics. And the immigration story fits into that narrative. DOOLING: A narrative that Baker, as a conservative at the helm of a liberal state, is continually trying to balance. (SOUNDBITE OF PROTEST) UNIDENTIFIED PROTESTER: (Chanting) Hey, hey, ho, ho. Charlie Baker has got to go. UNIDENTIFIED PROTESTERS: (Chanting) Hey, hey, ho, ho, Charlie Baker has got to go. DOOLING: Protesters recorded by the news site MassLive recently spoke out when Baker waded into the national immigration conversation in a big way. A week or so after voicing concerns over Francisco Rodriguez's arrest, Baker filed new legislation that would allow state and local police to cooperate with federal immigration officials in the case of dangerous convicted criminals. Richard Tisei, a former Massachusetts Republican Senate minority leader, says that carefully crafted legislation, paired with Baker's comments on the Rodriguez case, shows Baker just doesn't really operate along traditional party lines. RICHARD TISEI: I know a lot of Republicans who are upset with him right now on his immigration stance. And I know that there are a lot of left-wing organizations, too. And to me, that tells me that he's doing something right and looking at things in a nonpartisan manner. DOOLING: And while Baker hopes to follow his moderate playbook all the way to re-election in 2018, the fierce debate over immigration could prove to be an all-or-nothing issue.

Indeed, Germans have gone to the polls, and they have elected Chancellor Angela Merkel to her fourth term in office. So in many ways this election was about stability, about staying the course, with one glaring exception. For the first time in 60 years, a right-wing political party will sit in Germany's Parliament.

We - we think we have seen an earthquake today, political earthquake in Germany. MARTIN: That's Georg Pazderski. He's the chair of the AfD Party here in Berlin, and I spoke to him last night not far from where we're broadcasting right now, right next to the Brandenburg Gate. PAZDERSKI: In my opinion, we will have a huge impact because for the first time a real opposition party will join the Bundestag after a lot of years. We will name problems we have in Germany. It's a euro crisis, it's EU crisis, it's a migration crisis. And we will manage that Ms. Merkel has to answer the questions and that she has to do something. We will drive her.

SORAYA SARHADDI NELSON, BYLINE: Good morning, Rachel. MARTIN: So we heard the AfD Berlin Party chair there describing this as a political earthquake. Is it? SARHADDI NELSON: Well, it certainly shook things up. I mean, the AfD did siphon-off voters from Chancellor Merkel's conservative base, which had its worst showing in a federal election since 1949. And she and other mainstream politicians are now at each other's throats to try and reconnect with this German electorate that they feel have - that they've lost, that's apparently shifted to the right. But it's also to remember that exit polls show that this was largely a protest vote and that the AfD support could evaporate pretty quickly. MARTIN: How has Merkel responded to the rise of the AfD now that they're in Parliament, have secured this foothold? SARHADDI NELSON: Well, she has acknowledged that this is a very bittersweet victory, that she will be basically going after them with hard facts in - in harsh confrontations. And the AfD has been basically telling her bring it on. So it's going to be quite nasty, I think, at times in Parliament. MARTIN: All right. We're going to bring in another voice into the conversation. She is Kubra Gumusay. She is a writer based in Hamburg, Germany. Her grandparents immigrated to Germany with a wave of Turkish workers in the 1960s. Kubra, thank you so much for being with us. KUBRA GUMUSAY: Thank you for having me. MARTIN: What's your reaction to the election results? GUMUSAY: Well, at first, we total expected the AfD to get into the Parliament, and also the number was not surprising. What was actually shocking and scary was the way the AfD politicians have been talking after their results were declared, and you could just see there was so much pride and so much anger as well. And the way they said that they will chase them, they will chase them and they will take the people back. The rhetoric basically just showed that what we're going to experience in the next four years is going to be worse than what we have been experiencing the last couple of months where the right-wing rhetoric basically dominated the mainstream narrative. MARTIN: So what concerns you most? When you talk about things will get worse in the next four years, what is your concern? GUMUSAY: Well, I think that many people will feel legitimized to actually also be violent on the streets because when - words have huge or immediate impact on the actions of people, and that is one fear I have. MARTIN: You're talking about people who've been vocal against immigration, in particular, from Islamic countries. GUMUSAY: And we also have seen a rise in how people have been attacked on the streets, and I think that might actually be another development that we have to have an eye on. But what also concerns me is all the other topics that basically will not be discussed now, and... MARTIN: Like what? GUMUSAY: For instance, how - for instance, education but also welfare. All of these topics are tangible to people, and they have immediate impact on their lives. But the right-wing populists have shaped our mainstream narrative in a way that we've only been talking about immigration, Islam, refugees. Seventy percent what has been discussed in the TV debate between Schulz and Merkel... MARTIN: Schulz was the frontrunner for the SPD. GUMUSAY: And Merkel the chancellor - basically was about these topics, completely neglecting all of the other topics that are important to us. MARTIN: Well, let me ask you. You say that the AfD is one in that they have - they have shaped, they have framed this - this election and - and the debate of immigration. They say specifically - and I want to ask you about this - Muslims belong to Germany, Islam does not. How do you interpret that? GUMUSAY: Well, this debate has been going on for many years, and I find it very destructive to even pose that question. Why would you question the belonging of a religion to a geographical space? And basically this shows that these destructive debates have basically shaped how we have been discussing immigrants in our country, how we've been discussing Muslims in our country and just the diversity. And responding to a question like does Islam belong to Germany, well, the answer could be no is destructive... MARTIN: You think by bringing up the question... GUMUSAY: Yes. MARTIN: ...It causes more danger. GUMUSAY: We legitimize these questions by responding to them. And right-wing populists have been very effective in provoking the rest of the country and having all of us being appalled and then having all of these lengthy debates about their questions rather than actually posing our own agenda and talking about the topics that shape our lives and are important to us. MARTIN: Kubra Gumusay is a blogger and a writer from Hamburg. She joined us here in our studios in Berlin talking about the election results here in Germany, where the AfD, the right-wing party, has secured enough votes to have a seat in Parliament, the first time a right-wing party will have achieved that in German history in the last 60 years.

Democrat Ralph Northam has easily won the Virginia governor's race, defeating Republican Ed Gillespie in a stinging rebuke to President Trump. Loading... The surprisingly early call in what was expected to be a much closer contest portended a very good night for Democrats in the Old Dominion and across the country. And one year after the 2016 presidential contest, Democrats finally got a signature victory after long boasting of rising opposition to Trump that hadn't paid off with wins in other high-profile races this year. Polls in the final days had predicted a close race in Virginia, but ultimately Northam, the incumbent lieutenant governor, successfully rode an anti-Trump wave to victory over Gillespie's hard-line message on immigration and social issues. With nearly all votes in, Northam was besting Gillespie by about 9 points, higher than Hillary Clinton's 5-point win just last November. Virginia Democrats also elected Justin Fairfax as lieutenant governor \u2014 just the second African-American elected to statewide office since Reconstruction \u2014 and re-elected Mark Herring as attorney general. Trump quickly weighed in via Twitter, arguing Gillespie lost because he hadn't embraced him enough. Trump didn't campaign in person for Gillespie, though he did tweet out support for him and recorded a robocall saying the Republican candidate would help \"make America great again.\" Ed Gillespie worked hard but did not embrace me or what I stand for. Don\u2019t forget, Republicans won 4 out of 4 House seats, and with the economy doing record numbers, we will continue to win, even bigger than before! The backlash to Trump wasn't limited just to the Virginia governor's mansion, however. Democrats are are poised to make major gains in the Virginia House of Delegates as well, including electing the country's first openly transgender state lawmaker, and with several races still too close to call control of the chamber could still switch hands. Democrat Danica Roem defeated Republican Bob Marshall, an outspoken social conservative who unsuccessfully sponsored a so-called bathroom bill in the state Legislature and refused to call Roem \"she\" or \"her.\" Democrat Chris Hurst, a former local news anchor whose girlfriend and fellow reporter Alison Parker was murdered on live TV in 2015, also flipped a House seat from GOP control. Other contests weren't as much of a surprise. In New Jersey, Democrat Phil Murphy easily bested Republican Lt. Gov. Kim Guadagno. Outgoing GOP Gov. Chris Christie has the lowest approval ratings of any governor in the country, and Trump remains deeply unpopular there as well.  And in New York City, Democratic Mayor Bill de Blasio was easily re-elected to a second term. It was the Virginia contests that were seen as the better bellwether ahead of 2018, when Democrats are hoping to make major gains as Trump's approval ratings continue to plummet. The last few weeks of the Virginia contest turned especially bitter as the race tightened. Gillespie doubled down on a Trumpian message, promising a crackdown on violence by Latino gangs and pledging to protect Confederate monuments. The messaging was a major turn for the former Republican National Committee chairman, but had he been successful it would have meant Republicans nationwide would not be afraid to embrace Trump's more populist, anti-establishment message come next year. Instead, Gillespie's hard right turn \u2014 after nearly losing the primary to a far-right challenger \u2014 didn't pay off in the general election. Northam, meanwhile, tried to unite Democrats' centrist and progressive wings, although he upset the latter last week when he said he would be willing to sign a bill banning so-called sanctuary cities for undocumented immigrants. Those divides didn't appear to hurt him at the ballot box. In his victory speech, Northam didn't mention Trump by name, but his message was clear \u2014 Virginia will be a welcoming place in comparison to Trump's immigration policies and broader nationalist agenda. \"We live in a very diverse society. It is getting more diverse every day. It is that diverse society that makes this country great,\" Northam said. \"And as long as I'm governor I will make sure that we're inclusive, that we welcome people to the commonwealth of Virginia.\" Ultimately Democratic turnout was high across the commonwealth, and Northam was running well ahead of Clinton in key areas in the state. Exit polls showed that, in particular, college-educated white voters turned out at higher levels than in 2016 to support the Democratic ticket. While nearly half of voters said Trump didn't factor into their decision, those who said they showed up to show opposition to the president were more than double the number who said they voted to show support for Trump.",

            "article_content": "Tuesday is Election Day. One of the main contests is in Virginia where the race for governor has tightened between Republican Ed Gillespie and Democrat Ralph Northam.  RACHEL MARTIN, HOST: Tomorrow is Election Day. It's an off year, so there aren't a whole lot of contests. The highest profile one, though, is in Virginia where the governor's mansion is up for grabs. Democrat Ralph Northam and Republican Ed Gillespie are in a close race. NPR's Sarah McCammon has been covering it, and she joins us now from Virginia Beach. Hey, Sarah. SARAH MCCAMMON, BYLINE: Hi, Rachel. R. MARTIN: What's going on in Virginia? Set up the race for us. MCCAMMON: Yeah. Well, the race here is seen as a bellwether quite often. And while that might be a little bit overplayed - in part because Virginia is right next to D.C., so the national media pay attention - there is some merit to that. For example, Virginia's been a swing state in recent years, tends to elect governors from the opposite party of the sitting president. So it'll be interesting to see if that pattern continues. There are some good signs for Democrats. The state's demographics have been moving in their favor. Virginia was the only southern state to vote for Hillary Clinton last year. Obama won it twice. The current governor and senators are both Democrats - are all Democrats. But at the same time, Rachel, Republicans dominate the legislature, and this is an off year, which tends to be better for Republicans. Recent polls, at least some of them, suggest independents are fairly split between the two candidates. So they're both really trying to close the deal now. R. MARTIN: So you said that in some ways it can be viewed as a bellwether. How so? What's at stake in this race? MCCAMMON: So a lot of people are looking to the Virginia governor's race really for a snapshot of what's happening inside each of the major parties. R. MARTIN: Right. MCCAMMON: Right. Both are reacting to the 2016 campaign, which, as we know, exposed some big divides not only in the country as a whole but also within the major parties. So the race is kind of seen as an indicator of how voters are responding to President Trump. I mean, he has low favorability ratings overall but still a lot of strong support among core Republicans. And it's also, Rachel, a chance for both Republicans and Democrats to test their messages ahead of 2018. Those midterms are going to be really important, and they want to get a sense of where the voters are at. R. MARTIN: Yeah. So how are each of these candidates, each of their parties, how are they talking about President Trump? MCCAMMON: Well, in various ways. So Republican Ed Gillespie went into this race seen as a moderate establishment candidate. He has really moved to the right, and that is partly because he faced a surprisingly strong challenge in the primary from a candidate named Corey Stewart who ran as a populist pro-Trump candidate and did far better than ever expected. Stewart's now running for Senate in 2018, and he recently told me he thinks President Trump has changed the GOP forever into a more populous party. COREY STEWART: Candidates who embrace the president, candidates who are more populist and support the president's agenda will be successful. And those who refuse to change will eventually go the way of the dodo and disappear. R. MARTIN: The dodo, wow. MCCAMMON: And Gillespie - yeah. Gillespie seems to have embraced that. He has moved to the right, embraced some of the cultural themes that President Trump has emphasized. He's run ads focused on crimes committed by undocumented immigrants and expressed opposition to removing Confederate monuments. R. MARTIN: Yeah. OK, so what about the Democrats? What does this race tell us about where they're at, where they're headed? MCCAMMON: Well, Democrats have seemed to struggle a bit to focus their message. They're also talking about President Trump. The Democratic candidate, Lieutenant Governor Ralph Northam, has framed the race as a referendum on Trump. But Democrats seem to be kind of split about how to capture some of the anti-Trump energy among liberal voters while still reaching out to those rural, white voters that Democrats have been so worried about. Northam's been trying to energize black voters and younger voters who are so important to Democrats. The question is whether he can turn out enough of those base voters in this off year. R. MARTIN: NPR's Sarah McCammon in Virginia Beach. Thanks, Sarah. MCCAMMON: Thank you. Copyright \u00a9 2017 NPR.  All rights reserved.

Many conservatives pundits and lawmakers were incensed that President Donald Trump appeared to make a deal with Democrats to enshrine into law the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program that shields many undocumented immigrants who were brought into the U.S. as children.  To make matters worse for immigration hawks, Trump is also not requiring funding to build a wall along the Mexican border as a condition of the possible deal. For Trump, who campaigned in favor of the border wall and for ending the DACA program, his reversal is a major test of the so-called Fifth Avenue principle he gave during the election. \"They say I have the most loyal people. Did you ever see that? Where I could stand in the middle of Fifth Avenue and shoot somebody and I wouldn't lose any voters. It's like incredible,\" said Trump during a campaign stop in Sioux Center, Iowa in January 2016. If the reaction of those at a gathering of social conservatives in Iowa over the weekend is any guide, Trump's voters are sticking with him and not immigration opponents such as U.S. Rep. Steve King, R-Iowa, who tweeted last week that if a deal is struck, \"Trump's base is blown up, destroyed, irreparable and disillusioned beyond repair.\" @RealDonaldTrump If AP is correct, Trump base is blown up, destroyed, irreparable, and disillusioned beyond repair. No promise is credible. https://t.co/uJjxk6uX5g \"I don't think it'll break up the base because I think those that are be behind [Trump] will be behind him permanently,\" said Dick Gabriel, a retired education administrator from Indianola, Iowa, one of hundreds who gathered Saturday night for the Iowa Faith and Freedom Coalition Fall Family Banquet in Des Moines.

Gabriel said he didn't have strong feelings about DACA, but he said Trump deserves credit for reducing illegal border crossings considerably even if the wall hasn't been built. \"The idea of the wall is to reduce illegal immigration and he hasn't even put up a wall and look how much it has been reduced.\" Trump says he plans to continue pushing to build the wall. Over a meal of fried chicken, mashed potatoes and cookies, the attendees heard from Iowa's top elected Republicans, including King, who didn't directly criticize Trump but alluded to the DACA issue.

None of the Republicans who spoke on-stage, which included both U.S. Senators and the governor, addressed DACA. To the extent banquet-goers praised Trump for talking to Democrats and said they were frustrated with congressional Republicans. \"He's possibly able to get more done with Democrats, if that happens maybe we're getting more independent perhaps,\" said John Kerber of Johnston, Iowa. Trump's decision to not insist on funding for the wall as a condition of any deal wasn't seen as a betrayal to Kelsey Bayliss, a pharmacist from Wellman, Iowa. \"I think the wall itself will be built. I think it is good to work with Democrats with regards to DACA, I think there's a mutual agreement on everything. And we need to forget who's Republican and we need to forget who's Democrat and work for the better of the country. Her husband, Austin, chimed in that after months of working with Republicans, Trump is finally getting a chance to use his famed negotiating skills. \"I think this is the beginning of the art of the deal and it's about time.\" Trump won Iowa by nearly ten points last November, the biggest Republican victory in the swing state since 1980. \"We will absolutely stand behind President Donald Trump,\" said Iowa GOP Chairman Jeff Kaufmann from the podium. \"He is our president and we are proud of him as the Republican Party of Iowa. Period!\" The crowd applauded and some even gave Kaufmann's pledge a standing ovation.",

            "article_content": "Muslim children are more likely to be bullied in school than children of other faiths. A new survey by the Institute for Social Policy and Understanding (ISPU) reveals that 42 percent of Muslims with children in K\u201312 schools report bullying of their children because of their faith, compared with 23 percent of Jewish and 20 percent of Protestant parents. These results confirm recent findings by other research and advocacy groups showing that bullying of students of color is on the rise. After hearing stories from educators nationwide about the recent surge in bullying, Maureen Costello, director of the Teaching Tolerance program at the Southern Poverty Law Center (SPLC), decided to investigate. During the election, Costello sent a questionnaire to thousands of educators across the country. The results were startling. Over 90 percent of educators reported that school climate had been negatively affected by the election. In an earlier survey last March, with over 5,000 respondents, more than 1,000 mentioned Donald Trump \u2014 five times more than the other politicians mentioned in the survey combined. \"The elephant in the room was that Mr. Trump's campaign had an effect. We could not avoid the fact that children were imitating him both in word, tone and behavior, said Costello. According to the SPLC's study, \"The Trump Effect\" arises from comments the President has made about immigrants and minorities, which have emboldened politicized bullying in schools. Muslim children, in particular, have been primary targets for hate incidents. While the SPLC's results are not scientific, the organization says a \"tremendous number of responses as well as the overwhelming confirmation of what has been anecdotally reported in the media cannot be ignored or dismissed.\" Ron Avi Astor, a professor at the University of Southern California who studies school violence, finds the survey results unsurprising. \"I get lots of calls from schools and school districts. There's been a two-year spike in school bullying and harassment, and right now there is a generalized climate of permission to say hateful things to other groups that are deemed as 'different.'\" While Astor said that many groups, especially Jewish, Latino and undocumented children, have also been the target of hateful remarks, he acknowledges that Muslim children are often under particular stress as many of them come from immigrant families. Although negative stereotypes, prejudice, and discrimination towards Muslim Americans increased after the September 11, 2001 attacks, then president George W. Bush quickly condemned equating Islam with terrorism. In an address to a joint session of Congress just nine days after the attack, Bush said, \"the enemy of America is not our many Muslim friends... Our enemy is a radical network of terrorists and every government that supports them.\" In contrast, President Trump has taken a more inflammatory approach to addressing Islamic extremism. The President has not only issued restrictions on immigration from several majority-Muslim countries, but he has also blamed Muslims for shootings in Orlando and San Bernardino. Schoolyard bullies aren't the only ones who have taken President Trump's words to heart. The ISPU study also revealed that teachers and school officials have participated in one in four bullying incidents involving Muslim students. Last year, the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) filed letters of complaint with the U.S. Department of Justice and U.S. Department of Education on behalf of an 11-year-old Muslim Somali refugee student who was repeatedly discriminated against by his teacher in Arizona. \"I can't wait until Trump is elected. He's going to deport all you Muslims,\" the teacher exclaimed, according to the ACLU letter of complaint \"Muslims shouldn't be given visas. They'll probably take away your visa and deport you. You're going to be the next terrorist, I bet.\" Soon after, the boy's classmates followed the teacher's lead and called him a terrorist, according to the complaint. They also accused him of planning to blow up the school bus on the ride home. When the boy's mother complained to the school, administrators encouraged him to withdraw. Incidents like these can cause what social epidemiologist Nancy Krieger calls \"embodied inequality.\" Researchers from Northwestern University have found that everyday feelings of discrimination increase the body's levels of cortisol, the primary stress hormone. Similarly, Kathryn Freeman Anderson, a sociologist at the University of Houston, has found that emotional and physical stress from perceived racist treatment is linked to overall poorer mental and physical health. While similar studies have primarily concentrated on blacks and Latinos, Farha Abbasi, an assistant professor of psychiatry at Michigan State University and managing editor of the Journal of Muslim Mental Health, warns of the dangers of overlooking the experiences of Muslim youth. \"At the moment, we see high stress and anxiety as well as a sense of uncertainty regarding what the future will hold,\" said Abbasi. \"There is a reinforcement of distance of the hyphenated self. Muslim-Americans are being forced to choose an identity rather than being allowed to choose both. Suddenly, American Muslims are being cast as the 'other' and being forced to choose an identity.\" According to Abbasi, racism and discrimination can cause a cycle of \"defensiveness, dissociation, disconnection, dissonance and, finally, distress or desperation.\" To her, the increase in bullying among Muslim schoolchildren is a life-or-death matter. People who are bullied are more susceptible to suicide. \"Think of trauma and toxic stress as putting brick over brick on someone's shoulder,\" she explained. \"Right now, many Muslim children are carrying a very heavy burden and one more brick can be the breaking point.\" While Costello estimates that over 70 percent of bullying is based on bias and group differences, most anti-bullying programs do not incorporate culturally responsive training. To education activists like Debbie Almontaser, founding and former principal of the Khalil Gibran International Academy, New York City's only Arabic-language public school, this oversight prevents teachers and administrators from fully comprehending and responding to the severity and offensiveness of comments made to students. \"I'd like to see schools provide teachers with culturally responsive training where educators not only learn about Muslim children and their faith, customs, and traditions, but also about the vast diversity of the public school system,\" she said. Almontaser has advocated for students across the city whose complaints about harassment by peers have not been taken seriously. Recently, she collaborated with the Coalition for Educational Justice, a group pushing for equity in New York City public schools. The organization's goal is to ensure that schools are sanctuaries from racism, misogyny, and xenophobia. Heather Weaver, a senior staff attorney at the ACLU, says that \"under Title IV, schools are not only prohibited from discriminating against students on the basis of race, religion, nationality, and other characteristics, but they also have an obligation to stop harassment of those protected categories.\" In addition to their ongoing Arizona case, the ACLU is also engaging school districts across the country to stop harassment of Muslim students. Despite these troubling trends, many activists and educators remain hopeful. \"While the number of hate crimes has been on the rise, the support from other communities has been tenfold,\" said Faiyaz Jaffer, a chaplain at New York University's Islamic Center. Following the election, a Muslim student prayer room was vandalized with pro-Trump graffiti, but by the end of the week, students organized a rally against hate. A recent poll by the Pew Research Center found that Americans are expressing warmer feelings towards a variety of religious groups. Costello also emphasizes the large number of schools that did not experience an increase in bullying following the election. \"There are some schools that have done a very good job at making anti-bullying programs part of their school culture, and have really fostered a culture of respect around the idea of respecting diversity and thriving in difference. We've also heard stories about students allying themselves with students being targeted and standing up for them and making it clear they had their backs,\" she said. Nicole Cobb, executive director of school counseling at Metro Nashville Public Schools, counts her district among those that have weathered the post-election anxiety with success. Despite being Tennesse's second largest school district, Nashville accounts for only 12 percent of statewide bullying incidents. Following the election, MNPS issued a statement offering special free post-election counseling for any student experiencing anxiety or stress. The district has also been awarded a grant to implement social and emotional learning programs that help foster positive school climates. Cobb believes this approach has enabled them to better support students as they navigate waves of emotions. But Almontaser cautions that support for students cannot end with support groups. \"The best way to help children in the current climate is through counseling, but also through educating them about their rights.... It's important that they know that the United States is founded on vast, diverse community and that educators are not only focused on creating safe communities, but tolerant ones.\" Akinyi Ochieng is a writer and researcher studying at the London School of Economics.

Researchers have long been confused by what seems like a paradox: many people in America vote against their economic self-interests. Whether it's the working class conservative who wants a tax cut for the wealthy, or a member of the liberal elite who fights for safety nets that raise his own taxes \u2014 we don't always act in the way that would help us the most. In her new book, Strangers in Their Own Land, sociologist Arlie Hochschild tackles this paradox. She says that while people might vote against their economic needs, they're actually voting to serve their emotional needs. Hochschild says that both conservative and liberals have \"deep stories\" \u2014 about who they are, and what their values are. Deep stories don't need to be completely accurate, but they have to feel true. They're the stories we tell ourselves to capture our hopes, pride, disappointments, fears, and anxieties. Hochschild spent years in Louisiana trying to understand the deep stories of conservative, white, heterosexual, working-class Americans. Their deep story focused on the American Dream: the idea that, if you work hard and play by the rules, you can have a better life. But what happens when that dream doesn't come true? When people see \"line cutters\" getting ahead while their own lives don't seem to be going anywhere? According to Hochschild, Donald Trump was able to tap into these deep stories. He offered a narrative that confirmed how these people feel. His rhetoric gave them a way to talk openly about their deep stories \u2014 perhaps for the first time.

Until President Obama ended the so-called wet-foot, dry-foot policy on Thursday, Cubans who reached U.S. soil either by sea or land were allowed to stay and seek permanent residency. There's a popular saying in Spanish \u2014 O todos en la cama, o todos en el suelo. It conveys a selfless commitment to equal treatment, and translates roughly like this: Either we all get the bed, or we all get the floor. Among many immigrants in the U.S., there's been a feeling that when it comes to the spoils of U.S. immigration policy, the government has given Cubans the bed all to themselves, while it has relegated others \u2014 Mexicans, Haitians, Central Americans \u2014 to the floor. This is because of the so-called wet-foot, dry-foot policy, which since 1995 has granted Cubans who touch American soil a privilege not afforded other immigrants who come without a visa: the right to stay and get on a fast track to citizenship. This special treatment ended this week when, in the final days of his administration, President Obama announced an abrupt end to the policy, a capstone to his two-year-old effort to re-establish relations with Cuba. Effective immediately, Cubans arriving on U.S. soil without a visa will be treated just like any other immigrant. They will be turned away. This does not mean Cubans will stop coming. \"What it means,\" said Florida International University political scientist Eduardo Gamarra, \"is that for the first time, we're going to have undocumented Cubans. And how the Cuban community responds to that is going to be very interesting.\" For decades, Cubans have occupied a rarefied station, particularly among the Latino population of the United States. Because those arriving in the U.S. after Fidel Castro's ascension in 1959 were seen as fleeing political persecution, the U.S. generally allowed them to stay. In 1966, Congress passed the Cuban Adjustment Act, which allowed Cubans to get green cards after being in the U.S. for two years, later reduced to a single year. Though the Cuban government opposed these policies, they were the status quo until 1994, when the U.S. agreed to amend the rules. Wet-foot, dry-foot allowed only those Cubans who made it to U.S. soil to stay. Those caught at sea were to be turned away. The stated hope was that the threat of getting repelled would discourage Cubans from risking their lives on rickety boats. But they kept coming, and once here, a green card was pretty much ensured. Leaving their country has always carried risk for Cubans, as it has for other immigrants. But unlike for their counterparts, the specter of illegality and all its repercussions (see: the 2016 presidential election) has not applied to Cubans. They have never really had to worry, for example, about deportation once they've made it to the U.S. This privilege has affected in fundamental ways the identity that Cuban-Americans have forged both in terms of their place in American society and in relation to other Latino groups. \"Cubans have never been, and have never seen themselves, as 'illegals,' or even, particularly, as a minority group,\" said Guillermo Grenier, a sociologist at FIU who is Cuban-American. \"They have never seen themselves as anything other than added value to this country. It's part of the Cuban exceptionalism narrative that is just as strong as the American exceptionalism narrative.\" The dynamics here are complex. That stems in part from the fact that most of the Cubans who fled Castro's regime soon after the 1959 revolution were political exiles, not economic migrants. They were of the largely white middle class whose property and businesses Castro seized and nationalized. Beginning in the '60s, these exiles used their entrepreneurial drive to turn Miami into a vibrant frontier city. That's always been a schism impeding solidarity between Cubans and other Latino groups. Sociologist Guillermo Grenier Over the decades, this set Cubans apart from many other Latinos in the U.S., who aside from tending to be economic migrants also lacked the legal status that would have allowed them to achieve their full potential. Even as the makeup of the Cuban influx began to change in the '80s and '90s \u2014 with more Cubans coming for economic reasons \u2014 wet-foot, dry-foot allowed them a unique confidence in their place in the United States. \"That's always been a schism impeding solidarity between Cubans and other Latino groups,\" Grenier said. Though it has rarely led to full-blown tension, it has been more evident at times, as it was last year when large groups of Haitians and Central-Americans seeking asylum found themselves stuck at the U.S.-Mexico border while long lines of Cubans got through. \"The policy has clearly contributed to that,\" Grenier said. The fact that Cuban-Americans, unlike other Latinos, have traditionally been a reliable conservative voting block has also contributed to this schism. And even as the Cuban-American political center has shifted to the left in recent years, Grenier said, there is a built-in distance when it comes to issues like immigration between the young Cubans marching for immigrant rights and the Mexicans, Guatemalans and Colombians with whom they're linking arms. \"It's a feeling of solidarity with other Latinos and their plight,\" Grenier said. \"You see young Cubans fighting for the other guy.\" Grenier said he expects the end of wet-foot, dry-foot to gradually change notions of Cuban-American identity as newer migrants become subject to the construct of \"illegality\" that drives so much of the policy and rhetoric around immigration in the United States. While before, young Cubans were fighting for the other guy, \"now you're going to be fighting for yourself,\" Grenier said. \"You're going to have a horse in the race.\" Gamarra said Cubans in the U.S. are going to find their community stratifying in ways familiar to other Latino groups. \"You're going to have privileged and nonprivileged Cubans,\" he said. \"You're going to find the phenomenon of people trying to demonstrate that they were here before yesterday. You're going to find mad rushes to find ways to become documented.\" At the same time, Gamarra says the end of wet-foot, dry-foot will not necessarily usher in a level playing field. Obama kept in place a policy that grants roughly 20,000 visas to Cubans annually, a relatively large number for an island of 11 million people. Nonetheless, Gamarra said the policy's end may strengthen solidarity between Cubans and other Latinos, \"because we aren't all going to be on the bed together,\" he said. \"We're all going to be on the floor.\"",

When the cardinal's residence was built in the 1920s atop a hill in the leafy, most western outpost of Boston, it was modeled after an Italian palazzo. The grand mansion, replete with ornate mahogany and marble appointments, stood as a testament to the Boston Archdiocese's stature in the very Catholic city of Boston. Political candidates \u2014 local and national \u2014 would come calling, and even the pope came to visit. When Cardinal Bernard Law took up residence in the Renaissance Revival mansion, Boston's Roman Catholic movers and shakers would flock to the backyard for his garden party fundraisers. Today, a steady stream of students hauling backpacks and members of the public traipse across that same property. The mansion, now owned by Boston College, has been gutted and converted to an art museum and meeting rooms \u2014 a remarkable fall from grace that parallels that of the Boston Archdiocese itself. A total of 65 acres of prime church property \u2014 possibly its most valuable in Massachusetts \u2014 was sold in a fire sale after the clergy sexual abuse crisis, when the church was struggling to pay some $85 million in settlements to victims. In the years since, the cost of settling claims surpassed $200 million, and the church's declining fortunes have been more than just financial. There's no doubt that since the great scandal broke ... our public voice has been muted in many ways because our moral authority has rightly been questioned. Domenico Bettenelli Law's death this week reawakened a flood of emotion and anger over the decades of sexual abuse that finally came to light in 2002 and at the archbishop's role in allowing predator priests to move to new parishes, where they would prey on more victims. The revelations that began in Boston eventually engulfed the church worldwide, and the reverberations continue to be felt, nowhere more so than in the once all-powerful Boston Archdiocese. \"The church's influence took a big hit in 2002; that's undeniable,\" says Domenico Bettinelli, who used to be director of new media for the Archdiocese and now works as an anti-abortion rights activist. \"There's no doubt that since the great scandal broke ... our public voice has been muted in many ways because our moral authority has rightly been questioned.\" It's a far cry from the old days, when the church was almighty and the cardinal was closer to a king, according to Thomas P. O'Neill III, former Massachusetts state legislator and lieutenant governor. He is the son of the former speaker of the U.S. House of Representatives, Tip O'Neill. \"When my dad served in the state legislature and Cardinal [Richard James] Cushing said [to do] something, I can assure you, a Catholic majority in the state legislature paid attention to it, and did it,\" says O'Neill. Powerful ambitions Law long hoped he could command that kind of obedience after he arrived in Boston in 1984. With his booming baritone and penchant for the regal trappings of the office, he did engender a deference and reverence that was in no small part derived from his influence with the Vatican. As one of the most senior American prelates, he was as well-connected as he was well-regarded outside Boston. He had the ear of Pope John Paul II and was talked about as the man who might become the first American pope. He was in regular conversation with President George H.W. Bush and was a player on the world stage, instrumental in arranging the pope's first visit to Cuba. He was described in a 1990 newspaper article as \"the first Archbishop of Boston to have a foreign policy.\" Law celebrates his first Mass after he was elevated to cardinal in 1985, at Our Lady of Victories Church in Boston.\n                \n                    \n                    Charles Krupa/AP\n                    \n                \nhide caption Law celebrates his first Mass after he was elevated to cardinal in 1985, at Our Lady of Victories Church in Boston. A 1990 Boston Globe story, headlined \"The Cardinal's Ambitions,\" outlines a typical week in Law's life; \"He had mulled over Third World debt with Mexican bankers in Washington, D.C., brainstormed anti-abortion strategy with U.S. bishops in New York City, and jolted a visiting Northern Ireland official with a pointed question about conditions in Catholic schools there. The following Sunday he would leave for Cuba and his second tete-a-tete with Fidel Castro.\" But at home, the Catholic Church's influence was on a slow decline that had begun under Law's immediate predecessor, Cardinal Humberto Sousa Medeiros, who largely refrained from politics. By the time Law came to town, shifting demographics and changing social mores had significantly altered the landscape, further diminishing the church's authority. And much as he wanted to reclaim the clout wielded by Cushing, Law never quite could. \"Law wanted to play that role and re-create that world, in a sense, but that world was already gone,\" says James O'Toole, a history professor at Boston College and former archivist for the Archdiocese of Boston. \"There was a kind of polish to him as someone who knew what position he was in and he was going to run with that, but he wasn't able to do it.\" \"By the time I got [into politics], you weighed everything that was being said by the church hierarchy, and you did it respectfully,\" says O'Neill. \"But did you follow blindly? No. Those days were all gone by the time I got there. [Lawmakers] paid attention to [Cardinal Law] ... but they did not always comply.\" The election of 1986, O'Toole says, already revealed how the cardinal's rigid Roman orthodoxy and rightward leaning wasn't flying with his Massachusetts flock. Law lobbied for two referendum questions: one to ban state funding for abortion and the other to permit some state support of parochial schools. \"Cardinal Law campaigned very strongly on both of those issues, and he lost both of them decisively,\" O'Toole says.

Law was said to have had the ear of John Paul. By the time another decade passed, the gap had so swollen between Boston's Catholic Church and Boston Catholics on social issues, leaving Law venting that both Massachusetts senators and the governor were wrong on the abortion issue. \"Only I am right,\" he said. A few years later, the church would also falter in its efforts to block gay marriage, as lawmakers were paying more heed to the voice of their constituents than to the cardinal's. \"There used to be an assumption that [the archdiocese] was speaking for the majority of people in the church,\" says state Rep. Byron Rushing. \"But the average Roman Catholic state representative or state senator knew that there were many Roman Catholics in their district that are in favor of it. They weren't all on the same page ... [like] in the old days.\" Still, the institutional power of the Catholic Church in heavily Catholic Boston, would continue to earn Law a ranking by Boston Magazine as one of the three most powerful figures in Boston, even through the late 1990s. \"Everything went right over the cliff\" Former Attorney General Martha Coakley says that sway was what enabled the archdiocese to keep the lid on the clergy abuse and on what higher-ups were doing that allowed the abuse to continue. \"The church as an institution was incredibly powerful in Boston, in protecting its records and using its authority to cover up what was in retrospect, an awful conspiracy to hide [the abuse] and protect the church's reputation,\" she says. But when the 2002 sexual abuse crisis threw the church into turmoil and prompted a furious backlash, it was all over. With the church under siege, the balance of power shifted abruptly. Law became the \"poster boy\" for the church's cover-up. The cardinal's mansion was surrounded every day by swarms of protesters calling for his resignation. From his mightiest perch, he was reduced to being grilled by victims' lawyers, under oath, about what he knew and when he knew it. One attorney recalls that when pressed during a deposition, Law turned to his attorney, protesting and asking whether he really had to answer. The answer came back that yes, he did.

Law was described in a 1990 newspaper article as \"the first Archbishop of Boston to have a foreign policy.\" \"The church lost all its influence,\" Rushing says. On Beacon Hill, the church's longtime lobbyist, who had been a fixture at the State House, didn't even dare show up. \"I would joke with him,\" Rushing recalls. \"You know like, 'You can always come into my office, because I know you don't want to go anywhere else in the building.' \" The cardinal, never shy to testify on legislation or use his bully pulpit, was rendered effectively mute. He was sidelined on issues he would have been spearheading, like a Boston Hotel workers strike that involved poor and immigrant workers. Legislation moved through the State House, including requiring health insurance to cover contraception and hospitals to offer the morning-after pill. On the other hand, Rushing says the church's retreat was a big blow to other progressive/liberal efforts he would have liked the church's help on, like increased assistance to the poor people and immigrants. \"We lost that lobby,\" Rushing says. \"They just stopped doing it.\" Shortly after the crisis, some Catholic priests in Massachusetts were even flouting the church by speaking out against a ban on gay marriages in Massachusetts, prompting a stern rebuke from above. At the same time, the church's financial clout took a nosedive as well. Angry, disillusioned parishioners were leaving in droves, and donations \u2014 from collection plates and from large institutions \u2014 were drying up. After the crisis, the annual Boston Catholic Appeal plummeted to half of what it was. \"Everything went right over the cliff,\" said one church official, not authorized to speak on the record. \"We were basically in a freefall.\" O'Neill says the Catholic faithful began to distinguish between the mission of the church and the institution of the church and found ways to support the former but not the latter. He says that is still happening, as he saw recently, when fundraising for a local Catholic school. \"In the old days, the Catholic Church would support it almost in its entirety,\" he says. \"Today, you have private folks making contributions directly to [foundations that support that mission] as opposed to through the apparatus of the archdiocese.\" Climbing out out of crisis mode By all accounts, Law's successor, Cardinal Sean O'Malley, has worked small miracles to restore confidence in the church. Soft-spoken and low-key (he is way more comfortable in the traditional plain brown habit of his Franciscan order than the regal garb that Law favored), O'Malley has showed genuine compassion for the victims and a deep commitment to their healing and to church reform. Church officials say attendance has finally stabilized, and donations have climbed back up to pre-crisis levels. The coffin of Law, who died this week, sits at the St. Peter's Basilica on Thursday.

His death  reawakened a flood of emotion and anger over the decades of sexual abuse that finally came to light in 2002. \"If you told me before Sean O'Malley had become the cardinal of Boston, that anyone could have come and done the repair that Sean O'Malley has done, I'm not sure I wouldn't have believed you,\" says O'Neill. \"I think everybody \u2014 even Catholics not practicing today \u2014 have a very deep-seated respect for Cardinal O'Malley.\" Politically, the archdiocese is slowly recovering some of its voice but seems to be strategically picking and choosing its fights to stay more in sync with Boston Catholics. For example, O'Malley has been championing the cause of undocumented immigrants and speaking out on opioid addiction, violence prevention and education. \"We're out of crisis mode now, and Cardinal O'Malley is much more engaged politically,\" the church official says. The church recently managed to pull off a legislative win, helping defeat a measure that would have allowed physician-assisted suicide. But Bettinelli cautions that even that vote doesn't necessarily mean an upswing in the church's influence. Lawmakers are voting \"based on their faith,\" he says. \"But I don't think it's necessarily because they are being influenced by [O'Malley].\" Catholic participation remains low; just about 20 percent attend weekly Mass, compared with 70 percent in the 1970s, according to the church. Money remains tight, and despite the softer tone coming from both Pope Francis and O'Malley, doctrine is not budging on issues like abortion, contraception or gay marriage. And so the chasm between the church and many of its parishioners on social issues is only widening. Law talks to reporters in Rome in March 1989. Even before the sexual abuse scandal, the Catholic Church's influence was on a slow decline in Boston.\n                \n                    \n                    AP\n                    \n                \nhide caption Law talks to reporters in Rome in March 1989. Even before the sexual abuse scandal, the Catholic Church's influence was on a slow decline in Boston. \"The rigid school of Catholic doctrine ... doesn't sell in the 21st century,\" says says Lawrence DiCara who was Boston City Council president in the 1970s. Close to 70 parishes have been eliminated since 2004, a trend almost surely accelerated by the scandal but reflective of the broader shift of Catholic America from the old heartland of Boston, New York, Chicago and Philadelphia to the South and Southwest. Today, in keeping with his more down-to-earth style, O'Malley tries to reboot and boost the Catholic Church from a modest rectory in the heart of Boston, far from the once majestic mansion that was home to his predecessors. O'Neill was one of the movers and shakers who once reveled at the big parties at Law's residence. \"Those were the happy days,\" he sighs. He was also there for the small, private meeting at which a handful of Law's closest confidants told him it was time to quit. \"That was the end of it,\" O'Neill says. Now, he says, \"this church is a church in repair, and we have a long way to go.\" Then, ever faithful, he adds, \"But I think the [new] leadership is destined to do the right thing, and get us to that point.\" As O'Toole puts it, \"it's dangerous for a historian to talk about the future but ... the revival will come at some point. You know maybe 100, or 200 years from now ... But I don't think [this decline] will be permanent.\"",

While the Trump administration continues the federal government's already-massive deportation program, 11 cities and counties will be joining the list of jurisdictions providing legal defense for undocumented immigrants at risk of deportation. The Vera Institute of Justice, a nonprofit that researches and advocates changes in the criminal justice system, launched the Safety and Fairness for Everyone (SAFE) Cities Network this past week. The cities and counties making up the network will be providing legal counsel for immigrants facing deportation proceedings. Vera says it selected the jurisdictions for committing to invest public money toward defending immigrants against deportation. The nonprofit says it will use a fund it administers to match the public money. \"Immigration is part of our nation's past, present, and future, and our communities will find more opportunities to grow and thrive when we recognize and embrace this fact,\" Vera Institute President Nicholas Turner said in the statement. \"That means that all residents must see their justice systems \u2014 from our law enforcement to our courts \u2014 as delivering on our country's promise of fairness.\" The cities and counties making up the SAFE Cities Network are: They're joining a growing list of cities and states with similar programs. Late last year and earlier this year, lawmakers in Los Angeles, San Francisco, Washington, D.C., and New York City decided to allocate public funds for defense in immigration courts, while New York state created the first statewide immigrant defense fund. In Maryland, Baltimore Mayor Catherine Pugh announced on Thursday that the city had joined the SAFE Cities Network. \"Our community is safest when our neighbors trust their officials and institutions and know they will be treated justly and with dignity,\" Pugh said in a news release. \"Providing legal representation to those facing deportation maintains trust in law enforcement and our local institutions and keeps us all safe. If our residents don't feel safe \u2014 for example, coming forward to report crimes and cooperating with law enforcement \u2014 all of us are at more risk.\" It's the latest move from cities and states looking to challenge the president's immigration policies. President Trump vowed to deport millions of people in the country illegally. Cities that pledge to limit cooperation with federal immigration agents \u2014 \"sanctuary cities\" \u2014 have faced pressure from the Trump administration over much of the past year. Providing legal counsel to undocumented immigrants does not mean they will be immune from deportation. But there's evidence their likelihood of staying in the country will increase. A recent report from the Vera Institute found free legal defense for immigrants in New York City was associated with an increased likelihood of immigrants' court visits playing in their favor. Four percent \"of unrepresented, detained cases\" at one New York City court initially had \"successful outcomes,\" the nonprofit says. After providing legal defense, that number went up to almost half. In 2015, the University of Pennsylvania Law Review published a similar study, saying immigrants with legal representation were significantly more likely to stay in the country. Immigrants in detention with legal help were 10 and a half times more likely to \"succeed\" in their cases as opposed to those representing themselves. Previously, cities that have begun to implement similar programs have met opposition. A member of Chicago's city council voted against using public funds for immigration defense, calling it \"the legal defense fund for the illegals,\" the Chicago Tribune reported. There has also been an argument regarding which immigrants should be provided a defense lawyer. As The Intercept reported, this was a heated debate in Los Angeles that brought up plenty of questions, one of which examines the distinction between a \"good\" immigrant and a \"bad\" one \u2014 and if this should be considered at all. With the recent local elections in which Democratic candidates won up and down the ballot, more jurisdictions may join the ranks attempting to show their support for undocumented immigrants \u2014 and opposition to the Trump administration.",

Gov. Ralph Northam, (L) shakes hands with Republican challenger Ed Gillespie after a debate at the University of Virginia-Wise in Wise, Va., Monday, Oct. 9, There's no such thing as an off year in Virginia politics: it's one of two states, along with New Jersey, holding gubernatorial elections in 2017. Those races can serve as a testing ground for the political parties' messages ahead of the 2018 mid-terms. The Virginia governor's race has been tight, with recent polls predicting contradictory results. The stakes feel especially high this year in the wake of the 2016 presidential campaign, which exposed divisions not only in the country as a whole, but in both major parties. Attack ads have escalated in recent weeks, as two candidates who were seen months ago as moderate, establishment figures within their respective parties have pitched increasingly dire messages to their core voters. On the Republican ticket, Ed Gillespie's resume is arguably straight from the Washington, D.C. \"swamp\" that President Trump has promised to drain: he's a former Republican National Committee Chairman, George W. Bush Administration adviser, and lobbyist. Ed Gillespie speaks at his rally in Fredericksburg, VA, on Nov. 1.\n                \n                    \n                    Sarah McCammon/NPR\n                    \n                \nhide caption Ed Gillespie speaks at his rally in Fredericksburg, VA, on Nov. 1. His Democratic opponent, Lt. Gov. Ralph Northam, has sought to paint Gillespie as a Washington politician out to benefit himself, in contrast with his own background as a pediatric neurologist. None of that bothers Trump supporter Laurie Posner, a retired paramedic from Stafford, Va. who came to hear Gillespie speak this week in Fredericksburg. She wore a black \"Make America Great Again\" ball cap to the Republican get-out-the-vote event at the Fredericksburg Expo and Conference Center, a salmon-pink building about an hour from Washington, D.C. that usually hosts gun shows and craft fairs. Posner said Gillespie is saying what she needs to hear about issues like immigration. \"Everything that Trump wants for America, Gillespie wants that too,\" she said. \"He will follow the agenda of our president. And that's what we need.\" Gillespie has been working to energize Trump supporters like Posner, without turning off moderates by aligning too closely with the President. He's run controversial ads focusing on crimes committed by undocumented immigrants, but he's never brought his own party's sitting President to Virginia to campaign on his behalf. On stage in Fredericksburg, before a nearly all-white audience, Gillespie alluded to the racial and identity politics that have popped up in the campaign. He referred to what he called a \"vile despicable ad\" from an outside group, the Latino Victory Fund, which depicted children from racial and religious minorities running away from a pickup truck with a Gillespie bumper sticker. The ad was quickly pulled in the wake of the deadly truck attack in New York City. Gillespie criticized Northam for not disavowing it; Northam defended the ad and then said it wasn't the sort of ad he would have chosen to air, according to the Washington Post. \"That revealed that he does not just disagree with millions of his fellow Virginians; he disdains millions of his fellow Virginians,\" Gillespie told the crowd.

Ralph Northam speaks to business leaders in Chesapeake, Va. on Sept. 30.\n                \n                    \n                    Sarah McCammon/NPR\n                    \n                \nhide caption Lt. Gov. Ralph Northam speaks to business leaders in Chesapeake, Va. on Sept. 30. Meanwhile, Northam has also faced attacks from the left wing of the Democratic Party. In October, he came under fire after his African American running mate, Justin Fairfax, was left off some campaign leaflets passed out as part of voter mobilization efforts. The leaflets were distributed on behalf a labor union that had declined to endorse Fairfax because of his opposition to proposed pipelines through Virginia. Northam's campaign spokesman has acknowledged that the matter was \"mishandled,\" and Northam has since appeared with Fairfax at multiple campaign events. This week he further angered some liberal activists when he told Norfolk TV station WAVY he'd be willing to sign a bill banning sanctuary cities for undocumented immigrants, and that \"I've always been opposed to sanctuary cities.\" As lieutenant governor, Northam cast a tie-breaking vote against legislation that would have banned hypothetical sanctuary cities in Virginia, even though the state doesn't have any sanctuary cities. As a result, Gillespie has accused Northam of casting a \"deciding vote\" in support of sanctuary cities, a claim that FactCheck.org has labelled \"misleading\" because of the complicated larger context around that vote. The liberal group Democracy for America responded with a scathing statement calling Northam's campaign \"disastrous and racist.\" The group's original founder, former Democratic National Committee Chairman Howard Dean, denounced the move as \"destructive and foolish.\" In an effort to shore up support with core voters, Northam has been campaigning with prominent black Democrats, including former President Obama last month in Richmond. Campaigning with New Jersey Senator Cory Booker in the D.C. suburbs on Wednesday, Northam framed Virginia's governor's race as a referendum on Trump. \"We cannot let what we saw in 2016 \u2013 and now what we're watching in Washington, D.C. \u2013 we can't accept that as being the new normal,\" Northam said. In this off-year campaign - where turnout is low and stakes are high \u2013 both parties are making the race about President Trump.",

Updated at 4:07 p.m. ET Attorney General Jeff Sessions defended his prior testimony about his contacts with Russia's ambassador during last year's presidential campaign during an at-times contentious appearance before the Senate Judiciary Committee on Wednesday. Sessions also said he has not been questioned by special counsel Robert Mueller's office, which is looking into Russian interference during the presidential race. Sessions tangled with Democratic senators over his testimony during his confirmation hearing in January, when he told panel members that he \"had no communications\" with Russian officials during the campaign. In March, The Washington Post reported that Sessions had met with then-Russian Ambassador Sergey Kislyak twice during the campaign. Sessions then recused himself from the probe into Russian interference in the election after the meetings were revealed. Sessions said Wednesday that he did not recall any discussions about the Trump campaign during his meetings with Kislyak but that he may have talked about some of then-candidate Donald Trump's positions. He denied meeting with any Russian officials to discuss coordination between the campaign and Russia. Sen. Al Franken, D-Minn., accused Sessions of \"moving the goalposts\" in his testimony \u2014 \"morphing,\" Franken said, from first denying any contact whatsoever with Russia to saying there had been no discussion of the political campaign and now to saying there was no discussion of any interference in the election. \"That to me is moving the goalposts every time, and at the end, we're going to need a 75-yard field goal,\" Franken said. Sessions said Franken was being unfair to him. In a later exchange with Sen. Patrick Leahy, the Vermont Democrat accused Sessions of being part of a \"Russian facade.\" Sessions said he was hurt by that remark, adding, \"I'm not part of a facade.\" Another line of questioning from Democrats was into President Trump's firing of former FBI Director James Comey. Under questioning from the panel's ranking Democrat, Sen. Dianne Feinstein of California, Sessions said he doesn't think \"it's been fully understood the significance of the error\" Comey made in the investigation of Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton's emails. Feinstein asked Sessions about his role in the firing of Comey in May. Sessions indicated he supported the decision, criticizing Comey's conduct. Sessions said he had \"never heard of an investigator\" declaring the closing of an investigation as Comey did with the probe into Clinton's use of a private email server while she was secretary of state during the Obama administration. Sessions said he was particularly concerned that Comey said he would do it again. Sessions said there was a need for \"a fresh start\" at the FBI but said his discussions with President Trump on the matter were confidential. Sessions was also asked about the Justice Department's withholding of federal law enforcement grants to some states because of so-called sanctuary city policies, under which local police have refused to turn over suspects being held for other crimes to Immigration and Customs Enforcement for deportation. Sen. Dick Durbin, D-Ill., cited the high number of killings in Chicago. \"Undocumented immigrants are not driving crime in Chicago,\" Durbin said, adding, \"You're not helping us solve this murder problem by taking away these funds.\" Sessions responded that he is \"worried about the health and morale of the Chicago police department,\" adding that \"politicians cannot say that if you remove a violent criminal from America that's illegally in the country and is arrested by the Chicago police and put in the Chicago jail that once they are released they shouldn't be turned over to ICE officers to be removed from the country.\" Sen. John Kennedy, R-La., also expressed concern that law enforcement grants to his state were being reduced because of policies in New Orleans. In his opening statement, Sessions rebuffed the panel's Democrats on the issue of executive privilege. Last week, all nine of the committee's Democrats had written the attorney general regarding potential assertions of executive privilege during Wednesday's hearing. \"We expect that ... you will have determined whether the president will invoke executive privilege as to specific topics and will be prepared to answer completely all questions in those areas on which he has not,\" the Democratic senators said in their letter. Sessions had refused to answer questions relating to the Russia probe in June testimony before the same committee, saying it was inappropriate. On Wednesday, Sessions told the panel that he \"will not be able to discuss the contents of my conversations with the president\" and essentially returned to that rationale several times during the hearing when questions touched on discussions with Trump. In defending his reliance on the executive privilege in order to not breach the confidentiality of discussions with the president, he later added that the executive branch is a co-equal branch and told senators that \"you would not want someone demanding to know who you talk to in your office\" and, likewise, Supreme Court justices' would not someone inquiring into the details of their discussions with their law clerks. Sessions also addressed concerns of Sen. Mike Lee, R-Utah, about the government's asset forfeiture program, under which federal agents can seize private property, even if the property's owner has not been accused of a crime. Sessions told Lee that he was aware of the concerns about the program, saying he had merely restored it to its status prior to former Attorney General Eric Holder's move to limit its scope. He said the Justice Department's newly announced director of asset forfeiture accountability will review the policy, and \"review any complaints that arise.\"",

President Trump has recently taken a series of what appear to be bold executive actions to reverse Obama-era policies: declining to re-certify the Iran nuclear deal, halting subsidy payments to insurance companies and setting an expiration date for the DACA immigration program. But, in so doing, he's dumping thorny problems on a GOP-controlled Congress already struggling to rack up significant legislative accomplishments. This did not go unnoticed by one of the top Democrats in Congress. Trump \"throws destructive bones to his base then tells Congress to fix it: Iran, Health care, Puerto Rico,\" Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., tweeted Saturday. .@POTUS\u2019 M.O.: failure to lead. Throws destructive bones to his base, then tells Congress to fix it: Iran, Health care, Puerto Rico While Trump said Friday that Iran had violated \"the spirit\" of the 2015 nuclear deal, he didn't pull out of the multi-nation agreement, at least not yet. Instead, he opened the door for congressional action \u2014 and that's exactly what he's asking for. \"I am directing my administration to work closely with Congress and our allies to address the deal's many serious flaws so that the Iranian regime can never threaten the world with nuclear weapons,\" Trump said. And with that Trump dumped another item on Congress' already very full plate. Just the night before he had announced another decision that could well require Congress to step in: halting cost-sharing subsidy payments to insurance companies. Those payments were designed to keep premiums down for low-income consumers, but Trump said they are illegal and just a gift to insurance companies. Democrats and moderate Republicans including Charlie Dent of Pennsylvania and Ileana Ros-Lehtinen of Florida expressed dismay at the move. Both Dent and Ros-Lehtinen have already announced they do not intend to run for re-election next year. Cutting health care subsidies will mean more uninsured in my district. @potus promised more access, affordable coverage. This does opposite. \"We at the end of the day will own this. We, the Republican Party, will own this,\" Dent said in an interview on CNN. \"I believe his action will force us to enter into some kind of a bipartisan agreement on the cost-sharing reduction payments\" to stabilize the insurance markets. Trump said stopping the payments was part of an effort to undo the Affordable Care Act. \"One by one it's going come down, and we're going to have great health care in our country,\" Trump said in a speech at the Values Voter Summit on Friday. \"We are going to have great health care in our country. We are taking a little different route than I had hoped because getting Congress \u2014 they forgot what their pledges were.\" Still, he said he hoped this would prompt Congress to take bipartisan action to repeal and replace Obamacare. He said Friday he wants Democrats to come to him. They aren't. And even when it comes to Republicans, it's not clear the president and the various factions in Congress are even remotely on the same page about how to proceed. And that's not the only item the president wants Congress to act on. There's also the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program for undocumented immigrants brought to the country as children. When Trump announced he would put a six-month expiration date on the program, he tweeted, \"Congress, get ready to do your job - DACA!\" Congress, get ready to do your job - DACA! Early on, it looked like he had reached the broad outline of an agreement with Democratic leaders in Congress, only to then release a list of hard-line demands that Democrats \u2014 and even many Republicans \u2014 won't support. \"What I want is tremendous border regulation. I want the wall. And we're going to get other things,\" Trump told Sean Hannity on Fox News. \"And we're going to see if we're going to work something out. Now whether or not we do, I don't know. But it would be wonderful to solve the DACA problem.\" When Trump says \"we\" as he discusses DACA, Iran and health care, he mostly means \"them.\" Congress will have to do all the heavy lifting. And none of this will be easy for a GOP-controlled Congress (narrowly in the Senate) that is far from unanimity on any of these matters. \"Every time you buck some issue over to their plate, you blow the place up,\" said Sarah Binder, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution who specializes in Congress. \"And Congress is not a well-oiled machine, so disrupting the agenda and putting more things on their lap \u2014 issues which are really wedge issues within the Republican Party ... it's almost mind-boggling to me that a president who doesn't see himself as part of the party in Congress puts them back in that situation.\" And all of these items come on top of what was supposed to be the top priority for congressional Republicans this fall: passing a tax system overhaul. In the midst of everything else, Trump has been campaigning for tax cuts and other changes to the tax code. He suggested maybe it could be a \"Christmas gift\" to Americans. A more likely Christmas gift could well be a shutdown showdown over must-pass government funding legislation. The current funding expires Dec. 8, and at least some of these issues could get wrapped up in negotiations. On Friday, Schumer did express optimism that at least the health care subsidies could pass that way. \"I think we're going to have a very good opportunity in the omnibus to get this done in a bipartisan way, if we can't get it done sooner,\" he said.",

            "article_content": "Antonio S\u00e1nchez, the virtuoso drummer and composer, can often be found on tour \u2014 tending rhythmic fires for guitarist Pat Metheny; leading Migration, his own dynamic post-bop band; or performing his solo drum score at screenings of Birdman or (The Unexpected Virtue of Ignorance), the 2014 Alejandro G. I\u00f1\u00e1rritu film. For the moment, though, S\u00e1nchez is back home in Mexico City, catching up and checking in. His network of family and friends made it safely through the 7.1 magnitude earthquake that killed hundreds and caused massive destruction there. \"The way people have come together, it's incredible,\" he says, speaking by Skype over the weekend from his mother's house. \"But the recovery will go on for a long time. Just like in Puerto Rico.\" S\u00e1nchez lives in New York \u2014 but along with his ties to Mexico City, he has a small beachfront apartment in Puerto Rico. (\"I don't even know what state it's in now,\" he says.) So the devastating natural disasters of the last couple of weeks have hit close to home on more than one front. \"In these times,\" he says, \"a good humanitarian leader that really brings people together would make a big difference. And obviously there's none of that going on.\" To put it mildly, S\u00e1nchez is not a big fan of President Donald J. Trump. He's full-voiced with his criticism on social media, and has now found a musical outlet for it: S\u00e1nchez's new album is Bad Hombre (CAM Jazz), a solo drums-and-electronics odyssey that functions in one sense as his follow-up to the award-winning Birdman score. In another sense, of course, Bad Hombre is a rejoinder to then-candidate Trump's infamous quip last year about undocumented Mexican immigrants in the United States: \"We have some bad hombres here, and we're going to get them out.\" The line stirred up outrage and ridicule, but for S\u00e1nchez it also rang the alarm. \"It's been a long road, immigration-wise, for me,\" he says, recalling a succession of bureaucratic hurdles stretching back to the early 1990s, when he was studying at the Berklee College of Music. After years of dutiful visa renewals, he received a green card in 2007. He finally secured his American citizenship last fall, just in time to cast his first vote in a presidential election. S\u00e1nchez will play a trio set Wednesday at the La Paz Jazz Festival on the Baja peninsula. Then he'll return to the states to perform live Birdman screenings on Friday, at the AT&T Center in Dallas, and on Oct. 9, at Walt Disney Concert Hall in Los Angeles. He says he's still puzzling over how to adapt Bad Hombre to a live performance setting. For now, the album is a world unto itself \u2014 albeit one that holds a funhouse mirror to our own. Nate Chinen: It was a stray remark from one of the presidential debates last year that gives your album its title. How were you specifically motivated by the idea of someone in power who has said inflammatory things about Mexicans? Antonio S\u00e1nchez: The music is definitely influenced by it, in the sense that it's a somewhat dark album that was conceived first during the election cycle and then after he won. So it's a very personal thing that I feel, obviously because of what you mentioned. He really took it upon himself to go after Mexicans right off the bat, with absolutely no provocation at all, when he announced his candidacy. And it's just been downhill from there. You recently bought a house in Jackson Heights, Queens, and I read somewhere that the establishment of a home studio was integral to being able to make this album. I don't think I would have been able to pull this off without that studio. When I realized how much time I spent on it, and how much more relaxed I was \u2014 like, I'm not running against the clock. I would record a bunch of drums, then work on the electronic sounds on the road, and then again when I got back home. So it was an on-and-off process, but it wouldn't have happened without this amazing lab I was able to build in the basement of our house. It's interesting to think about this album as an electronic project of sorts. It's not a drums-first record all the time. Was that something you set about to do after the explicitly percussive nature of Birdman? I wanted to find a balance between soloing, playing really busy, and then having enough electronic content that would make the sonority of the album something different. The juxtaposition of the acoustic drums with the all-electronic background, that's what was interesting about this whole thing. I was completely improvising on the drums, without thinking too much. I would improvise on one particular vibe for hours. Then once I had enough material, I would start splicing it, editing it, trying to condense a few hours of improvisation into seven minutes or so. Sometimes I would actually be editing the drum tracks and adding electronics as I went along \u2014 kind of discovering the story of each tune as I went along. Were there any specific sources of musical inspiration for this album? Not really, but I was listening to a lot of music that probably influenced me in some ways. I'm a big fan of Hiatus Kaiyote, the Australian band \u2014 and even though they're not an electronic band, they have a lot of electronic elements. I was listening to some Boards of Canada, Aphex Twin. Bonobo. Little Dragon. All these bands that have very rich production value. But a lot of them don't really have real drums. Right, I was about to say that you just named some really celebrated drum programmers. Exactly. So I think if I would have made this record exactly the way it is and then programmed some drums, the sonority of the whole thing would have been completely different. But just the fact that it's jazz drums with jazz cymbals ... and of course I tweaked the sound quite a bit, and I was able to experiment with different techniques. So, things like: \"OK, what would it sound like if I put a T-shirt on the drums and then a cymbal on top and then I tape it to the side of the drum, and then I move the mic a little bit and then I hit it with something different from a stick?\" All of a sudden, I was discovering all these sonic possibilities that I'd never been able to put on tape before. You open the album with a corrido and a recitation by your grandfather, the celebrated actor Ignacio L\u00f3pez Tarso, who is now 92. Was that an immediate thought for you? Like: \"If we're going to talk bad hombres, let me find the baddest hombre I know\"? To begin the record, I wanted something that was inherently Mexican, no mistaking it. My grandfather came to mind, and I thought about having his voice in there, and then a mariachi band, and my drums on top with some electronics. That was something that at least for me would be completely new and different. I found this corrido that I love, \"Benito Canales,\" and it turned out it was in the same key as this groove that I had already done. And it really moved me to have the voice of my grandfather. Immediately I thought, \"Well, he's the ultimate bad hombre.\" He's such an example of a Mexican that is incredibly hardworking, supported his whole family doing what he loved, which is acting. He changed acting in Mexico. That just really rounded out the whole concept for me. Was his artistry, and his eminent stature, a source of inspiration to you back when you were forming your identity? Oh, absolutely. I grew up going to rehearsals, and he would bring whole theater companies to lunch at home. I love the show business side of it. Acting never really interested me, because I was playing drums already. We did a pilot together, I must have been seven. It was a traveling circus, but even in the pilot I was already playing drums: it was a circus story, and in the circus I had a little snare drum, and was playing behind some of the acrobats. Really the main thing that happened from seeing him in action was being inspired to pursue what I wanted to do. Seeing him be so successful, so well respected, so revered, and financially he was always well off. He accomplished a lot. So for me to see that firsthand was a very powerful image, and made me want to go for it. And now you're someone who is celebrated when you return home. How has that evolved? Back in 2002 I played here with the Pat Metheny Group. It was the only time the group played here, and it was a huge deal because Pat had never been here. Then I came back in 2003 with my own trio; I brought [saxophonist] David S\u00e1nchez and [bassist] Reuben Rogers to this beautiful theater. Those things established me a little bit in people's consciousness: This guy is good, and he's doing some stuff that no other Mexican has been able to do before. So every other year, I would come and do something with different bands. I have a few friends who are promoters. But after Birdman ... because I\u00f1\u00e1rritu is also Mexican, it had big consequences in the press. And because my name was attached to the project, by default I ended up getting a lot of good rep because of that. Seeing how much it changed after Birdman was kind of shocking. Now I can come and do anything I want and usually people are behind me. You can trace a clear line from the Birdman soundtrack to Bad Hombre, but the previous album and project you put together, The Meridian Suite, was an ambitious longform composition for jazz ensemble. Will you pursue both paths, going forward? I cannot see myself leaving either one of those, because I'm really both things at the same time. I cannot satisfy my compositional ambitions in a project like Bad Hombre, and I cannot fulfill these other, more experimental ambitions with my band, at least so far. I really admire people that have a long and varied discography. I'm very interested in that, and exploring all kinds of different paths that I have in my head. The next project is a big band record of my music arranged by Vince Mendoza, with the WDR Orchestra in Cologne. It's finished, and should come out on CAM Jazz in March. I like it when each record is completely different from the previous one. That's a big swing of the pendulum, from solo drums and electronics to Vince Mendoza orchestrations. To swing it back to Bad Hombre: What would you say to someone who raises an eyebrow to the outspoken statement behind this album? Artists usually transform what's going on in life and then put it into our work. Art is a reflection of life. And it would have been incredibly hard for me to ignore what has been happening and just make a record that has absolutely nothing to do with the political and social climate that we're living in the States. Especially because of my Mexican origin. A lot of people write to me on Facebook, and some of them say \"I love your drumming but your politics suck. I wish you would not use your platform to plug your political views.\" To them I always say: \"Precisely because I have a platform, I'm going to use it to say what I think.\" I think it's incredibly important for me, for other musicians, to not normalize the situation. Not stay quiet and just do my music. I am from Mexico, I'm a minority, I'm brown. I can't help but be influenced in a really, really big way by everything that's going on. If this album creates a small platform for me to be able to talk about it, that was basically the idea.",

            "article_content": "Two Young Migrants and the Making of an American Life by Lauren Markham Hardcover, 352 pages | Your purchase helps support NPR programming. How? Lily Meyer works at Politics & Prose Bookstore in Washington, D.C. I'm a book reviewer. Most of the time, it's not my job to write about politics. But it would be impossible to write about Lauren Markham's The Far Away Brothers without writing about our political moment \u2014 or, if not impossible, both cowardly and pointless, since the project of The Far Away Brothers is a political one. Markham began writing it while a school administrator in Oakland, where she worked with dozens of students who had arrived in the United States from Central America's Northern Triangle as unaccompanied, undocumented minors. Her students told her the stories of how and why they came: in a bag that someone threw over the border wall, on the top of a train, on a bus pretending to be a coyote's son, all of them hoping for a better life, which \"for many, means a life where they are not afraid of being killed.\" Markham wrote The Far Away Brothers to pass those stories on. Her main subjects are a pair of Salvadoran twins who she met while she worked at Oakland International High School. She calls them Ernesto and Ra\u00fal Flores, and she begins their story in 2013, when their gang-affiliated uncle Agust\u00edn takes a dislike to Ernesto that turns into MS-13 threats against his life. Before long, Ernesto understands that he has to flee El Salvador, as does his identical twin. So they find coyotes and go to join their brother Wilber, who has been living without documents in the Bay Area for years. Three years later, when Markham ends the book, Ernesto and Ra\u00fal are still living in California, and Donald Trump has just been elected president. I say ends the book rather than ends the story because there are no conclusions in The Far Away Brothers. When the book stops, Ernesto has just had a child; Ra\u00fal is struggling to complete high school. Both have green cards. Both hope they will be able to find a true and enduring place in this country whose voting populace, by the measure that matters, has just declared them unwelcome. It's hard to predict, on a personal or a political level, whether that hope will come true. As I read The Far Away Brothers, I thought frequently of Adrian Nicole LeBlanc's Random Family, an exceptionally detailed portrait of two women struggling to create families and keep them together in a low-income section of the Bronx. LeBlanc spent 11 years with Jessica, Coco, and their families. She writes movingly about her relationships with the two women, and about their ongoing generosity in choosing to be her subjects. It's a gesture of extreme trust. LeBlanc knows this and is grateful, and the same clearly goes for Markham. When she first knew Ernesto and Ra\u00fal, they \"encouraged [her] to write a book about 'kids like us.'\" After they became legal adults, she asked if she could write not about kids like them, but about them. They agreed, but she struggled with the ethics of the project, finally deciding, \"[If] I could trust myself to tell their story respectfully and carefully, and if the twins accepted and encouraged the idea, it was appropriate for me to write this book.\" The Far Away Brothers is respectful and careful. It is elegantly structured and constantly empathetic. It's clear that Markham did her work well, and that the Flores brothers \u2014 and, in fact, the entire Flores family \u2014 were invested in the process. But it's clear, too, that she was not woven into the fabric of Ernesto and Ra\u00fal's lives. The book is more known than felt. It's too filled with statistics; the numbers start to blend. It lacks the depth and emotional clarity that Random Family achieves so well. I blame this on Donald Trump. Those of us who were born in this country need as many reminders as possible that some Americans are made, not born. Some Americans make themselves. The Flores brothers did, through danger and debt and depression. I'm not kidding. I think the flaws in The Far Away Brothers are Trump's fault, not Markham's. I understand that the Flores brothers and thousands of unaccompanied minors like them arrived in the country before Trump was elected, before anybody could have imagined that he would be. I understand that the eight years of Barack Obama's presidency were also a terrifying time for undocumented migrants. And yet, as Markham writes, \"the election of Donald Trump [marks] an era of unprecedented fear among immigrants and refugees past and present.\" If she rushed her book out, it's no wonder. We need to read it now. In fact, clearly we needed to read it a long time ago. So yes, I wish Markham had spent 11 years following Ernesto and Ra\u00fal Flores. I wish she could have watched Ernesto raise his daughter Isabella, the first American citizen in a family that had sent three children north. I wish she could have found out whether Wilber was able to get a green card, or whether the oldest Flores sister, Maricela, ever emigrated from El Salvador as she hoped to. But in this year of America First, no writer has time to spare. Those of us who were born in this country need as many reminders as possible that some Americans are made, not born. Some Americans make themselves. The Flores brothers did, through danger and debt and depression. Markham captures their absolute bravery well, and she respects it absolutely. For that reason alone, you should read The Far Away Brothers. We all should.",

The long lines of early voters outside Cardenas market became a lasting image of the 2016 presidential vote in Nevada. Latinos turned out in force at the Latin American grocery store in Las Vegas, helping deliver the state to Hillary Clinton. Today, the shoppers at the strip mall are more hesitant, most refusing to talk politics. They're afraid, some say, because they feel like the government is targeting them. \"Oh my God. It's crazy what he's doing right now, and I just had a kid,\" said Marisol Hernandez. She motions to her baby, strapped in a baby seat and settled in her shopping cart. Hernandez was referring to President Trump's latest decision regarding immigrants, ending the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, or DACA, which has allowed young people brought to the country as small children to obtain work permits and avoid deportation. For many Latinos, it is just the latest blow. Many say they feel under siege by Trump's relentless calls for building a wall on the Mexican border, and measures like his pardon of Sheriff Joe Arpaio in Arizona's Maricopa County, who was convicted for contempt of court for ignoring a judge's order to curtail a crackdown on immigrants. Many believe the moves will further energize Latino voters to go to the polls, posing a danger for Republicans in states like Nevada with significant and growing Latino populations. The state will be an important political battleground next year when Republican Sen. Dean Heller defends his seat. Heller is seen as one of the most vulnerable senators in the country, and he's already distancing himself from Trump's immigration positions. On Monday, Heller told the Reno Gazette-Journal that \"While I remain concerned about the way in which DACA came to life, I've made clear that I support the program because hard working individuals who came to this country through no fault of their own as children should not be immediately shown the door.\" About 17 percent of eligible voters in Nevada are Latino. And Nevada's Republican Gov. Brian Sandoval made it clear he supports DACA. He said in a statement that he was \"proud to sign into law legislation that allowed DACA recipients to become licensed teachers in our schools and provide a path for them to earn a driver's license which has increased safety for all Nevadans.\" It's not the first time Sandoval has been publicly critical of Trump's decisions. He was a vocal opponent of plans to repeal and replace the Affordable Health Care Act over the summer. Laura Martin, associate director of the Progressive Leadership Alliance of Nevada, which advocates for immigrants' rights, agreed that Trump's policies are creating an atmosphere of fear among all Latinos. About 13,000 people have DACA in Nevada, a state with one of the highest rates of undocumented people in the country. \"It affects so many people here. You can't live in Nevada and not know somebody who would be directly affected by this,\" Martin said. Trump, she said, \"is casting a wide net and he is encouraging people to see someone maybe like me, the color of my skin, the texture of my hair and make an assumption and that just puts people in danger and that's where the fear comes. \" She says since Trump was elected, her office gets hate mail and people threatening to call immigration. One email she received recently said this. \"Everyone of you illegals should be gathered up and deported. You bring disease, crime and corruption.\" It ends \"leave, NOW.\" Michael Kagan, director of the immigration law clinic at the University of Nevada Las Vegas's law school, said Trump is seen as not just against illegal immigration, but all immigration. \"What I see is that Donald Trump has gone back on many things he said in the campaign, on many issues, but he's actually been very consistent, on being anti-immigrant and appealing to a white voting bloc,\" said Kagan. \"He's an anti-immigrant president.\" Kagan says that Trump seems willing to sacrifice the Latino vote for the rural, white vote in middle America that helped get him elected. Democrats are jumping on the DACA decision to get Latino voters registered and to the polls in the next election, and they likely will find a receptive audience. While Latinos have historically voted more Democratic, their low turnout rates means their potential voting power has never been fully realized. Hernandez, who voted last year at the Cardenas grocery store, says she'll vote again to push the president out. \"What did the Hispanics, and everyone that's not white, do to him?\" Hernandez asks. \"Why did he say 'oh the first thing I'm going to do is I'm going to put a wall.\" But there are Latinos who vote Republican, and believe Trump will bring positive immigration reform. Clinton didn't fare as well among Latino voters as Obama did in 2012, according to the Pew Research Center. Anthony Osnaya is a construction work who came from Mexico when he was 16. He ran for local office last year as a Republican because, he says, the party aligns with the Latino's community's values, such as family and hard work. Osnaya said he's a staunch Trump supporter. He told NPR he was hoping Trump would preserve DACA, then said he had no further comment once the details of the decision became public. \"It's just media, feeding terror kind of, making him into a bad guy, a bad president, the worst,\" Osnaya said. \"He's just doing his job.\" The so-called \"Dreamers\" also are mobilizing. Miriam Cadenas, who has DACA, made thousands of phone calls and knocked on doors to get people out to vote last year, trying to protect herself. The 20-year-old was brought to the U.S. from Mexico when she was eight. But her 4-month-old son is a citizen, and she fears being separated from him. \"People asked 'Well, why don't you vote?' Well, I can't or else trust me I'll be the first one,\" she said. \"But the people who have DACA had a huge impact. That was all of our work, calling people, getting them registered. We did our part by turning Nevada blue.\" \"The Latino vote is very important. We're here and we're not going anywhere,\" she said. \"I feel like [Trump's] behavior, the only thing it's going to do is bring all of us together and fight and give him a run for his money.\"",

The former Maricopa County sheriff was found guilty Monday of criminal contempt, a charge that carries a maximum sentence of six months in jail. Joe Arpaio, the former sheriff who garnered nationwide attention for his crackdown on illegal immigration, has been convicted of criminal contempt by a federal judge in Arizona. The ruling carries a possible maximum sentence of six months in jail and a monetary fine for the 85-year-old Arpaio. The misdemeanor criminal conviction handed down Monday by District Judge Susan Bolton found that Arpaio knowingly violated a federal judge's order in 2011. At that time, Arpaio was told he could not detain immigrants simply because they lacked legal status \u2014 but for 18 months, his deputies carried on with the practice. NPR's Richard Gonzales explained how the controversy unfolded: \"In December 2011, U.S. District Judge G. Murray Snow issued a preliminary injunction ordering Arpaio and his deputies to stop targeting Latino drivers. Prosecutors allege that Arpaio's deputies defied the injunction for at least 18 months. In May 2013, Snow ruled that Arpaio's office had engaged in racial profiling. \"Arpaio and his deputies have admitted to violating the judge's order, but they claim their defiance wasn't intentional.\" For these violations, Arpaio was found to have committed civil contempt. But Arpaio has long maintained he did not do so intentionally \u2014 and so is innocent of criminal contempt \u2014 because the judge's order was unclear. As member station KJZZ notes, \"his attorneys argued that the violations were a result of poor communication and a lack of understanding by Arpaio and his command staff.\" Now, Bolton has rejected Arpaio's argument. He \"willfully violated the order by failing to do anything to ensure his subordinates' compliance and by directing them to continue to detain persons for whom no criminal charges could be filed,\" Bolton said in her decision. During his 24 years as sheriff of Maricopa County, which contains the Phoenix metro area, the self-styled \"America's Toughest Sheriff\" found plaudits in many conservative circles for his severe enforcement policies \u2014 and deep criticism from others who said his practices amounted to racial profiling. That long tenure ultimately ended last November when he lost his re-election bid, just two weeks after being slapped with the criminal contempt charge. \"Arpaio's supporters believe this criminal case is really about politics \u2014 Democrats trying to hurt a Republican sheriff,\" Jude Joffe-Block and Amita Kelly reported for NPR last month. \"Those supporters hoped the Trump administration would drop the criminal case\" \u2014 but federal prosecutors continued to press forward anyway. In a statement released Monday, the Maricopa Sheriff's Office called the verdict \"a conclusion to the disservice and distractions caused by former Sheriff Joe Arpaio.\" \"As for this office,\" the department continued, \"we remain steadfast in our efforts to serve the needs of public safety, to improve quality of relations with the community and to ensure that the men and women of this organization have the utmost respect for the law and the authority for which we are empowered.\" MALDEF, the Mexican American Legal Defense and Education Fund, said, \"The ruling essentially recognizes that local police lack the constitutionally-required evidence to detain or arrest undocumented immigrants who entered the country without inspection or who overstayed a visa.\" The group said requiring officers to enforce immigration law puts them at \"risk of being found guilty of significant legal violations.\"",

President Trump has reversed himself on one key campaign promise on immigration \u2014 and kept another. The Department of Homeland Security says it will preserve, for now, an Obama administration program known as Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, or DACA. It's the most explicit statement yet that the Trump administration will not seek to deport the so-called \"Dreamers\" who were brought to the U.S. illegally as children. At the same time, Homeland Security Secretary John Kelly officially revoked another program that might have protected some of their parents from deportation. Then-candidate Trump promised to get rid of both programs during last year's campaign, saying \"we will immediately terminate President Obama's two illegal executive amnesties\" during a major immigration speech in August 2016. But his position on so-called \"Dreamers\" has been shifting since the election. Here's where it stands now and what that could mean for \"Dreamers\" and their parents. 1. What did the Trump administration just do? In a FAQ posted on its web site Thursday night, the Department of Homeland Security says current DACA recipients \"will continue to be eligible for renewal,\" and that DHS will continue to abide by \"the terms of the original DACA program\" as outlined by the Obama administration on June 15, 2012. The Obama-era memo, issued five years ago this week, lays out who is eligible for DACA. It's also what protects people who signed up for the program from deportation, and allows them to apply for work permits. 2. Does this go beyond what President Trump had said before? Shortly after his inauguration, President Trump told ABC that DACA recipients \"shouldn't be very worried.\" \"I do have a big heart. We're going to take care of everybody,\" he told ABC. \"But I will tell you, we're looking at this, the whole immigration situation, we're looking at it with great heart.\" Trump suggested that a new DACA policy would be forthcoming, but did not clarify what it was. 3. Is this a victory for immigrant rights activists? Not exactly. It's clearly a relief for some of the roughly 800,000 people who've signed up for DACA. As the fifth anniversary of the program approached, there were fears that the Trump administration might abolish it altogether. \"It is an important win for those 800,000 individuals,\" says Muzna Ansari, immigration policy manager at the New York Immigration Coalition. \"But in the grand scheme of things, there are 11 million undocumented immigrants living in this country, who have really been living in fear\" under the Trump administration. 4. How do President Trump's supporters feel about it? Some are deeply disappointed. Others are willing to give the president the benefit of the doubt because his administration has been aggressively cracking down on illegal immigration across the board. \"He broke the DACA promise,\" says Dan Stein, president of Federation for American Immigration Reform, which advocates for lower immigration levels. \"Are we happy about it? No,\" Stein said. \"We think they should have allowed the work authorizations to expire. End of story, full stop.\" But Stein is taking the long view. He says the White House may want to use the DACA program as a bargaining chip in negotiations with Congressional Democrats on a broader immigration reform package. 5. What is DAPA, and how does it fit in? DAPA is shorthand for Deferred Action for Parents of Americans and Lawful Permanent Residents. It's another Obama-era program that would have extended protection from deportation even further. It was designed for the parents of U.S. citizens and legal residents who were themselves living in the U.S. illegally. But it was quickly blocked by the courts, and never implemented. DHS officially revoked DAPA on Thursday. But that was not a big surprise, since no one expected the Trump administration to defend the program in court, as the Obama administration had. 6. Is this a final decision on the future DACA? In a word, no. The White House and the Department of Homeland Security have been emphasizing that this is not a permanent decision, and that president could still change his mind and revoke that program, too. But for now, the administration continues to accept new DACA applications. And DHS says that \"no work permits will be terminated prior to their current expiration dates.\"",

But President Donald Trump's plans to ramp up deportations of immigrants in the U.S. illegally have cast a pall over her efforts. \"We have been working to develop economic tools for immigrants to open businesses, to buy homes, to be employed,\" she said. \"Our efforts are being threatened because there is that constant reminder in the back of their heads that they could be deported.\" As President Trump's widening deportation dragnet has heightened anxieties in immigrant households across the country, local officials have spoken about the moral responsibility they have to protect these families through steps like limiting the role police officers play in immigration enforcement. But in cities like Baltimore, which see growing their immigrant populations as a way to revive a shrinking tax base, there's also a strong financial imperative to act. Six decades of white, and more recently black, flight have driven Baltimore's population to a 100-year low. In recent years, only a couple of bright spots have emerged in this otherwise worrisome demographic picture. The city's Latino population has more than doubled in the last decade, while its Asian population has grown by 60 percent. Immigrants, Rodriguez-Lima said, account for much of that growth, and now make up about 8 percent of Baltimore's 615,000 residents. \"And we know that immigrants attract other immigrants,\" Rodriguez-Lima said. \"Friends and family tell other people that they were able to have a home here. So that's why it's so important to be able to retain those networks, because they themselves become a tool to attract additional immigrants.\" Unlike the mayors of major cities like New York, Chicago and Los Angeles, Baltimore's new mayor has not openly condemned President Trump's deportation efforts or publicly vowed to resist them. But the city has put some resources into efforts that protect its immigrant residents. Diana Morris, director of the Open Society Institute of Baltimore.\n                \n                    \n                    Adrian Florido\n                    \n                \nhide caption Diana Morris, director of the Open Society Institute of Baltimore. Last month, the city announced a $500,000 private fund to provide lawyers for immigrants facing deportation. Though Baltimore has not committed public money to the fund the way other cities have in announcing similar efforts, city officials are fundraising on behalf of the Open Society Institute of Baltimore, the private nonprofit managing the fund. \"We know that in immigration court proceedings, the outcomes are better if people do have representation,\" said Diana Morris, the institute's director. \"We want to make sure that people do have legal defense.\" Rodriguez-Lima, of the mayor's office, said the fund's creation is as much about protecting families from deportation as it is about protecting a population that officials see as an important and growing economic engine for the city's future. For a glimpse of this future, and of how it stands to be shaped by the fate of Baltimore's immigrants, Rodriguez-Lima pointed to Highlandtown, a historically blue-collar neighborhood in the southeastern section of the city. Eastern Avenue, which runs through it, is a canvas of freshly erected signs over once-vacant storefronts that now house Mexican and Salvadoran restaurants, immigrant-owned hair salons, and a 24-hour laundromat lined with jumbo washers. Rosa Martinez, an Ecuadorean immigrant, has lived in this neighborhood for more than a decade, but said its immigrant character started taking off in the last several years as more immigrants arrived and, feeling a measure of stability and belonging, began opening businesses. But things here started feeling different after the election. In early February, shortly after President Trump signed an executive order prioritizing a much broader pool of unauthorized immigrants for deportation, federal immigration agents picked up two men outside the neighborhood Walgreens. Though both were in the country illegally, advocates said neither had so much as a parking ticket on his record. News of the arrests rippled through the neighborhood's large undocumented population. The city's Highlandtown neighborhood has become an immigrant hub in recent years.\n                \n                    \n                    Adrian Florido\n                    \n                \nhide caption The city's Highlandtown neighborhood has become an immigrant hub in recent years. \"I tried not to really leave home,\" Martinez said, speaking in Spanish. \"Many of the mothers at my son's school, too. There was that fear of being picked up by immigration.\" News of immigration arrests often sends a chill through the neighborhoods in which they occur, affecting stress levels but also school attendance and business at local stores. During the early years of the Obama administration, Highlandtown residents were occasionally targeted, though by the end of his second term, Martinez and other immigrants here said, they felt more at ease. The prospect of a renewed and sustained period of enforcement is now front of mind, for both immigrants like Martinez, who fear for their safety, and for City Hall officials like Catalina Rodriguez-Lima, who fear also that the economic progress neighborhoods like Highlandtown have made in recent years could be reversed. \"That is a loss to the city,\" she said. Rodriguez-Lima is working to develop the legal defense fund and other ways to protect the city's immigrants. Martinez has started squirreling away money for an immigration attorney, just in case she gets picked up by immigration authorities. \"I've been saving, saving, saving,\" she said, \"because you never know what will happen.\" She stuffs the cash under her mattress, where her family will know where to find it.",

In the immediate aftermath of President Trump's victory in November, numerous liberal mayors and police chiefs across the country affirmed their commitment to making their cities sanctuaries for unauthorized immigrants. In Seattle, the day after the election, for example, Mayor Ed Murray said, \"These are our neighbors, and we will continue to support our neighbors. We can't allow ourselves to be divided and sorted out. That's not America.\" But while Murray's police department promises not to inquire about residents' immigration status in most cases, is it still a \"sanctuary\" city if the police department allows federal immigration authorities direct access to information about residents? Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) documents show that for years, law enforcement in hundreds of jurisdictions nationwide, including major sanctuary cities like Seattle, Washington, D.C. and Los Angeles, are feeding information into regional databases that can be combed through by ICE. When ICE needs information on residents for raids or criminal investigations, these regional databases can give ICE crucial information, like phone numbers, addresses, and comments about individuals' scars, marks and tattoos that may have not made it into federal records. Such locally-specific information can be helpful for ICE agents, especially in sanctuary cities where ICE often conducts immigrant raids in lieu of formal cooperation with local authorities. Local and federal law enforcement leaders argue that such data is crucial in carrying out criminal investigations that pose national security or public-safety threats. But while this access to local data is generally supposed to be used for law enforcement purposes, immigrants' rights activists worry such data sharing channels could harm immigrant communities, especially as the president casts a wider net in his illegal immigration crackdown. For instance, he has prioritized for deportation those who are accused but not charged with a crime. Where ICE can mine local law enforcement databases Since at least 2011, ICE officials have been able to search for information from nearly a thousand law enforcement agencies across the country, authorized by formal agreements struck between ICE and regional law enforcement groups. In an email, ICE spokesperson Matthew Bourke confirmed the agency can still directly \"ping\" for information in all of these local law enforcement databases, noting that none of these past data-sharing agreements have been invalidated since the first ones were signed in 2008. Below is a 2011 ICE map visualizing the law enforcement databases which ICE can still access. Bourke says no new agreements have been signed since a privacy impact assessment in October 2011. (A Freedom of Information Act request for the text of these agreements has been filed.) While other DHS agencies can also access these local law enforcement databases, past reports suggest that ICE is the primary department accessing this information. According to a 2011 DHS report, for example, between August 2010 and February 2011, ICE conducted 77 percent of all DHS agency searches of local law enforcement databases. Most of these searches pulled from state databases, such as those of Arizona and Texas, and metropolitan regional databases, such as those of the greater Los Angeles, Seattle, San Diego, and Washington D.C. areas. Past estimates have found that these states and metropolitan regions feature some of the deepest concentrations of unauthorized immigrants nationwide. Currently ICE has access to local law enforcement databases, organized by states, such as Arizona and Texas, and metropolitan regions, such as the greater Seattle, Los Angeles, and Washington D.C. areas. In Arizona, AZLink, the database that experienced the most DHS searches during this period, pools together information from numerous law enforcement agencies across the state. In the months following the election, most self-affirmed sanctuary jurisdictions involved in these agreements have not indicated that they plan to cut off these data-sharing channels with ICE. The Los Angeles Police Department, for example, says that it is not taking any steps to prevent ICE from accessing the information it feeds into a larger countywide law enforcement database. \"This is a crime fighting tool that enhances the Los Angeles Department's ability to conduct thorough investigations as criminals are not isolated solely to Los Angeles, but commit crimes nationally,\" said LAPD spokesperson Patricia Sandoval in an email. Kevin Harris, a spokesperson for D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser, stated that D.C. also plans to continue sharing data with a regional database accessible to ICE, though noted that such data does not include residents' immigration status and is restricted for \"law enforcement purposes only.\" Seattle Police Department spokesperson Sean Whitcomb did not directly respond to inquiries about the city's data sharing channel with ICE, stating in an email, \"Seattle is a welcoming city and we support the rights of undocumented residents.\" Immigration rights advocates argue such data sharing, even if restricted to law-enforcement purposes, as in D.C., still undermines these cities' status as sanctuaries. Neema Singh Guliani, a legislative counsel with the American Civil Liberties Union's Washington Legislative Office, said that many unauthorized immigrants have committed non-violent criminal offenses that ICE could target for \"law-enforcement purposes. \"Things that stem purely from immigration status, such as driving without a license or using a different Social Security number for work, are treated as crimes,\" says Guliani. \"So just because they're saying it's a law-enforcement purpose, doesn't mean it's not going to hurt most immigrants and further the Trump administration's agenda.\" How local police data is used by federal immigration authorities Local law enforcement data can be used in ICE investigations against a wide variety of targets, from suspected terrorists and drug smuggling organizations to unauthorized residents who have failed to comply with removal orders, according to Claude Arnold, a former ICE Homeland Security Investigations special agent. Arnold said that information from local criminal databases drives high-level ICE investigations, helping agents connect the dots among networks of human traffickers, money launderers, and other criminal organizations. \"We do a lot of intelligence sharing with locals, like the LAPD's child porn investigation unit,\" says Arnold. \"The purpose of that data sharing is for criminal investigations, and it is used to keep the country safe.\" CNN embeds with a team of Chicago Immigration and Customs enforcement agents as they fan out all over the sanctuary city. But Arnold also acknowledges that local law enforcement information, funneled through ICE's intelligence unit, can contribute to immigration enforcement, such as home raids against those who have not shown up to court to receive final orders of removal. \"So, for example, if ERO [ICE's Enforcement and Removal Operations wing] is doing an operation against fugitives with orders of removals, the intelligence people will give them their data,\" says Arnold. Government estimates over the last three years have found that the majority of unauthorized immigrants do not show up to court hearings in which their final removal orders are issued. When trying to find unauthorized immigrants at large, agents often rely on both private and public sources of data, like utility records and law enforcement databases, says John Sandweg, former acting director of ICE in 2013 and 2014. \"They have target lists of known undocumented immigrants, and then they tap into local law enforcement and drivers' license databases,\" says Sandweg. \"The main thing is to get the addresses, but 50 percent of these addresses aren't good, so sometimes they follow leads and end up at churches or workplaces.\" Sandweg stresses, however, that ICE already has its hands full just trying to deploy agents to pick up unauthorized immigrants from jails that do honor ICE's detainer requests. Local law-enforcement experts say their information may be particularly useful to ICE, given that federal databases often lack information captured during arrest, booking, and jail encounters. \"ICE doesn't itself collect the granular information we get from our jail, where we have emergency points of contact, phone numbers, and addresses,\" says Joel Rivera, a Division Chief of the Hidalgo County Sheriff's Office, whose department feeds into a Texas state database accessible to ICE. \"The database will also show case file numbers, so they can call us to get access to the full case files with even more information, like who has visited and called them in jail.\" This trove of granular data can then be linked to ICE's sophisticated data visualization tools. Aristides \"Harry\" Jimenez, a former ICE Homeland Security Investigations deputy special agent, notes that ICE agents deploy link-analysis software from the data-mining firm Palantir to discover connections between individuals, their addresses, and their property. \"When you have large volumes of transactions, you can start to see patterns and associations,\" says Jimenez, who notes that Palantir's software allows authorities to see network connections in what he calls \"a three-dimensional format.\" Guliani, with the ACLU, claims bulk data sharing practices between law enforcement and federal authorities could unfairly net unauthorized immigrants in ICE criminal investigations for low-level immigration related offenses or simply for ties to others under investigation. \"These databases may include information on people who have been arrested but not charged or arrested for protests,\" says Guliani, \"And there's a concern that this is providing a wealth of data to ICE to implement new policy lots of states or localities are trying to resist.\" The looming battle over immigrant data ICE access to law enforcement data could be particularly important for ICE actions in so-called sanctuary jurisdictions, where immigration authorities say they must carry out more \"at-large\" arrests in light of local authorities' refusal to hold unauthorized immigrants who have been deemed deportable by ICE beyond their release dates. Information culled from local police databases, such as addresses, could be more important for these more logistically intensive operations, which sometimes target homes and public spaces. \"Sanctuary policies make it hard,\" says Arnold, \"You are going to have to put more people on research and have more people waiting at the back door, so it is becoming more labor intensive.\" Liberal politicians like New York City mayor Bill De Blasio have promised to fight potential efforts by immigration authorities to access to local databases, referring specifically to New York City's municipal identification database. But law enforcement officials doubt any localities will actually move to cut off data from immigration authorities, especially when it comes to law enforcement information. \"Politicians do a lot of talking, but even if they tried to cut off databases, I'm sure ICE would find a back door,\" says Jimenez, who points out that information sharing also occurs between ICE and other federal law-enforcement agencies, who also utilize local law-enforcement data. \"Are they really going to cut off access to the FBI, the Marshalls and everyone else, just to cut off ERO? It will be impossible to do that unless they want to become an island.\" Guliani notes that the task of cutting of data flows to immigration authorities would not be easy, but that localities and states can take action by recrafting the agreements they've entered into with federal authorities. \"It's very clear that DHS is trying to implement its policies by exploiting data and trying to get its hand on as much as possible,\" says Guliani. \"So states and localities need to map out their flows of information to ICE and other components of the federal government who share with ICE, and create provisions about how this data will be used and protected so it is not used to harm undocumented communities.\" How such efforts would affect local enforcement is still up for debate. Bill Kalaf, a former director of intelligence-led policing at the Mesa Police Department, who designed the state's law enforcement database, AZLink, says such attempts would harm law enforcement's ability to conduct investigations. \"Criminals don't respect law enforcement boundaries, so why should information?\" says Kalaf, who points out that this data is crucial to investigations into gang and other criminal activity. \"I think it'd be a problem for law enforcement if people pull out their information.\" Guliani, for her part, asserts that continued local data sharing with federal immigration authorities could deter residents in immigrant communities from sharing information crucial to law enforcement. \"I don't think there is a simple solution, but for law enforcement, you don't want undocumented individuals to be afraid of calling or interacting, thinking information they give could be used for deportations,\" says Guliani.

            "article_content": "Millennials are a tough group to pin down \u2014 with their lack of landlines, refusal to answer cellphones and reluctance to respond to online surveys. But one study has managed to capture what 18- to 29-year-olds are thinking about in the current political moment, including their assessment of President Trump's first 100 days in office. Short version: They think he's doing a lousy job. Trump's approval rating among this group is an abysmal 32 percent, and 41 percent say he deserves an F for his performance thus far, according to a poll published on Tuesday by the Harvard Institute of Politics and the 33rd edition of the Public Opinion Project. The age group that Harvard surveyed fits into the millennial generation, though often \"millennials\" refers to people up to 35 years old. This generation is \"not like their parents,\" says polling director John Della Volpe. For starters, the Pew Research Center found that millennials \u2014 about 83 million strong \u2014 is more ethnically and racially diverse than any other in American history. Paul Taylor, author of The Next America, argues that unlike their Gen X or Baby Boomer (grand)parents, these young Americans have relationships with a much broader group of people. That's especially true among college students. The Harvard poll reveals some interesting connections between the kinds of people millennials know and their political leanings. For instance, Republicans are more likely than Democrats to have a close relationship with a police officer, drug addict or someone in recovery, a truck driver, veteran and a millionaire. Similarly, Democrats are more likely to be close to a Muslim person, an Ivy League graduate, or an undocumented immigrant. Regardless of party affiliation, nearly half of this behemoth group believes politics is relevant to their lives. Yet they're distrustful of government bodies, including the president and Congress. Chances they'll run for elected office before they're 50? They say 9 percent. In order to be coaxed out of their regular routine to head into a voting booth, they expect to be wooed. Students in a recent focus group at The Ohio State University in Columbus embody a few more of Volpe's findings: Clinton Supporter, Not A Democrat Like 55 percent of her peers, 20-year-old Mikayla Bodey voted for Hillary Clinton. And when asked to grade Trump, she gives him a \"D.\" But even now, she is disinclined to call herself a Democrat, which is pretty typical for a millennial \u2014 half identify as political independents, Pew has reported. She said she understands the why the two leading parties can't seem to wrap their heads around the idea that millennials aren't swayed by identity politics. Bodey is a senior, just months away from graduation. She has yet to line up a full-time job, so there's a genuine sense of urgency when she adds, \"We care about social issues a lot, but we also care about the fact that we're going have jobs when we leave school. We also care about how our parents are going to retire.\" Volpe's research over the 18 years he's conducted the poll highlights a new kind of willingness among millennials to take a sort of \"a la carte\" approach to politics. Young voters are more willing than ever to ignore conventional party lines and make decisions based on their own experience. That explains how 60 percent of voters like Bodey agree that Trump's plans to crack down on countries that engage in illegal or unfair trade practices that hurt American workers would make America better, while 45 percent say the administration's plans to \"repeal and replace\" the Affordable Care Act would make America worse. Looking For Personalization Marcus Devies' email inbox drove him crazy. In the months leading up to the November election, Devies, another Clinton supporter, said he was subject to a daily deluge of emails from the campaign. \"They were very broad, nonspecific recruiting tools,\" he said. Much to his frustration they contained \"nothing suited to The Ohio State or Columbus.\" It was annoying, but not enough to deter him from voting for Clinton. Still he shares the millennial view that political outreach efforts should be honed and tailored to the specific recipient. Essentially: To win hearts and minds, you have to learn names. This shouldn't be too surprising when one considers this is the first digital-native generation, and it has a voracious appetite for technology to match. But only a small number a millennials actually worked or volunteered for any of the campaigns. So when those emails arrived, asking for donations or some other form of help, Devies ignored and then deleted them. When asked what would have made him feel more engaged, Devies replied, \"Personalization definitely would have helped. ... I could tell it was sent with a click of button to thousands of kids.\" This ties into Volpe's broader analysis of attitudes toward trust in elected officials and the political system in general. More than half of this generation \u2014 53 percent \u2014 say elected officials don't seem to share the same priorities. They trust the president to \"do the right thing\" 24 percent of the time. (That's plummeted from 41 percent of the time in 2012, under Obama.) Pro-Trump, Anti-Fake News Republican Zach McIntyre, a freshman from a small rural town in Ohio, is one of the millennials who turned out for and continues to back Trump. A good chunk of McIntyre's high school buddies entered the military after graduation. \"There are no jobs,\" he said by way of explanation. Although, his friends are too young to be veterans, the anecdote dovetails with Volpe's research on young Republicans who are far more likely than a Democrat to know someone who's served in Iraq or Afghanistan \u2014 43 percent versus 26 percent, respectively. McIntyre also makes concerted effort to stay away from news on social media. While nearly half of millennials believes their Facebook feed is \"fake news,\" conservatives are a more inclined to hold this view. \"The constant battering of both sides is discrediting all [news outlets] in my opinion,\" he said. Drawing A Line Kyle Whitlatch, 19, is an outlier when it comes to party loyalty. Whitlatch, whose parents are both women, is reluctant to call himself a single-issue voter, but he admits he is \"as close as you can get.\" \"For me, LGBTQ rights are the end issue,\" he said. \"If you are even kind of questionable on that issue, there is no chance you'll ever win a vote of mine.\" Whitlatch's conviction on this topic and other social issue is representative of widespread millennial attitudes. Seventy-three percent of millennials support same-sex marriage, a 2015 Pew study found, including a majority of Republican and Republican-leaning millennials. On other social issues, according to the Harvard poll, more millennials agree than disagree that the government should do more to curb climate change, \"even at the expense of economic growth\"; that the government should spend more money to reduce poverty; and that recent immigration has \"done more harm than good.\" And there is even more support in those areas now than there was five years ago. The numbers on affirmative action remain low \u2014 only 19 percent approve of practices that give qualified minorities special preference in hiring and education, but that's up from only 14 percent in 2012.",

A statement released by the company said it was \"choosing to exit the modeling industry.\" \"While we enjoyed many years of success, we are focussed on our core business in the real estate and golf industries and the rapid expansion of our hospitality division,\" the statement said. Started in 1999, Trump Model Management was part of Trump's eclectic array of businesses, though it was never as visible as some of the others and didn't play a major role in the fashion business. But like other Trump businesses, it has found itself under special scrutiny as a result of Trump's decision to run for president. Despite Trump's ongoing focus on illegal immigration, several of the foreign-born models hired by the agency told reporters they had been hired despite having no work visas. \"There was about six, seven or eight of us, at least in this models' apartment. There might have been about three Americans, but the rest of us had no visa,\" Canadian-born Rachel Blais told PRI's The World. An article in Mother Jones quoted two other former models as saying the Trump agency \"never obtained work visas on their behalf, even as they performed modeling assignments in the United States.\" Trump Model Management denied using illegal labor practices. The agency also became the target of a boycott by some fashion-industry directors, makeup artists and stylists, the website Refinery29 reported in February. One of the agency's models, Maggie Rizer, said in an Instagram post the day after the election that she could no longer be associated with the Trump brand. \"I owe it to myself and to my children to proudly stand up for what I believe in and that is a world where Donald Trump has no voice for the future of our country,\" she said. Last week, The Washington Post reported that one of the agency's managers, Gabriel Ruas Santos-Rocha, had left to start his own firm called Anti Management, taking some of the models with him. He said the new agency's title was not an allusion to Trump, telling the Post, \"I did not start an agency with the intent of taking someone out of business. Outside of that I have no comments.\"",

The Justice Department is following through on an executive order to withhold as much as $4.1 billion in federal grants from so-called \"sanctuary cities,\" generally defined as places where local law enforcement limit their cooperation with federal authorities on immigration enforcement. Attorney General Jeff Sessions' appearance at the daily White House briefing is a signal that President Trump wants to move on to one of the issues he's most comfortable talking about \u2014 illegal immigration \u2014 and to shift the conversation away from health care, after his failure last week to get the GOP alternative to replace and repeal the Affordable Care Act through Congress. While there is not a set definition of a \"sanctuary\" state or city, the Justice Department gives the example of states or cities refusing immigration agents' requests to hold immigrants who came to the country illegally. Immigration and Customs Enforcement has identified 118 such jurisdictions. \"Such policies cannot continue,\" Sessions said in Monday's briefing. \"They make our nation less safe by putting dangerous criminals back on our streets.\" Sessions said that in order to receive federal funds, state and local jurisdictions must certify they are complying with federal immigration laws. In addition, Sessions said that the Justice Department will take steps to \"claw back\" grants already awarded to noncompliant cities as well. The announcement is in line with a January executive order that Trump signed shortly after taking office that directed the attorney general and the Homeland Security secretary to withhold such federal funds. Several major cities could be affected by the Justice Departments' threat, including New York City, Chicago, Los Angeles, San Francisco and Washington, D.C. After Trump's elections, mayors in those cities reaffirmed their status as sanctuary cities. After president's executive order on the issue, San Francisco sued the Trump administration over the orders, saying they violated the city's sovereignty under the 10th Amendment. Sessions on Monday pointed to crimes allegedly perpetrated by immigrants who came to the U.S. illegally as a prime reason to enforce such policies, and argued that cities who fail to do so are putting their citizens at risk. \"DUIs, assaults, burglaries, drug crimes, gang crimes, rapes, crimes against children and murders,\" the attorney general said. \"Countless Americans would be alive today \u2014 and countless loved ones would not be grieving today \u2014 if the policies of these sanctuary jurisdictions were ended.\" As the New York Times has reported, a number of studies \"have concluded that immigrants are less likely to commit crimes than people born in the United States. And experts say the available evidence does not support the idea that undocumented immigrants commit a disproportionate share of crime.\" Trump has campaigned with families whose loved ones were victims of crimes by immigrants, featuring speakers at the Republican National Convention and inviting several to his joint address to Congress last month. Opponents of such crackdowns on sanctuary cities say the order undermines the ability of localities to build trust with its citizens and protect them appropriately. \"Pressuring local law enforcement to take on immigration responsibilities undercuts the very oath they take to 'serve and protect' the entirety of their community,\" Ali Noorani, executive director of the National Immigration Forum, told NPR after Trump's January executive order. \"Smart law enforcement is built on intelligence gathering and trust, which are dramatically undermined once the cop on the corner is asking victims of crime about their immigration status.\"",

The Trump administration's talk of cracking down on undocumented immigrants has frightened many people living in the country illegally. And it has deterred some domestic abuses victims from appearing in court for fear they'll be spotted by agents from Immigration and Customs Enforcement, says Denver City Attorney Kristin Bronson. Bronson tells NPR's Rachel Martin that four women \u2014 victims of what Bronson calls physical and violent assault \u2014 have not pursued cases. \"We had pending cases that we were prosecuting on their behalf and since January 25, the date of the president's executive order [on immigration], those four women have let our office know they were not willing to proceed with the case for fear that they would be spotted in the courthouse and deported,\" Bronson says. She says the fear comes from a video taken last month that shows ICE officers waiting to make an arrest at a Denver courthouse. The video, she says, \"unfortunately has resulted in a high degree of fear and anxiety in our immigrant communities, and as a result, we have grave concerns here that they distrust the court system now and that we're not going to have continued cooperation of victims and witnesses.\" Bronson says she has asked ICE agents to stay away from the courthouse and arrest violent criminals they're after somewhere else. \"We have made that request asking them to recognize the fact that there are sensitive areas,\" she says. \"Federal guidelines from Homeland Security recognize schools and churches, hospitals as sensitive areas and we think courthouses should be recognized as well.\" Bronson clarified via email that by asking ICE not to make arrests at courthouses, the intent is not to shield violent criminals from immigration enforcement. Bronson writes, \"ICE could just as easily work through the local jail here in Denver to apprehend these individuals and avoid frightening people in our community.\" Bronson says her office had to drop the four domestic abuse cases. \"Without victims willing to testify we've had to dismiss those charges and the violent offenders have seen no consequences for their violent acts,\" she tells NPR. The video recorded in the hallway of Denver's main courthouse shows criminal defense and immigration attorney Whitney Leeds asking questions of men who tell her they're there to make an arrest. In an interview with Oregon Public Broadcasting reporter Conrad Wilson earlier this month, Leeds said ICE made arrests at courthouses during the Obama administration. She says since the 2016 election, though, she expects more arrests and more fear. \"First, because Trump's executive orders call for thousands of additional ICE agents to be hired, and secondly because he has prioritized for deportation not only any person who is here without lawful status but also any person who's ever been arrested for a crime,\" Leeds says. An ICE spokesman told NPR in a statement that while ICE does arrest people in courthouses, \"generally it's only after investigating officers have exhausted other options.\" \"In such instances where deportation officers seek to conduct an arrest at a courthouse, every effort is made to take the person into custody in a secure area, out of public view; but this is not always possible,\" according to the spokesman.

If you've been out of loop on the American contemporary art scene, the Whitney Biennial is here to catch you up. This year's show opened Friday, and features 63 different artists and many new works that have never been shown before. Some artists are responding to the most pressing issues of our time, while others are tackling mammoth projects on a tight deadline. Photographer An-My L\u00ea and artist Ra\u00fal de Nieves represent the range of this year's contributors. A Photograph That's \"Anonymous But Important\" During the Vietnam War, in the tense days before Saigon fell to the North Vietnamese, An-My L\u00ea and her family were evacuated in an American C-130. \"The American military saved my life,\" she says. \"The U.S. saved my life.\" Artist An-My L\u00ea is exhibiting photographs from 2015 and 2016 at the Biennial, including (top left) April 17, Swamp, Venice, Louisiana, (top right) November 5, Sugar Cane Field, Houma, Louisiana and (bottom) Film Set (\"Free State of Jones\"), Battle of Corinth, Bush, Louisiana.\n                \n                    \n                    An-My L\u00ea/Courtesy of The Whitney Museum\n                    \n                \nhide caption Artist An-My L\u00ea is exhibiting photographs from 2015 and 2016 at the Biennial, including (top left) April 17, Swamp, Venice, Louisiana, (top right) November 5, Sugar Cane Field, Houma, Louisiana and (bottom) Film Set (\"Free State of Jones\"), Battle of Corinth, Bush, Louisiana. Since then, war has become a preoccupation for L\u00ea. She spent years photographing the military \u2014 its uneasy soldiers, its training camps \u2014 and went back to Vietnam to shoot landscapes and portraits. More recently, L\u00ea traveled to Louisiana to take pictures of Vietnamese fishermen there. But her focus changed after the 2016 election. In her Brooklyn, New York, studio, L\u00ea points to a large photograph that she's submitted to the Whitney Biennial. It shows three men gardening in a small plot of land next to the water. She was told that they're Mexicans who work for the Vietnamese fishermen outside New Orleans. All three are wearing sweatshirts with hoods that hide their faces. She took the photo a day or two after the election. As an immigrant herself, the scene grabbed her.  \"I knew that there was something with the fact that they were somehow shrouded even though it wasn't that cold,\" she says. \"There was something anonymous but important about the way they were working.\" L\u00ea's November 9, Graffiti, New Orleans, Louisiana shows three men gardening in a small plot of land next to the water.\n                \n                    \n                    An-My L\u00ea/Courtesy of the Whitney Museum\n                    \n                \nhide caption She says that after the election, the image felt symbolic \"because of, I think, Trump's rhetoric about undocumented workers, about illegal immigrants.\" L\u00ea is drawn to subjects that are personal, but according to Gilles Peress, a photographer and colleague of L\u00ea's, the stories her pictures tell have a much wider frame. \"She doesn't stay locked into the personal experience,\" he says. \"She's able to shift from the Vietnamese community, which could be predictable from an autobiographical point of view, and turn the camera around and shoot this picture of the Mexican workers working on that garden.\" L\u00ea says that when she was younger, she would have identified with these men and their anonymity. \"Once I became an artist, I felt I had a voice, so I'm not so anonymous. But I used to feel that way, and I think many Vietnamese feel that way. And I think we're taught to not stand out.\" Clearly L\u00ea hasn't followed that advice. Fear And A Deadline Artist Ra\u00fal de Nieves made one of the largest pieces of art at this year's Whitney Biennial: a huge, mock stained-glass window that he created in just four months. Ra\u00fal De Nieves' billboard-size Biennial contribution, beginning & the end neither & the otherwise betwixt & between the end is the beginning & the end, is made from everyday material like tape, paper, glue and beads.\n                \n                    \n                    Matthew Carasella/Courtesy of The Whitney Museum\n                    \n                \nhide caption Ra\u00fal De Nieves' billboard-size Biennial contribution, beginning & the end neither & the otherwise betwixt & between the end is the beginning & the end, is made from everyday material like tape, paper, glue and beads. De Nieves makes everything by hand, from beaded sculptures to paper and glue costumes. Growing up in Michoac\u00e1n, Mexico, his mom taught him and his siblings how to crochet, and they learned how to sew in school so they could make their own clothing. Today, de Nieves makes art out of junk like tiny, plastic beads or scraps of fabric. It's tedious, time-consuming work, so he was really nervous when he met with Whitney curators to talk about what he might do for the Biennial. \"We're walking through the museum and then we get to a point where we're staring through 17-foot-tall windows,\" he recalls. \"And they're like, 'We thought you could maybe work with this.' And I was like, 'Wait, what?' \" De Nieves' Somos Monstros is also on display at the Whitney Biennial.\n                \n                    \n                    Courtesy of The Whitney Museum\n                    \n                \nhide caption De Nieves' Somos Monstros is also on display at the Whitney Biennial. De Nieves had never worked on something that big \u2014 as in billboard big. At first, he considered using machines to help him finish the project, but Whitney Biennial Curator Chris Lew nixed the idea. \"That felt a little bit outside of the way that he works,\" Lew says. So for four months, de Nieves worked by hand and non-stop. The resulting window fills the room. There's a dragon, figures dancing, green flies and white doves. It looks like cathedral-worthy stained glass, but there isn't actually any glass in it. In typical de Nieves fashion, it's made entirely from everyday material: tape, paper, glue, beads and more. Chris Lew is thrilled with the result, especially since you can see the colors from outside the building. \"It kind of announces itself before you even arrive,\" he says. And the artist is even more excited: \"When we put up the last panels ... I was like, 'Aaaaaaah!' ... I am just so happy that the challenge was there and that I said yes.\" Nothing motivates like fear and a deadline.

            "article_content": "Like most comedians, Cristela Alonzo draws upon her own experiences for her source material. That means, as a first-generation American, Alonzo has also always tackled challenging topics in her comedy. She now lives in California, but she grew up just 9 miles from the Mexico border, in San Juan, Texas. From her mom's aversion to Girl Scouts to living in the Trump era as a Mexican American, Alonzo spoke with NPR's Lulu Garcia-Navarro about how she brings elements of her hometown to life on a national stage, most recently on her Netflix special, Cristela Alonzo: Lower Classy. The Netflix trailer for the comedian's new stand-up special, Cristela Alonzo: Lower Classy \"I don't like when people try to make generalizations about people they've never met,\" she tells Lulu. Through the digestible form of stand-up, though, Alonzo attempts to break down stereotypes that inevitably go with straddling two cultures. For example, in her special, Alonzo touches on things she's had to explain to her Mexican-born mother. \"First time she saw Girl Scouts, she thought they were border patrol agents ... in training,\" Alonzo says. \"She thought border patrol had a kid unit and every time she saw the cookies she would hide from them. And I'd say 'Mom, they're not trying to deport you, they're trying to sell you cookies.' \" To which her mom would respond, \"Ah, that's what you think! That's how they get you, mija, ah, you're stupid!\" imitates Alonzo. But although that joke gets a lot of laughs, Alonzo says it reveals a difficult truth. \"In reality, my mom actually had a fear of people in uniforms because she didn't know who could deport her or not when she was becoming a resident alien. Therefore, anytime someone had a uniform she was scared.\" To listen to the full interview, click the audio link above. On her childhood on the Texas-Mexico border Even during the recession my hometown area was booming because of Mexico. Without Mexicans coming to buy our products, our economy in the United States in that area would be ruined. So my grandmother lived in Mexico, she lived in Reynosa, Tamaulipas, and we would go visit her every Monday. And a lot of my life was basically crossing over the bridge, going to Mexico, coming back. ... That's another thing that people don't understand about that area, is that it's very normal for Mexicans to come to the United States, Americans to go to Mexico, to work and then they go back to their country at the end of the day. On how her family came to live in the U.S. When [my mother] was a little kid, she lived in this village. She lived in a rancho called El Zancarron. It's in the middle of nowhere. And she saw this piece of cardboard, when she was 11 or 12 I think she's told me, and the cardboard said \"McAllen, Texas.\" And to her, it just sounded so exotic. That her goal in life to was move to McAllen, Texas. Because her village didn't have running water, didn't have electricity \u2014 nothing. She just wanted to go to a place with running water and electricity. On the long, misunderstood process of becoming a permanent legal resident My mom was undocumented in the United States for a while because the system takes so long to get your status clear that you have to become undocumented while you wait to become a resident alien. Even though she has the paperwork, she's still technically undocumented because it takes so long to get the paperwork done. It's really frustrating. ... On how the Girl Scout story exemplifies Alonzo's approach to her comedy I tell this story quite often to people because a lot of people think that immigrants come here and they take advantage of our system, they use the government programs for their benefit. And my mom actually ended up passing away very young because she refused to go to the doctor; she refused to seek any medical attention that might've been provided for by the government, because A, she didn't know what programs existed, but B, she just didn't want to take advantage, and she was actually kind of scared to use the programs [although she was entitled to as a legal resident by that point], and that's the reality for a lot of people. On whether her life has changed after the election of President Donald Trump [On a family trip to Honolulu, Hawaii, two weeks after the election,] we are going to have dinner and there's an hour wait at the restaurant we're at. My family decides to go away, and it's my oldest brother, me and my oldest nephew who is mid-20s, he's special needs. ... And these two people come up \u2014 strangers, don't know them \u2014 and they ask my brother, \"Where you from?\" And my brother, sweetest man ever, I adore this guy, says, \"I'm from Texas.\" And these two guys are like, \"Liar, you're from Mexico, go back to Mexico.\" And these guys start getting very aggressive with us. They look at my nephew, and I don't think they realize he's special needs \u2014 he's on his Nintendo. And one of the guys thinks that the Nintendo DS is a phone. And he thinks that my nephew is recording what's happening. So they come and they lunge at my nephew and try to take the Nintendo away from him, and I have to push the guy. And I tell them that they can't ever touch my nephew again. And these guys are so aggressive that I start yelling, my brother starts yelling, nobody's helping us, they're just letting everything happen and finally, the guys just decide to run away. The power that these two people felt that they had was something I never felt that I had in my life. On how she turns these tough stories into comedic material If I wanted to tell that story in my stand-up I actually tell the truth about it. But I start to break it down into certain, specific levels, like why are they like that? What kind of life do they have that they're in paradise and they can't even have fun, they can't swim with the dolphins because they look at my brother and they're like, \"That guy looks like he belongs in Mexico.\" And that's an interesting way to mock them. But you tell people what happened, so that at the end of the joke, that was the truth \u2014 that was her truth \u2014 and she made it funny. NPR's Emma Bowman contributed to this story.",

            "article_content": "There's no legal definition for a \"sanctuary city,\" but that doesn't stop people from using the term. We answer listeners' questions about what it means to be a sanctuary city.  (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) LOURDES GARCIA-NAVARRO, HOST: And this is The Call-In, a new segment where you tell us what you're thinking. Last week on the program, we heard about ICE raids happening in several cities around the country. Federal immigration authorities detained more than 600 people. One of the cities where this took place was Austin, Texas. We asked Mayor Steve Adler then what was happening in his so-called sanctuary city. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED BROADCAST) STEVE ADLER: You know, I'm not real sure what a sanctuary city is. GARCIA-NAVARRO: That got us thinking. If he's unclear about the definition of a sanctuary city, other people must have questions, too - and you did. (SOUNDBITE OF VOICE RECORDING MONTAGE) HANNAH DEFELICE: My name is Hannah DeFelice. JOHN SAUNDERS: John Saunders, and my question on sanctuary... UNIDENTIFIED MAN: And my question is... (CROSSTALK) GARCIA-NAVARRO: To answer those questions, we called up NPR's Martin Kaste, who's reported on police departments and sanctuary cities. Hi, Martin. MARTIN KASTE, BYLINE: Hi, Lulu. GARCIA-NAVARRO: OK, so you're going to be our resident expert. We have solicited questions from listeners about what it means to be a sanctuary city. And I want you to listen to this first one. CLAY HENDRIX: My name is Clay Hendrix. I live in Columbia, S.C., and my question is, how does a city actually become a sanctuary city? GARCIA-NAVARRO: So is there a legal definition? KASTE: Nope, there sure isn't. It's really branding. It's in the eye of the beholder. The term sanctuary city is used by people who like the idea as well as people who hate the idea. Both sides bandy it about, and it really doesn't - it doesn't mean anything specific. It's sort of what - the term we've started to attach to cities or counties that have sort of a general attitude toward federal enforcement agents of immigration law. But how that attitude plays out specifically can vary widely and, in fact, does vary widely. And a lot of places that call themselves sanctuary cities actually do a lot of the same things that places that don't call themselves sanctuaries do. GARCIA-NAVARRO: Well, give us some examples. What does it look like in two different cities? KASTE: Well, there's a lot of speculation about this concern that local law enforcement - police and sheriff's deputies - are going to be part of the actual process of looking for and arresting people who are in the country illegally. That almost never happens. And frankly, regardless of local politics, local police aren't interested in doing that for some very practical reasons. I mean, they - local cops don't know. They're not read into federal immigration law. The real rub here between the federal government and local law enforcement over the years has been at the jails. It's about whether or not a local jail turns people over to the immigration authorities when immigration authorities identify that there's someone sitting in county jail, maybe on a drunk driving charge or something, who's actually deportable. And over the past few years, federal immigration authorities have asked local jails to hold on to people a little bit longer so that ICE has time to get the paperwork together to come get them. And that's where they've often let people go because they don't want to get sued. GARCIA-NAVARRO: We've got a question from Hannah DeFelice in Boston. She asked... DEFELICE: ...What the loss of federal funding will mean for people living in sanctuary cities? GARCIA-NAVARRO: She's, of course, referring to President Trump's claims that he will withhold federal money from those places. KASTE: Well, we don't know which money, how much it is. There's kind of a consensus among some of the legal experts I've talked to that the Trump administration probably won't be able to just cut all federal funding to a locality. It's conceivable that what they'll do is be targeted. They'll pull money that's associated with this somehow. Perhaps it would be some money for the local jail, perhaps it would be federal grants for the local police department. It will probably be specific slices of federal money, not the whole thing. GARCIA-NAVARRO: John Saunders from Phoenix also had a question. SAUNDERS: My question is - if people seem to want local police to enforce federal immigration law, I was wondering if there were any other federal laws that local police are required to enforce? GARCIA-NAVARRO: Martin? KASTE: That's a good question. Very few, if any. There's really this doctrine of two spheres. Local law enforcement is almost never obliged to help enforce federal law. They often cooperate in that they have task forces together; They do drug enforcement together - that kind of thing. But they're not obliged to. GARCIA-NAVARRO: Another question about where the line between federal and local law enforcement lies came from Shawn Flickner in Atlanta. He says there were ICE raids there, but the city is also known as a sanctuary city. So I guess the question is - could a city stop federal officers from carrying out an immigration raid? KASTE: No. No, it - they couldn't. I mean, as far as everybody I've talked to is concerned, there's no sense that they have any legal grounds or authority to stop the federal government from enforcing federal law inside the borders of a city. GARCIA-NAVARRO: That was NPR's Martin Kaste. We also wanted to hear how police departments understand this issue. WILLIAM CITTY: I'm William Citty. I'm the police chief in Oklahoma City. GARCIA-NAVARRO: So your city is not a sanctuary city. CITTY: No, we don't consider ourselves a sanctuary city. GARCIA-NAVARRO: Let's say I am an undocumented person. I am caught speeding in a car, or I commit some sort of infraction. What happens then? I mean, what is the procedure for dealing with someone like that? CITTY: Well, the procedure would be just like any other. If they're - if we stop them on traffic and they're violating the law, then they're issued a citation. If they don't have a driver's license - and in the state of Oklahoma, if you're not documented, you can't get one - that is a concern and that's an issue. If we can't figure out and ID who the person is - and many times we will at least process them to try to identify them and then cut them loose. But in most cases, we'll write them a citation and let them go. If it's a more serious crime, like a DUI, then we will actually probably incarcerate that person. GARCIA-NAVARRO: And then let ICE know that... CITTY: The state law requires us here if it's a DUI, if it's a felony - those types of crimes - then the jail has to inquire about whether or not they're here documented or not. And then if the jail feels like they're not, then they contact ICE. And they'll let them do the rest of the investigation. But in and of itself, we don't put retainers or hold people that are undocumented. We leave that up to ICE. GARCIA-NAVARRO: There has been debate about whether \"sanctuary cities,\" quote, unquote, are safer or less safe than other cities. What is your sense of that? CITTY: Well, I mean, common sense is going to tell you if the public's not afraid to call you to report a crime, then, you know, you're going to be able to investigate that crime. We try to make sure that the Hispanic community knows that we're not going to come into a house if you report a crime and start checking to see if everybody's documented or not. That puts a lot of fear in the community. And right now, there is added fear just because of - politically and what's what's being said. And I think there's a lot of fear. It's just hard for us to overcome that. GARCIA-NAVARRO: That was Oklahoma City Police Chief William Citty.

Moriah, N.Y., is a tiny, sleepy place on the shore of Lake Champlain. Not so long ago, this was a major industrial port. Iron ore carved out of the hills here was packed onto train cars and barges. That iron ore helped build America's cities, but \"then it all came to an abrupt halt,\" Tom Scozzafava says. Scozzafava grew up in Moriah and now serves as town supervisor. He remembers the good times and he remembers the summer the good times stopped. \"1971, the miners \u2014 600 of them \u2014 went home for their annual August vacation and they were never called back,\" he says. It didn't just happen in one town or one state. Beginning after World War II and accelerating in the '70s and '80s, rural economists say much of small town America began a painful decline, shedding jobs and losing population. These are the parts of America where voters felt like Donald Trump was speaking directly to them. \"The forgotten men and women of our country will be forgotten no longer,\" President Trump said in his inaugural address. \"Rusted out factories scattered like tombstones across the landscape of our nation.\" Critics pounced on the president's language, suggesting it was too bleak, too apocalyptic. But rural policy experts like Dave Swenson say it's pretty accurate for a lot of small town America. Swenson studies rural communities and economic development for the state of Iowa. \"Two-thirds of our 99 counties [in Iowa] have posted population declines,\" Swenson says. \"Those folks have had to migrate.\" Young people moved away to the cities, main streets dried up. Swenson says people left behind feel angry, humiliated. \"What's left out in many of these places are the people that were unable to migrate, people who were unable to find new occupations or re-educate themselves into new trades,\" Swenson says. The question now is whether Trump's policies and ideas can change things, driving jobs and investment and people back to places like rural Iowa or Moriah, N.Y. Rural experts who spoke with NPR are skeptical. They say taking a tougher line with China or Mexico likely won't cause a surge of new manufacturing in small towns. \"About 65 to 80 percent of the manufacturing losses in our country are directly related to automation and technology,\" says Chuck Fluharty, who heads an organization called the Rural Policy Research Institute. Those kinds of job cuts can't be reversed by tariffs or trade deals. Fluharty says what rural America needs is an investment in what he describes as human capital, health care and education. He also says small towns need to open their doors to immigrants. \"The rural regions that will thrive in the future are the ones where that diversity is strongly expressed,\" Fluharty says. But efforts to create any kind of path to citizenship for undocumented families living in rural America seem unlikely to move forward. Rural economists say the new administration could boost some regions in the short term with big investments in infrastructure, roads and bridges. Parts of the country could also see a boom from increased oil or gas production. Still, most policy experts think the long-term trends hurting small towns \u2014 urbanization, globalization and mechanization \u2014 won't change much under President Trump. And if he can't deliver on his promise to make rural America great again, this could be one of the biggest political challenges he faces.",

Barack Obama took to the podium in the press briefing room on Wednesday, the second-to-last day of the first black presidency, and after eight years of that becoming increasingly normal, the moment made it all start to seem strange again. So this whole black leader-of-the-free-world thing really happened, huh? It wasn't that long ago that the idea of a black man in the White House was a side detail in a movie about the apocalypse, a righteous fantasy in an implausible TV thriller, or the high-concept premise of Dave Chappelle skits. And it was a while into the primaries in 2008 before even black Democrats, who had been loyal to Bill and Hillary Clinton, thought he was viable enough to take seriously. And even when they did, lots of people openly worried that to elect him was to invite his assassination. But there he was on Wednesday, a dude from the South Side of Chicago, sporting one of the sharpest caesars in the history of the planet, trying one last time to calm the nerves of a jittery, divided nation. And President Obama seemed confident that the Oval Office would not be, once again, occupied by an unbroken parade of white dudes. \"We're going to have a woman president,\" Obama said at the presser. \"We're going to have a Latino president. And we'll have a Jewish president, a Hindu president. You know, who knows who we're going to have? I suspect we'll have a whole bunch of mixed up presidents at some point that nobody really knows what to call them.\" Now, Barack Obama enters private life once more, this time as a towering historical figure. Over the last few weeks on the Code Switch podcast, we've tried to game out what has happened to race in America over the last eight years, and what Obama's presidency might mean for race relations in the future. What we heard from our guests was that race shaped both support and dissent for Obama, raised the stakes of his success, exposed the constraints of his office, and made the whiteness at the center of American politics permanently visible. All presidencies matter, but none in modern American life will have similarly animated, reflected or collided with so many of the oft-overlooked cultural and social forces at play in the country. All presidencies matter, but none in modern American life will have similarly animated, reflected or collided with so many of the oft-overlooked cultural and social forces at play in the country. Obama's faith in the inevitability of more American presidents of color was a good example of what Tressie McMillan Cottom might have called Obama's misplaced faith in white folks. Cottom, a sociologist at Virginia Commonwealth University and one our podcast guests, underlined this paradox for us: Obama's optimism about the country's capacity to overcome its racial divisions \u2014 a byproduct of his remarkable personal story \u2014 made it possible for him to be elected. But, she said, it also led him to underestimate the vehemence of the opposition to his administration, which was punctuated by U.S. Rep. Joe Wilson's (R-S.C.) 2009 outburst at a joint session of Congress. \"I still had a little bit of innocence left about how deference for the office of president could protect Barack Obama,\" she said. \"But to think that in the face of all that pageantry that you could still scream 'You lie!' and wag your finger at the president of the United States, that was probably the end of the last shred of innocence I had about how this was going to work. Then I said, 'Oh, this is going to work just like everything else works in this country.' \" What did Wilson's rude disrespect have to do with race? The architects and cheerleaders of the Republican party's policies are, with a few exceptions, white people. The voters they turn out in midterm and presidential elections are, with a few exceptions, white people. Their opposition to the president and to Democrats didn't need to be racist in order to be racialized. Those demographic facts were true long before Obama, but his presidency and the monochromatic opposition party arrayed in lockstep against him certainly seemed to cast those dynamics into sharper relief. There was no way to unsee it. Not that folks didn't try. As we pressed these issues in the podcast conversations, I kept thinking about Ray and Arlene, an older, white Montana couple my colleague Shereen Marisol Meraji interviewed in the weeks before the election. They had settled into a comfortable, middle-class retirement, so they weren't competing with anyone for jobs, and there were few immigrants, of either the documented or undocumented variety, in their virtually all-white town. Yet, they said that the dangers presented by immigrants and Muslims, and a nagging fear that the culture was changing in ways they didn't care for, was the most important issue to them. But they weren't racist, they told Shereen. And they said that they never thought about race \u2014 that America didn't have any problems with race. That was, until Obama came along and started making everything about race. That last bit, to me, seemed impossible to believe. But Whitney Dow, the creator of The Whiteness Project, told us right before the election that he wasn't surprised at all to hear someone say that. \"[When] these guys said, 'Well, I never think about race, but now, every time I look up and see the president, I have to think about race,' it's a reminder about this tension [between] how you see yourself and what you know yourself to be,\" Dow told us. He'd said he'd felt some of the same disorientation whenever he got a Christmas card with the First Family's picture on it. The family in the White House had always looked like people Ray and Arlene might ostensibly know. Now that they didn't, the whole thing caused folks like them a lot of disquiet, which they had a hard time articulating. That discomfort wasn't always so apparent. Obama was massively popular when he was sworn in in 2009; Americans, even those who didn't vote for him, seemed to be feeling good about the historic presidency \u2014 and, for some, good about themselves for feeling good about it. But there came a moment just a few months into his first term when the notion of a black man as president became real. That's when Obama waded into a minor controversy around an ugly encounter between a noted Harvard historian (and, importantly, a black guy) and a local police officer, who was white. \"I don't know, not having been there and not seeing all the facts, what role race played in that,\" Obama said. He went on: \"But I think it's fair to say, number one, any of us would be pretty angry; number two, that the Cambridge police acted stupidly in arresting somebody when there was already proof that they were in their own home; and, number three, what I think we know separate and apart from this incident is that there's a long history in this country of African-Americans and Latinos being stopped by law enforcement disproportionately. That's just a fact.\" It was a question about a dust-up that in an alternate universe a President John McCain probably wouldn't have been asked about. It was an answer that in that alternate universe President McCain certainly wouldn't have given. It was an off-the-cuff moment, but nonetheless surreal \u2014 the most powerful official in the country candidly acknowledging that capricious, unnecessary police contact was a fact of life in communities of color. And it was that moment, as Jamelle Bouie of Slate pointed out to us on the podcast, that Obama's approval rating among white Americans took a nosedive. No one knew it at the time, but the Harvard fiasco would be Obama's lowest-stakes foray into issues about race in America, and race and policing in particular. If Americans were scandalized by his remarks about that incident, it's little wonder that his responses to stories like the shooting death of Trayvon Martin would be so polarizing. \"I'm not the president of Black America,\" Obama famously said. \"I'm the president of the United States of America.\"\n                \n                    \n                    Chelsea Beck/NPR\n                    \n                \nhide caption \"I'm not the president of Black America,\" Obama famously said. \"I'm the president of the United States of America.\" The \"beer summit\" that followed was a trifle, one of those weird, facile \"conversations\" that we too often insist upon following some racial controversy. But it laid bare the tensions between the office of the presidency and the blackness of the man in it, and augured how difficult it would be for him, and for all of us, to easily reconcile those two ideas. Yep, this black presidency was really happening. If Obama's blackness mussed up white folks' notions of the presidency and their relationship to it, his blackness also complicated the ways black folks critiqued the White House. \"I'm not the president of Black America,\" Obama famously said in 2012 when pressed during his re-election campaign on issues of race and inequality. \"I'm the president of the United States of America.\" And even while his approval ratings remained extraordinarily high among black folks, those numbers belied a more complicated story. For one, he was almost certainly being judged against the alternative; the Republican brand is radioactive among black people, and so a dizzying array of black political inclinations is flatly expressed as electoral support for Democrats. That had all sorts of effects on Democratic politics. Even when black lawmakers disagreed with Obama, he was often much more popular than they were in their own districts, and by criticizing him they ran the risk of being seen like they were enabling his opponents. \"If Bill Clinton had been in the White House and had failed to address this problem, we probably would be marching on the White House,\" Emanuel Cleaver, the chair of the Congressional Black Caucus, said about black unemployment in 2011. \"There is a less-volatile reaction in the CBC because nobody wants to do anything that would empower the people who hate the president.\" Here's a thought experiment: Would the rise of the Movement for Black Lives have occurred had Obama never been president? The question gets to the matter of how much the current state of race relations in the country lies at his feet. Some months ago, Khalil Gibran Muhammad, the Harvard historian, pointed me to an idea from political theory called \"the revolution of rising expectations.\" It holds that people don't take to the streets when things are at their worst, but when things are starting to get better \u2014 just not fast enough. This idea is often used to explain the outbreak of riots among black folks in the 1960s; the passage of civil rights legislation meant that people could finally envision the prospect of equality and at the same time see that it remained distressingly out of reach. The organizers of the loosely affiliated groups commonly lumped into Black Lives Matter were mostly millennials who were invested in complicating ideas about blackness. They rejected the respectability politics that older folks like President Obama would often invoke. They explicitly interlaced their calls for racial justice with other causes: sexual orientation; gender; class. And yet, he was the first presidential candidate for whom many of these newly activated people had ever voted. Obama's presence, a sign of the gains that black folks had made in American life, had raised their expectations. It's fair to say that many of the most heated racial debates of the Obama era were neither loosed by him nor coincidental to him. \"[As] much as symbolic thresholds matter \u2014 at lower frequencies where people live \u2014 the old race and class problems of structural inequality, normalized stigma, and everyday brutalization, especially at the hands of police, persist,\" Nikhil Singh, one of our podcast guests, wrote in 2015. \"Mass protest against the impunity with which black men and women ... have been killed recently, are bringing the contradictions of the post-civil-rights era to a head. Obama does not deserve credit for this, but he is a symptom.\" In the retelling of the last eight years, we will impose upon him a simplicity that was never even close to true.\n                \n                    \n                    Richie Pope for NPR\n                    \n                \nhide caption In the retelling of the last eight years, we will impose upon him a simplicity that was never even close to true. So what will Obama mean to Americans and race going forward? Here are some wild prognostications of my own, since you asked: Outside of the strictures of the White House, Obama will become more pointed about issues of racial justice. He will probably travel a similar trajectory to once-polarizing black figures like Martin Luther King Jr. and Muhammad Ali, both of whom became more beloved, particularly by white Americans, as the details of their battles against justice receded from memory. (Like them, Obama will then be held up as both an example of black excellence \u2014 and when useful, invoked as a cudgel.) And in the retelling of the last eight years, we will impose upon him a simplicity that was never even close to true. In the near-term, I can't help thinking about that saying the old folks have: You have to be twice as good and run twice as fast to get half as far. That's either a lament about the drag of racism on black life or a clear-eyed set of instructions on how to deal with it, depending on who's saying it and when. Obama got very, very far, very, very fast \u2014 farther than all but a few dozen white men in the history of the republic. Everyone in that cohort arrived with a tremendous amount of self-regard, literal and political capital, and exceedingly good fortune. Shortly after Donald Trump's election, a friend joked that the \"twice as good\" maxim had been based on extremely conservative arithmetic. There's no way a black candidate with Trump's temperament or backstory, no matter how exponentially better he or she was, could be a credible candidate for national office. Perhaps. It's also probably true that no black candidate without Barack Obama's specific temperament and backstory could have been a credible candidate for the nation's highest office. Looking back with us on the podcast, Jamelle Bouie of Slate wondered if, when it came down to it, the only person who could have been the first black president of the United States was Barack Obama. And still, his patriotism was questioned. His citizenship was questioned. The litigation of his legitimacy \u2014 of his Americanness \u2014 in the end, may have been the blackest thing about the first black presidency. \"Putting Obama's politics aside ... he is an Ivy-League educated constitutional lawyer, who seems to be a moral and upright American example in every way you can imagine,\" Bouie told Shereen and me. \"If Barack Obama isn't good enough for some of these people, then none of us are.\"",

The 20-year-old is in his last semester as a political science major at Virginia Tech. All Things Considered co-host Ari Shapiro is on a road trip leading up to the inauguration of Donald Trump on Jan. 20. He is driving through North Carolina and Virginia, on the way to Washington, D.C. These are two swing states that went in opposite directions in November, each by a close margin: North Carolina for Trump, Virginia for Hillary Clinton. As the country faces dramatic changes, we're asking people what they want from that change \u2014 and what concerns them. Juan de la Rosa Diaz did not actually vote \u2014 even though he has a lot riding on the outcome of the 2016 presidential election. He is in his last year as a political science major at Virginia Tech in Blacksburg, Va., and on a recent day, the 20-year-old is proudly wearing a T-shirt that says, \"I am undocumented.\" Juan came to the U.S. from Mexico with his parents when he was 5 years old. He has sisters who were born here; they're American citizens. Juan always knew he was undocumented, and that he had to keep it a secret, but he only really understood what it meant when he turned 16 and all of his friends started getting driver's licenses. \"For all of high school, all of my friends just thought I was a really bad driver, and that's why I didn't have a license,\" he says. \"When you're undocumented, you get really good at lying, all these little white lies that you use to build a barrier that protects you and your family. It's not only my secret, it's my family's secret.\" In 2012, President Obama signed an executive action that changed things for Juan. The Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, or DACA, meant that he didn't have to lie anymore, and could get a driver's license and permission to work. Juan went to college, with plans to get a doctorate degree and become a university professor. Donald Trump campaigned on undoing all of that, and Juan worries about what a Trump presidency means not only for himself and his education, but of that of other DACA students. Despite his fears and feelings of betrayal, though, Juan says he still feels a strong connection to the United States. \"I very much consider myself woven into the fabric of this country, because it's taught me everything I know, it's given me so many opportunities,\" he says.

Unlike President-elect Trump, he expressed strong support for the NATO alliance. The first of President-elect Donald Trump's nominees headed to Capitol Hill this week to begin their Senate confirmations. And while there were some tense moments and stumbles, overall his Cabinet picks were well-received, and most should get quick confirmations as soon as Trump is sworn in next week. But the major theme that emerged in committee hearings was that some of the president-elect's top would-be advisers revealed some major policy breaks with the future president on issues Trump championed and views he expressed on the campaign trail \u2014 from Russian hacking, torture, a Muslim ban and registry, mosque surveillance, NATO, the Iran nuclear deal, even infrastructure, deportations and that border wall. It demonstrates the potential constraints the president-elect could run into if he seeks to implement some of the more provocative aspects of what he campaigned on. But it also raises questions of just how much Trump actually meant what he said when he campaigned and about the breadth of discussions he has had with his Cabinet picks on critical policy points. That lack of cohesion could lead to friction in the near future and potential difficulty governing \u2014 if the nominees carry their beliefs forward in their roles in the administration. The views, tempered or opposite of Trump's, could also be a reflection of just how difficult it would be otherwise for a nominee to be confirmed by the U.S. Senate, espousing the kinds of boastful campaign opinions the president-elect has expressed. Because there were so many, here's a quick recap, all in one place, of this past week's hearings: Attorney general nominee Jeff Sessions The Alabama senator had the most exhaustive confirmation hearing of the week, stretching into two days. NPR's Meg Anderson had a recap: \"Democrats don't have the votes to stop Sessions' appointment. Perhaps as a result, they focused primarily on fleshing out what Sessions' relationship would be with the president as attorney general and reminded him of the importance of an independent Justice Department. Sessions spent a lot of the day reassuring his colleagues that he would follow the law, first and foremost, and expressing his disagreements with some of the president-elect's more extreme proposals.\" Sessions said he opposed bringing back waterboarding as an extreme interrogation technique, and he also said that he opposed other Trump campaign proposals of banning Muslims from coming into the U.S. amid terrorism concerns and also said he opposed any type of registry of Muslims either. \"And I think we should avoid surveillance of religious institutions unless there's a basis to believe that dangerous or threatening illegal activity could be carried on there,\" he added. Sessions' record on race was a key focus, 30 years after his hopes of a federal judgeship were scuttled by the same committee over allegations he had used racist language as a U.S. Attorney. Sessions denied those allegations, reiterating that, \"I did not harbor the kind of animosities and race-based discrimination ideas I was accused of. I did not.\" But that didn't stop some of Sessions' colleagues from taking an unprecedented step in testifying against his confirmation. Sen. Cory Booker, D-N.J., the first sitting senator to testify against a fellow senator during a confirmation hearing, said Sessions' record \"indicates that we cannot count on him to support state and national efforts toward bringing justice to the justice system.\" And Rep. John Lewis, D-Ga., a venerated civil-rights leader who marched with Martin Luther King Jr., told the Judiciary Committee that \"Those who are committed to equal justice in our society wonder whether Sen. Sessions' calls for law and order will mean today what it meant in Alabama when I was coming up back then.\" Secretary of State nominee Rex Tillerson The former Exxon Mobil CEO's confirmation hearing was the roughest of the week. He faced grilling from members of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee over his close ties with Russia and its president, Vladimir Putin, along with questions about lobbying and deal-making during his four decades with the oil giant. Tillerson faced particularly aggressive questioning from Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., a former Trump primary opponent. Rubio pushed the would-be chief diplomat on whether he would label Putin as a war criminal, while Tillerson dodged. He also pressed Tillerson on his views on human-rights violations in the Philippines and Saudi Arabia, and Rubio was flabbergasted when Tillerson said he'd need more information to make such pronouncements despite widely available documentation of atrocities in both countries. Rubio hasn't said yet whether he will support Tillerson's nomination, which could be a major complication for his confirmation. Tillerson was also tripped up over his tenure at Exxon Mobil and whether the country had lobbied against Russian sanctions. He initially said he had no knowledge that the company had ever \"directly lobbied,\" to which even a supportive Chairman Bob Corker, R-Tenn., interjected that Tillerson had even called him about the sanctions at the time. Tillerson also claimed he didn't recall whether Exxon Mobil had done business with Iran, Syria and Sudan during his tenure. But Tillerson did express some differences with Trump on key issues. He began by sounding a more hawkish tone toward Russia, and said he believes intelligence reports that the country was involved in cyberattacks designed to influence the U.S. elections. He also said he opposed a potential ban on Muslims coming into the U.S. and any type of Muslim registry, either. Tillerson also said he supported the Trans-Pacific Partnership trade deal, which Trump has loudly opposed and pledged to abandon. Defense Secretary nominee James Mattis Trump's choice to lead the Pentagon also struck a very different tone from the president-elect on foreign policy, testifying Thursday that Russia was a major threat to the U.S. \"I'm all for engagement,\" Mattis said, \"but we also have to recognize reality in terms of what Russia is up to.\" And the retired four-star Marine Corps general also reiterated his strong support for NATO, an alliance Trump openly questioned and doubted on the campaign trail. Mattis said he believed Trump was \"open\" on the issue and understood his steadfast position. \"My view is that nations with allies thrive, and nations without allies don't,\" Mattis said, calling it \"the most successful military alliance probably in modern world history, maybe ever.\" Mattis also expressed acceptance of the Iran nuclear deal and said he believed it was likely workable. Trump has been hotly critical of the deal and has threatened to pull out of it. Senate and House committees, along with the full Senate, also approved a waiver to allow Mattis to serve as defense secretary. He only retired in 2013, while current law requires a wait of seven years to serve in that position. Homeland Security Secretary nominee John Kelly Kelly, a retired Marine Corps general, also broke with Trump on several key points during his Tuesday confirmation hearing before the Senate Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs. On Trump's seminal campaign promise, to build a wall along the Mexican border, Kelly acknowledged that \"a physical barrier in and of itself will not do the job. It has to be a layered defense\" of human patrols, drones and other sensors. On the administration's deportation policies, Kelly also broke with Trump, saying that undocumented children who are part of the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program would \"probably not be at the top of the list\" and that he would \"keep an open mind.\" The former head of the U.S. Southern Command also repeatedly stressed working with other Latin American countries to better curtail drug and human trafficking. Kelly also said he opposed reinstating waterboarding and also said he had \"high confidence\" in U.S. intelligence findings on Russian attacks on the elections. And Kelly said he opposed any kind of surveillance on mosques or any creation of a Muslim database, testifying that, \"I don't think it's ever appropriate to focus on something like religion as the only factor\" when looking to prevent terrorism. CIA Director nominee Mike Pompeo The Kansas GOP congressman Trump has chosen to lead the intelligence department also broke with the president-elect, opposing waterboarding as a form of torture. In this hearing, in which the power was lost and the C-SPAN camera feed went down (just as they were talking about Russia), Pompeo also said he had confidence in the current U.S. intelligence program and said he agreed with their findings that Russia had tried to meddle in the elections, again putting him at odds with the man he would serve, NBC News reported: \"In his opening remarks, Pompeo took aim at Russia, saying that Moscow has 'reasserted itself aggressively, invading and occupying Ukraine, threatening Europe and doing nothing to aid in the defeat of ISIS.' \"He later said, 'It's pretty clear about what took place here about Russia involvement in efforts to hack information and to have an impact on American democracy.'\" Housing and Urban Development Secretary nominee Ben Carson In the former famed neurosurgeon's confirmation, it was a question of whether Carson had enough experience dealing with housing issues to lead the agency. He got a warm reception though before the Senate Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs Committee on Thursday. He told them that he wanted to oversee HUD because it's not just \"putting roofs over the heads of poor people, it has the ability to be so much more than that.\" Carson said he wants to use his role to to take \"a holistic approach\" to help \"develop our fellow human beings.\" NPR's Brian Naylor reports Carson also \"would not say that housing properties owned by Trump won't benefit from HUD programs\" in a tense exchange with Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass.: \"Carson responded it would not be his intention 'to do anything to benefit any American,' quickly adding that anything the department does 'is for all Americans.' Carson said, 'If there happens to be an extraordinarily good program that's working for millions of people, and it turns out that someone that you're targeting is going to gain, you know, $10 from it, am I going to say 'no'?' Carson asked. 'Logic and common sense probably would be the best way.' \"Trump's family made its fortune in real estate, and it still owns some rental properties in New York. Trump has refused to divest his assets, and Warren, who tangled with Trump during the campaign, charged the president-elect is 'hiding his family's business interests from you, from me, from the rest of America.' \"In a later exchange, Carson said he would report to lawmakers on any dealings HUD has with properties owned by Trump or his family.\" Transportation Secretary nominee Elaine Chao The AP described Chao's confirmation hearing as a \"lovefest,\" which was a pretty accurate characterization. Yes, the former labor secretary in the George W. Bush administration had already been confirmed before and has a long resume that makes her qualified for the position, but the fact that she's the wife of Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell didn't hurt, either. NPR's David Schaper reported that Chao talked about the \"bold vision\" Trump has to rebuild the country's crumbling infrastructure, but acknowledged that \"the government doesn't have the resources to do it all.\" What's next? Two planned confirmation hearings for this past week were postponed. Education Secretary nominee Betsy DeVos will now testify Tuesday amid concerns over an incomplete ethics review and financial disclosures. The Senate Committee on Health Education Labor and Pensions said the delay was \"at the request of Senate leadership to accommodate Senate schedule.\" Rep. Ryan Zinke, R-Mont., Trump's nominee for interior secretary, will also have his confirmation hearing Tuesday. On Wednesday, a key hearing sure to garner lots of attention \u2014 Trump's nominee to head the Environmental Protection Agency, Oklahoma Attorney General Scott Pruitt, will have his confirmation hearing. Commerce Secretary nominee Wilbur Ross also saw his confirmation hearing delayed, pushed to Wednesday, also amid a paperwork delay. And on Thursday, Rick Perry testifies to convince senators why he should lead one of the three agencies he said he wanted to eliminate during his 2012 presidential run, the Energy Department.",

They worry about their rights as LGBT people, but more so, they worry for others more vulnerable than themselves, especially Muslims and people who are in the country illegally. This story is part of Kitchen Table Conversations, a series from NPR's National Desk that examines how Americans from all walks of life are moving forward from the presidential election. The election of Donald Trump has many LGBT people worried that recent civil rights strides will be erased. In Phoenix, three people \u2014 two middle-aged gay men and a young genderqueer woman \u2014 meet for the first as part of NPR's Kitchen Table Conversation series, brought together by their fears for the future. While Donald Trump has called himself a supporter of the LGBT community, many of his Cabinet picks \u2013 and his vice president \u2013 oppose LGBT rights. Moya \u2014 who is 52, gay, Latino and married \u2014 thinks Trump's opinions can turn on a dime. So even though the president-elect has said he's \"fine\" with the U.S. Supreme Court legalizing same-sex marriage, Moya says he doesn't believe it. \"I don't know what's going to happen,\" he says. That uncertainty has Moya, Brendan Mahoney and Jenni Vega worried. They believe Trump has invigorated people who don't want to understand them \u2013 and might even hate them. Mahoney is a 59-year-old gay white man who's been out since he was 19, while Vega is a genderqueer Hispanic woman. And their worry isn't only for themselves, but for other people who are even more vulnerable: trans people, Muslims, those who are in the country illegally.

John Kelly is sworn in before his confirmation hearing in front of the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee to run the Department of Homeland Security on Tuesday. Updated at 8 p.m. ET Donald Trump's nominee to lead the Department of Homeland Security, retired Marine Corps Gen. John Kelly, broke with the president-elect on many of his key campaign promises on immigration during his confirmation hearing on Tuesday, including a border wall, Muslims coming into the U.S. and torture techniques. The former head of the U.S. Southern Command, Kelly agreed with a question from Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., over the strategy to defend the country's southern border, both from immigrants crossing into the U.S. illegally and from drug traffickers, saying that a border wall would not be enough. \"A physical barrier in and of itself will not do the job. It has to be a layered defense,\" Kelly said, calling for more human patrols and assistance from drones and other sensors. Kelly also stressed the need to work with other Latin American countries to forge better relationships to stop drug trafficking. Kelly agreed with McCain that waterboarding should continue to be prohibited and that the Geneva Conventions should be followed. \"I don't think we should ever come close to crossing a line that is beyond what we as Americans would expect to follow in terms of interrogation techniques,\" Kelly said. During the campaign, Trump pledged that he would bring back the controversial form of torture in order to fight terrorism. Kelly also said he had \"high confidence\" in U.S. intelligence reports that found that Russia had engaged in cyberattacks in order to influence the U.S. elections. Trump has cast doubt on those findings. Pressed by Sen. Gary Peters, D-Mich., on whether it was lawful to conduct surveillance on mosques or create a database of Muslims in the U.S., Kelly agreed that would violate the Constitution. \"I don't think it's ever appropriate to focus on something like religion as the only factor,\" Kelly said. The Department of Homeland Security is a sprawling enterprise, with a budget of some $40 billion and a quarter-million employees. Its responsibilities encompass everything from natural disasters (FEMA), to airport security (TSA), presidential security (U.S. Secret Service), the Coast Guard and cybersecurity. DHS agencies are also responsible for defending the nation's borders and overseeing the immigration system. It's those areas that are most in the sights of the incoming president, who has called for measures including a wall along the U.S. border with Mexico, the deportation of millions of undocumented immigrants currently in the U.S. and \"extreme vetting\" of immigrants wishing to enter the country. Trump said on the campaign trail that screening should be focused on those coming from \"some of the most dangerous and volatile regions of the world that have a history of exporting terrorism.\" Those comments were an adaptation of the ban on Muslims entering the U.S. that Trump had proposed at the end of 2015. Asked by Sen. Kamala Harris, D-Calif., about deportation priorities, Kelly suggested that undocumented children who are part of the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program would \"probably not be at the top of the list\" and that he would \"keep an open mind.\" Kelly said that the incoming administration's immigration policy is still \"ongoing,\" but that he has \"not been involved in those discussions.\" Overall, Kelly was well-received by both Republicans and Democrats during his testimony before the Senate Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs. Ranking member Claire McCaskill, D-Mo., praised him during her opening statement and later tweeted that he was a \"good choice\" to lead DHS. Kelly was introduced by McCain, Democratic Sen. Tom Carper of Delaware, and former Defense Secretary Robert Gates, who served in both the Bush and Obama administrations. Kelly was an adviser to Gates at the Pentagon. Gates praised Kelly, calling him \"one of the finest people I have ever known,\" also saying, \"I would trust him with my life.\" The 66-year-old Kelly had appeared before lawmakers before, in his role as head of the U.S. Southern Command, which is responsible for military matters in the Caribbean, Central and South America. Kelly's nomination is unlikely to be met with much opposition, and the questions on the committee bore that out. He has built up relationships with lawmakers who respect his service and his sacrifice. (Kelly lost a son to combat in Afghanistan.)",

Staffers want to know about the use of fake accounts, bots and trolls to influence the trends and topics on the social platform. The presidential election is long past, but online attacks aimed at shaping the U.S. information environment have kept right on coming. This week brought a slate of fresh examples of ways in which users \u2014 some of them demonstrably Russian, others not \u2014 continue to try to use Facebook, Twitter and other platforms to jam a crowbar into existing American political divisions and wrench them further apart. Oklahoma's Republican Sen. James Lankford cited the ongoing national debate over free speech and protest in the National Football League, which has set players who want to call attention to police brutality \u2014 and are demonstrating by kneeling during the national anthem \u2014 against President Trump and cultural conservatives. \"We watched, even this weekend, the Russians and their troll farms, their Internet folks, start hashtagging out 'take a knee' and also hashtagging out 'boycott the NFL,' \" Lankford said at a hearing of the Senate Homeland Security Committee on Wednesday. \"They were taking both sides of the argument this past weekend and pushing them out from their troll farms as much as they could to just raise the noise level in America and make a big issue seem like an even bigger issue as they're trying to push divisiveness in the country,\" he said. That's the very same modus operandi that Senate Intelligence Committee investigators and others have detected in Russian influence-mongers' use of Facebook last year. Moscow's intelligence agencies not only used secret cyberattacks to steal and leak information, as the U.S. intelligence community concluded. The Russians also openly bought ads on Facebook aimed at amplifying the most controversial issues in American political life \u2014 including abortion, guns and LGBT issues \u2014 and used fake accounts to spread disinformation and even organize real-life rallies. Facebook ads connected to Russian influence operations also supported Green Party candidate Jill Stein, Democratic Party challenger Bernie Sanders and Trump himself, Politico reported. Facebook has denied it was aware that anything like this was taking place at the time. The company is turning over the content of about 3,000 Russian-linked ads to Congress and participating in the ongoing investigations into the election interference. But Facebook has also acknowledged that as it investigates the way its network was used last year, it could find more examples of influence attacks. Facebook's head of product policy and counterterrorism, Monika Bickert, said on Wednesday that the network's current practices offer a \"powerful tool\" for combating influence operations: requiring joiners to use their real names. \"That means that if you set up a Facebook account and you use 'Mickey Mouse' as your name, we will try to detect that and certainly, if it's reported to us, we will look to see if that's your real name,\" Bickert said at an event in Washington. \"We may ask you for identification. And if we determine that the account is fake, we will remove it. ... The ads that we've been talking about, the reason that we removed those was because they were coming from inauthentic accounts,\" she said. The House and Senate Intelligence Committees both have convened hearings next month at which members are expected to ask representatives from Facebook, Twitter and Google about the influence operations. Twitter officials also are expected to meet with Senate Intelligence Committee investigators behind closed doors on Thursday. Staffers want to know about the use of the \"hashtagging\" that Lankford described, as well as the use of fake accounts, bots and trolls, to influence the trends and topics on Twitter. This strategy isn't new. \"Russia, like its Soviet predecessor, has a history of conducting covert influence campaigns focused on US presidential elections that have used intelligence officers and agents and press placements to disparage candidates perceived as hostile to the Kremlin,\" the U.S. intelligence report said. But what is new, as Director of National Intelligence Dan Coats and other leaders have told Congress, is the intensity of the operations and their breadth across the Internet. They're so broad, in fact, they're aimed across the West. Russian influence-mongers also targeted Germany's recent election with an attempt to boost the results of an alternative, anti-immigrant party. In another example, NPR found a troubling pattern in Facebook comments that appeared in response to its own news stories about Germany, including the recent presidential elections and the country's influx of refugees. Those postings drew immediate floods of angry comments about immigrants, Syrians and how they are \"ruining\" Germany. Many commenters returned to reply multiple times to the same threads, working the social network's system for elevating certain comments to the most visible positions. \"I will never visit Germany again,\" writes one commenter on a recent NPR post. \"Many of my friends don't want to go either. Hundreds of YouTube videos showing the violence.\" \"Millions and millions of men from violent third world cultures which do not know democracy \u2014 well, this is not going to end well,\" the same commenters wrote in a long reply thread. While it's not uncommon to see vigorous debate among NPR's followers, an NPR editor discovered that many of the posts came from suspicious accounts \u2014 ones that showed their users had no friends, no photos, no personal posts or the other normal characteristics. NPR reported the accounts to Facebook, whose administrators took down many of the comments. NPR receives some financial support from Facebook to provide video content on the site. So, in fact, do nearly all other big news organizations in the United States. Facebook reaches about 68 percent of U.S. adults and has become one of the single most important purveyors of information from news organizations \u2014 just some of the reasons why it has attracted so much attention in the aftermath of the election interference. Facebook was always anti-Trump.The Networks were always anti-Trump hence,Fake News, @nytimes(apologized) & @WaPo were anti-Trump. Collusion? Former President Barack Obama thought the problem so serious he took aside Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg last year to prod him about how seriously to take the spread of disinformation, The Washington Post reported. Obama's successor also appreciates the magnitude of the social network: Trump used his own favorite channel, Twitter, to pile on against Facebook on Wednesday by accusing it of being \"anti-Trump.\" The post may also have been a reference to accusations by conservatives that they felt Facebook was suppressing their viewpoints, a complaint Zuckerberg took seriously enough to host a delegation last year that included the commentator Glenn Beck. Or it may have been an allusion to the power that Facebook, per Trump, imparts to news organizations he considers hostile, making the service itself just as much of a problem from his perspective. Members of Congress, led by the Intelligence Committee's vice chairman, Sen. Mark Warner, D-Va., have broached the idea of new requirements for Facebook. That could include restrictions on the sales of ads to foreigners or at least more disclosure about the purchasers. Lankford, on Wednesday, didn't address those questions in detail \u2014 but he didn't appear confident that anything might change influence operations soon. \"We've continued to be able to see that,\" he said. \"We will see that again at our election time.\" NPR's Ryan Lucas and L. Carol Ritchie contributed to this report.",

German media characterized the results of Sunday's vote as a major shift. Der Spiegel reports, AfD is the \"first overtly right-wing party to win seats in the country's federal parliament in over half a century.\" With around 33 percent of the vote, Merkel's Christian Democratic Union party came in first in Sunday's vote, but it was its worst showing since 1949. \"Of course we would have preferred a better result,\" Merkel said, according to The Associated Press. But she observed that her party has been in power for the past dozen years, the last four of which have been \"extremely challenging.\" The CDU is projected to hold 218 seats out of the Bundestag's 631 total. Merkel's outgoing coalition partner, the Social Democrats, received just 20 percent of the vote, its worst showing ever. But it was enough for a second place result of 138 seats in parliament, according to early results. \"Today is a difficult and bitter day,\" said SPD leader Martin Schulz, who had hoped to take the chancellorship from Merkel. Schulz announced that he will not partner in another grand coalition and that his party will go into opposition. The so-called Jamaica coalition, which would see Merkel ruling together with the Greens and the liberal Free Democrats, is her likeliest path toward a majority in parliament. The coalition is so named because the parties' colors of green, yellow and black mirror the Jamaican flag. The AfD came in third Sunday, with early results showing it received more than 13 percent of the vote. The xenophobic party ran on an anti-immigrant platform with an emphasis on closing Germany's borders to migrants. It had been fiercely opposed to Merkel's recent welcoming of large numbers of refugees. In the runup to the election, NPR's Soraya Sarhaddi Nelson reports German voters were inundated with campaign posters, including ones from the anti-Muslim AfD party with the blunt slogan: \"Burkas? We prefer bikinis.\" AfD's co-leader Alexander Gauland vowed Sunday that the party would \"change this country,\" promising to pursue Germany's established parties. \"We will hunt Ms. Merkel. We will bring back our nation,\" Gauland said. The AfD is expected to hold some 87 seats in parliament. Merkel told supporters Sunday that \"we want to win back AfD voters\" by solving the country's problems and addressing their concerns, reports AP. She said Germany has to take the fears of its people seriously. The final election results are expected early Monday, German time, but are not expected to deviate greatly from Sunday's projections.",

A liberal human rights lawyer born to North Korean refugees has won South Korea's presidential election with a promise to improve the economy and hold talks with the nuclear-armed North. Moon Jae-in, 64, of the Democratic Party, is a former student protester, special forces soldier and presidential aide. He has promised to add public sector jobs, engage Pyongyang in dialogue and rethink South Korea's close relations with the United States. Moon had a strong lead of more than 41 percent of the vote among a field of 13 candidates, according to unofficial exit polls conducted by South Korean media. His closest contenders \u2014 a far-right conservative and a centrist \u2014 have conceded defeat. Election officials confirmed Moon's victory early Wednesday morning local time (Tuesday afternoon ET). Moon is most closely associated with the left-wing politics of another South Korean president, Roh Moo-hyun, who served from 2003 to 2008 and committed suicide in 2009 amid a family corruption scandal. Moon was Roh's chief of staff, law partner and best friend and is expected to revive his so-called Sunshine Policy of dialogue and economic aid to North Korea. But while North Korea's burgeoning nuclear program grabs headlines abroad, many South Koreans said the election issues most important to them are domestic: sluggish economic growth, soaring youth unemployment, corruption and air pollution. Moon's victory was in a special by-election to replace former President Park Geun-hye, who was impeached late last year and removed from office in March. Last week, she went on trial in Seoul for corruption; if convicted, she could spend life in prison. The head of the country's largest conglomerate, Samsung, has also been indicted. \"I want the next president to make sure Park faces punishment,\" said accountant Kim Il-young, 26, outside a polling station Tuesday in Seoul. \"Politicians, even if they're convicted, sometimes get pardoned easily and are punished much less severely than average citizens.\" Once official results confirm his win, Moon is expected to make a victory speech in a central district of Seoul that has been the makeshift base for protesters calling for Park's ouster. Throughout his campaign, Moon has spoken figuratively of moving the base of power out of South Korea's version of the White House and into those squares where protesters gathered. While campaigning, several presidential candidates said they would consider pardoning Park, but Moon has said he refuses to do so. He lost the 2012 presidential election to Park but got support in this election from her critics, many of them younger voters. Under Moon, South Korea is expected to reach out to North Korea, but analysts warn not to expect immediate talks. \"He will push for an inter-Korean summit meeting, but this will only come after a meeting with President Trump,\" says political scientist Kim Hong-guk, a professor at South Korea's Kyonggi University. \"At this point, communication between the two Koreas is completely cut off, which is why he would focus on improving the situation and gathering momentum, such as discussing ways to reopen the Kaesong industrial complex.\" That's a joint industrial facility where tens of thousands of North and South Koreans work together just north of the Demilitarized Zone that separates the two countries. It has been closed for more than a year. Moon has proposed reopening it. North Korea, for its part, called on the eve of the South Korean election for an \"end to conflict\" between the two Koreas and the start of \"a new era of reunification.\"",

Disagreements over immigration policy could flare when German Chancellor Angela Merkel visits the White House later this week. In just the past two years, more than 1 million refugees \u2014 many of them Syrians \u2014 have inundated Germany as Merkel opened Germany's borders. President Trump called that policy \"catastrophic.\" In fact, integrating refugees into German society has become a challenge for Merkel as she seeks re-election. When the wave of refugees first surged into Germany there was lots of talk that they might be the answer to the country's declining population and big worker shortage. But the mood soured after the assaults by male refugees on women during New Year's Eve celebrations just over a year ago. It darkened further following the attack on a Berlin Christmas market by a Tunisian refugee three months ago. Waiting for an interview Those incidents raised even more hurdles for 27-year-old Akhlaq Hussain. A math teacher in his former life, he fled to Germany from Pakistan after he and his school received threats of kidnapping and death from the Taliban. Akhlaq Hussain fled to Germany from Pakistan after he and his school received threats of kidnapping and death from the Taliban.\n                \n                    \n                    John Ydstie/NPR\n                    \n                \nhide caption Akhlaq Hussain fled to Germany from Pakistan after he and his school received threats of kidnapping and death from the Taliban. \"They demand some money. If we pay monies then childrens will be free,\" Hussain says. \"If we don't pay monies, they kill the peoples and childrens and cut the head, you know, they say 'Allahu Akbar.' \" But a year and a half after a harrowing journey, much of it on foot, crossing mountainous borders and being beaten by police in Bulgaria, Hussain is stuck in refugee housing in Neuss, a German town across the Rhine River from Duesseldorf. Hussain says he has been treated well at the local refugee center, even though the self-service kitchen needs renovation and the bathrooms need work. He has spent more than a year and a half here waiting just to get an asylum interview. In the meantime, there's not much to do except chores like vacuuming the carpets in the room he shares with another refugee. Refugee from the wrong country Hussain's big problem is that he is Pakistani. Germany doesn't recognize Pakistan as a country dangerous enough for its citizens to automatically receive asylum. As a result, few social services are available to him. Some local volunteers, like Ilona Valero, have been providing some aid. \"I try to help with all the papers. In Germany there are a lot of papers,\" she says with a resigned laugh. \"They are waiting such a long time. There is no structure in the day. They're waiting for German lessons. They're waiting for permission to stay and permission to work.\" Recently the volunteers have managed to get temporary jobs for a few refugees, including work at a garden center for Hussain. It will help him pass the time while he awaits an asylum decision. But his odds are not good \u2014 during the past two years fewer than 10 percent of Pakistanis seeking asylum in Germany were successful. Language versus alienation Thirty miles up the Rhine River, in Cologne, refugees, most of them Syrians, sit in a classroom with the hum of traffic and fresh air flowing through an open window. They're absorbing information about German laws and customs at an integration center in a new high-rise office building. Karim Khayal, a counselor here, says the key to success for refugees is learning German. \"There is no integration without language.\" He says that's something the refugees have internalized. Khayal says they know that language is the No. 1 requirement and they understand that \"speaking efficient German means having arrived in Germany.\" And there's a lot at stake, Khayal says. He points to Germany's experience with Turkish guest workers starting in the 1960s. The government failed to integrate them into German society, and there continues to be alienation in that community \u2014 which now numbers 3 million. Khayal says the danger is very real that \"if we don't take care now, we're going to have a larger group of alienated young men \u2014 men who are angry, who are bitter, who are both distant to their country of origin and distant to their new home country and who are going to, of course, have radical ideas.\" Integrating successfully Thirty-three-year-old Ibrahim Habib, a refugee from Syria, appears to be well on his way to successful integration. He was at the center meeting with Khayal. In Damascus, Habib designed and cut clothing. He says that job is out of reach in Germany, so he wants be a bicycle mechanic. Ibrahim Habib is a refugee from Syria, where he designed and cut clothing. Now, he hopes to be a bicycle mechanic.\n                \n                    \n                    John Ydstie/NPR\n                    \n                \nhide caption Ibrahim Habib is a refugee from Syria, where he designed and cut clothing. Now, he hopes to be a bicycle mechanic. Like nearly all Syrian refugees, Habib has been granted asylum. That makes him eligible for government support while he learns German and gets job training. Habib says Germany is home now and he wants to be a German in the future. \"The past life is gone,\" he says, \"and seeing the respect you got from the German society only means that you have to give this respect back, and want to be part of this society \u2014 not go back to your Syrian past.\" But with language and integration courses, plus an apprenticeship, it could still be years before Habib is fully employed. Christoph Moeller, until recently chief spokesman for the German Employment Agency, estimates it could take six years for Germany to fully integrate this wave of refugees into the workforce. \"It's a long journey and it's going to be an expensive journey,\" says Moeller, \"but in the end for society these costs are actually justified, because the costs in not doing anything will be much higher.\" In the past year around 40,000 refugees found jobs in Germany. Meanwhile, close to half a million are seeking employment, but they need language and vocational training first. One modest success story Solomon Yhdego is one refugee who has found a job. He works 20 hours a week in a vast Deutsche Post/DHL sorting facility in Duisburg. He makes about $12 an hour moving big yellow boxes of mail onto metal racks for delivery. Yhdego, who's 31, easily gained asylum in Germany after escaping from Eritrea, which has one of the most repressive governments in the world. He was about to enter the university there when he was forced to join the army. He fled, leaving behind his wife. Yhdego says it has been very difficult, but going home is not an option. \"When I go, they kill me,\" he says. \"It is very hard.\" Yhdego learned enough German to get an internship. He impressed Georg Schikowski, the plant manager, who gave him a six-month contract. \"The goal is to [keep] him for a long, long time,\" says Schikowski, \"because he has shown us that he works good, and that's the test.\" Some Germans are skeptical about the usefulness of low-skill refugee workers. But Christof Ehrhart, a Deutsche Post/DHL vice president, says they're valuable, especially at companies like his that have lots of blue-collar jobs. And, he says, the refugees have demonstrated that they are motivated and engaged, \"because what they had to do in order to leave their country and come to a different place needed a lot of 'entrepreneurship' and willingness to run risks.\" Deutsche Post/DHL is a leading corporate employer of refugees, but so far it has fewer than 300 on the payroll. For integration to be successful, big German firms will have to do better, and Ehrhart says Germany can't afford to fail. \"I think the world is watching us,\" he says. \"I have to put it another way: I think there is no alternative than finding a solution. Because if we don't find a solution as one of the richest countries on the planet, who else should?\" Frustration and despair Back at the refugee barracks in Neuss, another Pakistani, Kamal Hussain, is waiting for his asylum decision. He fled Pakistan more than two years ago after the Taliban threatened to kill him for administering polio vaccine. He left behind a pregnant wife. She gave birth, but the son Hussain never saw died within months. Hussain is frustrated. He has little to occupy his time. He knows that's dangerous. \"If you're alone here and you have no activities right now, you will be negative,\" he says. \"You will be fighting with someone, or maybe you do something bad.\" Germans are worried about that, too \u2014 frustrated young men who might turn to crime or even terrorism. It has fueled a rise in support for the nationalist Alternative for Germany party, which is threatening Merkel's bid for re-election. There's no doubt that integrating refugees into German society is a high-stakes project.",

Susan Collins speaks to the media after voting against Betsy DeVos as education secretary on Capitol Hill on Feb. 7.\n                \n                    \n                    Mario Tama/Getty Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption Maine Sen. Susan Collins speaks to the media after voting against Betsy DeVos as education secretary on Capitol Hill on Feb. 7. Susan Collins has broken both of her ankles. She broke her left one when she was running in high heels to the Senate chamber because she so desperately refused to miss a vote. The Maine Republican has the second-longest voting streak in the Senate, by the way, after fellow Republican Chuck Grassley of Iowa. \"He has a longer streak, but I'm the only one who's never missed a single vote,\" said Collins in a recent interview in her office, referring to Grassley missing votes early in his Senate career. Not that she's keeping track. Collins, at 64, broke her right ankle just several weeks ago \u2014 when she slipped on black ice on her doorstep in Maine. And now, you'll find her gliding through the halls of Congress in a motorized scooter. At the scooter's maximum speed, a reporter would need to run to keep up with the senator. (This was confirmed when we took her scooter for a test-sprint outside her office this week.) And these wheels came just in time \u2013 because Collins is getting chased down by hordes of reporters lately. The success of President Trump's agenda will depend in large part on how unified Republicans are in a very narrowly divided Senate. And that's why all eyes are once again on Collins of Maine. On health care, on Cabinet nominees, on potentially changing Senate rules to push through a Supreme Court confirmation \u2013 as a Republican who hovers near the political center, Collins has once more found herself center stage. Gentle-mannered and almost always smiling \u2014 even when she's causing her party headaches \u2013 Collins is the Republican vote both sides watch. So in a chamber divided 52 to 48, with the most polarizing White House in modern history, her Republican colleagues say it matters more than ever now if Collins is a \"no\" vote. \"I think Senator Collins hits above her weight in terms of her influence on the body because she is willing to reach across the aisle,\" said Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina. \"She's not as ideological as a lot of members of the conference. And when you have 52 votes in the United States Senate, it doesn't take much to change the balance of power.\" That was evident when Collins was one of two Republicans who opposed Betsy DeVos to be education secretary, which led to the first tie-breaker vote in history by a vice president on a Senate confirmation. Collins is also leaning against drastically changing Senate rules \u2013 invoking the so-called \"nuclear option\" \u2013 to let Republicans confirm their Supreme Court nominee with 51 votes instead of the usual 60. On health care, she's wanted to slow down repeal of the Affordable Care Act, and she's co-sponsoring the only Republican bill that gives states the option of keeping Obamacare. \"Susan is used to being in this territory. This isn't the first time she has been willing to put aside party labels to do what she thinks is best for her state and for the country,\" said Democratic Sen. Claire McCaskill of Missouri. \"I think she's one of the few senators around here who understands the way you get to progress is through compromise.\" Democrats say Collins will be a key player if there's any hope of the Senate being a check against President Trump. \"We have hope that we can continue to appeal to her. We don't always win our case with her. She's independent-minded,\" said Democrat Dick Durbin of Illinois. \"But she has the courage to step up and do things that are unpopular. Many on the other side do not.\" Feeling the Pressure Last November, Collins wrote in a vote for House Speaker Paul Ryan for president. She now says she does want to see Trump succeed, but she's spoken out against him many times already since the election. She's criticized Trump's executive order on refugee resettlement and his decision to give Steve Bannon, the White House chief strategist, a permanent seat on the National Security Council principals committee. \"Our country is more divided than any time I have ever seen in the years that I've been in public life. And I'm very concerned about that,\" said Collins. \"I feel a special obligation, given the divisions in our country, to try to find a path forward on the many contentious issues that we're facing.\" Collins says being the deciding vote is nothing new \u2014 she's been a moderate throughout her 20 years in the Senate. But the spotlight is a lot more intense these days. \"I do feel more pressure,\" said Collins. \"This is not a completely unfamiliar role because I have been a deciding vote many times in the past \u2013 and it's never a comfortable position \u2013 but I can't tell you the number of people in Maine and elsewhere who have come up to me and have said to me, 'Are you going to be there for us? Are you going to protect us?'\" She's literally caught in the middle. In northern Maine, Trump won by 11 points. In southern Maine, Hillary Clinton won by 14 points. She acutely hears both sides of the fight right within her home state. Collins grew up in the small northern town of Caribou, where both her parents served as mayor and where her family has operated a lumber business since the 19th century. Her father went on to serve in both houses of the state legislature. \"I understand, coming from northern Maine, that Donald Trump's message really resonated with people who had lost their jobs due to poorly negotiated trade deals and are feeling disenfranchised, and are feeling that they've been left behind,\" said Collins. \"And in the more prosperous southern part of the state, which is more diverse ethnically, I understand the concerns that people have about refugees, for example, and minority populations that have come into our state.\" Maine has produced a long line of moderate politicians. But the other senator from Maine, independent Angus King, says being moderate now, in such a politically charged climate, can be much harder. \"Because people from both sides are so passionate. You know, 'if you're not 100 percent for me, you're against me.' People are being pulled to the edges. You rarely see huge rallies of moderates,\" said King, laughing. \"And moderate, by the way, doesn't mean you don't have views. It just means your views aren't predictable ideologically one way or the other, and you're trying to follow the facts where they lead and reach your own conclusions.\" And there's power in that. The saying \"all things in moderation\" takes on a special meaning in the Senate \u2013 where it takes only a handful of moderates to change any outcome.",

We provide for the economy.\"\n                \n                    \n                    Corin Cates-Carney for NPR\n                    \n                \nhide caption Wilmot Collins, the next mayor of Helena, Mont., came to the U.S. as a refugee during Liberia's civil war. Refugees are \"not bloodsuckers,\" he says. \"We are not just here to consume the resources. We provide for the economy.\" In a year of anti-refugee sentiment in many corners of the world (and especially in the U.S.), one former refugee and first-time candidate ran for office \u2014 and won. Twenty-three years before Wilmot Collins became the mayor-elect of Helena, Mont., he was a refugee from Liberia. He stood in a long line at the port of Monrovia, Liberia, waiting for a cargo vessel to carry him away from the country's civil war. Running on a progressive platform this November, Collins unseated a four-term incumbent in the capital city of Montana, a state where just over half a percent of the population is black. Collins, 54, will be sworn in on Jan. 2. \"I ran on funding, trying to fund the providers of essential services like our police and our firefighters because we realize that there have been many occasions where our firefighters had not been able to answer calls ... because they were short-staffed,\" Collins told NPR shortly after the election. \"So I went out and started campaigning on providing funding for essential services, and curbing our veterans and teenage homelessness. And it resonated with the voters.\" His campaign was not an attempt to make a statement amid national and worldwide debate about the treatment and tolerance of refugees. But that's often how his story is perceived. Now a child protection specialist for the Montana Department of Health and Human Services and a Navy reservist, Collins lives across the street from the school where he worked as a janitor upon arriving in Montana. When fleeing Liberia, he says he and his wife once had nothing to eat but toothpaste. We talked with Collins at his home this month, sitting with him at his dining room table. The interview has been edited for length and clarity. Were there preconceptions or prejudices that came up while you were running for office? I hear that a lot. But I knocked on a lot of doors. I participated in every event, every forum that was held. The people of Helena were only concerned with issues in Helena. I don't think they were looking at me saying, \"Whoa, this black guy in a predominantly white community.\" No, I think they were just looking at someone who wanted to serve. Was there anything about your upbringing in Liberia that led you to want to be a mayor or a leader in a community? I went to the University of Liberia. I completed my bachelor's in political science and sociology; I was very involved in the student government. At the time, the military had taken over the country, and we in the political science department were up in arms. And that's how I got my first taste of activism. That's how I got my first taste of political life. What can Liberia learn from American politics? I had an uphill battle because I was running against a very popular 16-year incumbent, a really decent person. But I was determined. And so, if I had to tell the Liberians anything, [it's that] they must first trust in their legal system. I would tell them to trust the legal system, and hard work and dedication will pay off. That's what happened here. What was the reaction from your friends and family here and in Liberia when you won? I've been getting congratulatory messages from everybody across the country \u2014 Texas, Florida, California, I mean you name it, Rhode Island. My friends were happy. We cheered. We divided cigars. In Liberia, every newspaper carried the story. I got more calls from Liberia than anywhere else. I got a call on behalf of the [Liberian] president. And then when I started getting the national media involvement, I was saying, \"Oh geez. How is this happening?\" I was only running a small Helena election campaign. I didn't think I was making history. I just wanted to be mayor. Why do you think your story got so much national attention? When I was running, I was not running as a refugee, but with what's been going on nationally with refugees I think it was good to know that all refugees are not what [critics] say they are. We're not bloodsuckers. We are not just here to consume the resources. We provide for the economy. I've met so many refugees all around the country \u2014 doctors, nurses, social workers, poets, authors, dentists. You name it, they're all over the place. So while I would not say we are all model citizens, we're no different from the ordinary people. And so I guess that's why this thing hit national. Have you experienced a change in your own identity as a Liberian man since moving to America and deciding to represent the people of Helena? When I came to Montana, there weren't a lot \u2014 there still aren't a lot \u2014 of African-Americans or black people. And kids are curious. People are curious. They hear my accent and want to know where I'm from. And it's not because they want to degrade you, demean you or anything. When I can see that they genuinely don't know, I use the moment as an educational one. And when you feel accepted, you want to give back. You are motivated to be a part of that community. And I felt accepted. Corin Cates-Carney covers politics and policy for Montana Public Radio. His works has appeared on NPR, The Atlantic, PBS and other outlets. Contact him @clccarney",

            "article_content": "Refugees are no longer allowed to settle in one western German city. Such bans are expected to be introduced in other cities as more Germans complain that there are too many refugees.  STEVE INSKEEP, HOST: Germany's welcome for asylum-seekers is wearing out. That became clear in Germany's recent elections. Mainstream political parties lost voters over that issue, and Chancellor Angela Merkel has struggled to form a government. One German state has imposed a refugee ban. The newcomers are not supposed to move to a particular city there. Other states and cities may try the same thing. Here's NPR's Soraya Sarhaddi Nelson. SORAYA SARHADDI NELSON, BYLINE: Like many industrial cities in Germany, Salzgitter has seen better days. The diesel emissions cheating scandal and international push for electric cars have hurt VW, which is Salzgitter's largest employer. That, in turn, is cutting into the sprawling city's coffers. The mayor of Salzgitter is Frank Klingebiel. FRANK KLINGEBIEL: (Speaking German). NELSON: He says the 5,800 refugees who've arrived in this city of 106,000 over the past two years are overwhelming government-provided services and schools. Klingebiel says the number may not sound like a lot, but it's a higher proportion than other cities have. Refugee advocates say part of what draws them to Salzgitter is affordable housing, which is in low supply in bigger German cities. The mayor says the temporary ban will help his government do a better job of integrating existing refugees and keep residents from resenting the newcomers. But the resentment here is already high. Resident Nina Drewes says she supports the ban because she feels refugees don't want to integrate into German society. NINA DREWES: (Speaking German). NELSON: The 42-year-old elder-care worker says an apartment-full live above her mother's home and that they are noisy late into the night. Drewes says, \"I don't feel comfortable being alone on the streets here anymore.\" DREWES: (Speaking German). NELSON: Even Syrian refugee Hassan Jandal, a day laborer who has been here for three years, says he supports the ban. HASSAN JANDAL: (Speaking German). NELSON: He says his local kindergarten is full and that all of the students are foreigners. Jandal adds, his rent is going up because the newcomers are increasing the demand for housing. Another supporter of the ban is Dincer Dinc, whose migrant help center has seen a fivefold increase in clients. He's a German of Kurdish descent who is Salzgitter's integration facilitator. Dinc says fellow residents who used to feel OK about refugees are now angry. DINCER DINC: (Speaking German). NELSON: He says, \"as a city, we need a break for more newcomers so we can help those already here. What good will it do to keep compounding our problems?\" Dinc and the mayor hope the ban will keep more voters in Salzgitter from embracing the xenophobic, nationalist platform of Alternative for Germany, or AfD. That right-wing party received nearly 14 percent of the vote in the city in last September's parliamentary elections, which is more than anywhere else in the state. But Sascha Schiessl (ph) of the Refugee Council for Lower Saxony (ph) says restricting refugees only strengthens the AfD by validating its claim that Muslim newcomers are harming German society. SASCHA SCHIESSL: The discussion is focused on refugees and the problems refugees create. But that's not the fact. That's not the case. The problems were there before the refugees. NELSON: Schiessl says money, rather than bans, will ease the burden on German cities. He lauded Lower Saxony for paying Salzgitter and other affected municipalities more than $23 million to help integrate refugees. But he says a lot more funding is needed.

            "article_content": "Voters in Alabama are choosing who will fill the Senate seat vacated by Jeff Sessions. GOP candidate Roy Moore is trying to rebound after allegations he sexually assaulted teenage girls decades ago.  STEVE INSKEEP, HOST: It's Election Day in Alabama. MARY LOUISE KELLY, HOST: It sure is. And it is worth remembering, this is just one of 100 Senate seats that is at stake. It is the seat vacated by Jeff Sessions, now the attorney general. But allegations of sexual misconduct amid a national debate about it have raised the profile of this race. Democrat Doug Jones says this election means a lot to Alabama. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) DOUG JONES: This election is going to be one of the most significant in our state's history in a long, long time. And we've got to make sure... (APPLAUSE) JONES: We've got to make sure that at this crossroads in Alabama's history, we take the right road. KELLY: So that's Doug Jones. Republican Roy Moore is accused by several women of pursuing them when they were teenagers. He was in his 30s. Roy Moore has broadly denied this. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) ROY MOORE: This election's for the people of Alabama. We dare defend our rights, and we will defend our rights in the United States Congress. (CHEERING) INSKEEP: Rachel Martin is joining us from our member station WBHM in Birmingham, Ala., with more on the race. Hey there, Rachel. How they're treating you down there? RACHEL MARTIN, HOST: Hi. Oh, it's the South. They're treating us great. You kidding me? (LAUGHTER) INSKEEP: Of course they are. Of course they are. MARTIN: Birmingham is a great town. INSKEEP: All right, I don't want to keep you from your breakfast, but let me just ask a couple questions, if I might. How are the two campaigns focusing at the end? MARTIN: Well, it is the push to the finish, right? We are in the final hours. Today's voting day. The Moore camp has been pretty consistent in this last push. For Roy Moore, this is the next step in a very long career in Alabama politics. His message is the same as it's always been, that he is an independent voice with a conservative, Christian worldview. And he says he's not going to hesitate to break glass in Washington, take on the establishment. Meanwhile, the Democratic challenger, Doug Jones - he's obviously got a steeper hill to climb. This is a bright-red state. So the state hasn't elected a Democrat to the Senate since 1992. Jones is hoping that he can turn out African-American voters. He's been pushing in that direction. The campaign's put a lot of energy there. Senator Cory Booker from New Jersey was here over the weekend - former Massachusetts Governor Deval Patrick. And of course, the most popular Democrat in this state is former President Barack Obama. He has not been here in person to stump with Doug Jones, but he has recorded robocalls in support of him. INSKEEP: Although, of course, none of those outsiders have a vote. What are the voters saying? MARTIN: Right, and indeed. So the diehard supporters in each camp - they've got their positions, and they'll tell you great things about both candidates. But on the whole, I would say based on the conversations we've had, there're a lot of conflicted voters here. One conservative Christian we spoke with said he's going to vote for Moore, but he's not happy about this at all. He described it as a similar feeling to the way he felt about voting for Donald Trump in 2016. He thinks that the candidate - Roy Moore, in this case - has a lot of personal failings, as he thought of President Trump - Donald Trump. In the end, though, Moore is the guy he sees as the person who reflects his values. He's going to cast votes in that direction. And foremost for him is the issue of abortion, which has really become a central issue in this debate. Doug Jones is a Democrat. He has a pro-choice policy platform, and even though he says he doesn't want to change the state's laws on abortion, that's not satisfying for Christian conservatives. On the other side, though, you've got Democrats voting for Doug Jones, and they're not that psyched. I talked to one cabdriver. He could not even conjure up the name when I asked who he was voting for. He just said, I'm not voting for Roy Moore, I'm going to vote for the other guy. INSKEEP: Oh, this is the problem when you're running against somebody who's getting such white-hot attention as Roy Moore has. The other guy becomes the issue. Let me just ask, though - you mentioned personal failings according to a Roy Moore voter - personal failings of Roy Moore. What are people feeling about the allegations against Moore, very briefly? MARTIN: I mean, his supporters say there's just no evidence. They say they're still allegations, and they haven't been proven. If they were, that would maybe be a different story. They question the timing. This guy's had a long political career. Why are they only coming out now? INSKEEP: OK. Rachel, thanks very much, appreciate it. MARTIN: You're welcome. INSKEEP: And we're going to hear much more from Rachel Martin over the next couple of days from WBHM in Birmingham, Ala. And of course, whoever wins the race in Alabama is going to end up reporting for work at the United States Senate. KELLY: Roy Moore has vowed that if he wins, he will back President Trump, despite some doubt about how reliable a vote he would be here in Washington. Senate Republicans do need his vote, but they are also wondering a lot of questions about the baggage he might bring. INSKEEP: NPR White House correspondent Scott Horsley joins us next. Scott, good morning. SCOTT HORSLEY, BYLINE: Good morning, Steve. INSKEEP: So President Trump has not only endorsed Roy Moore, but even recorded a robocall urging voters to back him. How much is at stake for the president? HORSLEY: Well, it depends on the time frame, Steve. In the short term, it's worth noting, whoever wins this race is not going to be seated until after the holidays. So in terms of the year-end push on the tax bill and spending bills, this doesn't matter. In the medium term, certainly, the president is looking forward to having another Republican vote on issues like welfare reform, entitlement spending. And then there's the longer term, which is what this election could mean for the GOP brand. If Moore is the victor, you can certainly look for Democrats to try to make him the poster child for the GOP in 2018, not only over these recent allegations of sexual misconduct, but also some of the many controversial things Roy Moore has said and done in the past and the controversial things he is likely to do and say in the future. INSKEEP: But what if Doug Jones wins and becomes that relative rarity, the red state Democrat in Congress? HORSLEY: Yeah, Donald Trump has said that Doug Jones would be a puppet of Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer. With the exception of abortion, there actually hasn't been a whole lot of talk about, you know, traditional Senate political issues during this contest. But it does look as if Doug Jones would be a pretty traditional Democrat on issues like Medicare, the Affordable Care Act, immigration. On trade, he is a free trader, which was a onetime Republican attitude, although it's not the Trump attitude. He might break from Schumer and Pelosi stylistically on some Second Amendment issues. We've seen that from other red-state Democrats. Another big question, though, as Mary Louise hints, is, you know, how reliable a vote would Roy Moore be for Republicans? Even though there has been this late push on his behalf, he owes very little allegiance to Mitch McConnell and the GOP. INSKEEP: How awkward is it for President Trump that there are these allegations against Roy Moore, and a number of women who've accused President Trump in similar ways - somewhat similar ways in the past - have chosen this moment to come forward again? HORSLEY: Yeah, the White House continues to sort of dismiss the charges against the president, although they're not as dismissive as he was during the campaign. Remember, back then, he threatened to sue his accusers. He did not. And in fact, one of them has sued him for defamation. But the White House continues to dispute the facts of what these women say. And more importantly, their argument is, look, voters knew about all these accusations last November, and they still elected Donald Trump president. So that, they say, should give him a sort of ballot-box absolution. INSKEEP: NPR's Scott Horsley - thank you very much. HORSLEY: You're welcome. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) INSKEEP: All right, we're still tracking the massive wildfires in Southern California. KELLY: Yeah. The biggest blaze - that would be the Thomas Fire - has charred more than 231,000 acres. It's now about 20 percent contained, but firefighters are struggling still to keep it away from coastal towns. INSKEEP: And KQED LA bureau chief Steven Cuevas joins us now from Southern California. Good morning. STEVEN CUEVAS, BYLINE: Good morning, Steve. INSKEEP: What's in danger now? CUEVAS: Well, this thing continues to burn in the west - to the west up in the foothills above Santa Barbara County coastal towns like Carpinteria, Montecito and Santa Barbara itself. So the concern continues to be that any significant shift in winds could send flames back towards these communities. And right now, it's mainly being driven not so much by the winds, but by very thick, dry brush that in some areas, you know, has not burned in a century or longer. INSKEEP: So we heard yesterday from our colleague Eric Westervelt about the scene in towns that have not yet been evacuated, and they're just watching the fires on the hillsides above town and waiting for the evacuation order. I gather you've been spending time with people who have had to evacuate. What's it like to go into one of these almost, like, refugee centers, and what do you hear? CUEVAS: Well, I visited one in - on the campus of Cal State, San Bernardino - excuse me, Cal State Santa Barbara. A lot of people who were there came from some of these communities like Carpinteria. It's a good distance away, too. We're talking about 20 miles. And I spent some time with a couple of elderly women, one of whom was 92. She was pretty remarkable. She was still pretty spry. She could get around on her own with the help of a little walker. They both left their homes in Carpinteria in the dark of night. It was about 3:30 in the morning when the flames really started coming into town. They're doing quite well. They're a bit shook-up, but I think they speak to the sort of hardy kind of nature of a lot of the people that live in these smaller coastal communities. This is not Malibu we're talking about. These are pretty, you know, scrappy little towns along the Pacific Ocean. INSKEEP: Although you're talking about people who have to walk away from everything they own and not know if they're going to see any of it again. CUEVAS: In some cases, for sure - the good thing in a town like Carpinteria is that so far, we've only seen a couple of structures lost, including one, perhaps two, homes. We don't have a full assessment of that yet. It's not like the damage we saw further to the west in the town of Ventura, which is also part of this, you know, monstrous fire complex. INSKEEP: And that damage is more severe in what way? CUEVAS: Far more homes got destroyed. We're talking hundreds - well over 600 in addition to many, many houses damaged. In addition, too, I might add, the one factor that's really bothering a lot of people is this thick, heavy smoke that's hanging (inaudible) the region. INSKEEP: OK. Steven Cuevas, thank you very much, really appreciate it. CUEVAS: Thanks, Steve. Good to talk to you. INSKEEP: He's with KQED.

Officials say their community and its resources are being overwhelmed by refugees, most of them from Syria.\n                \n                    \n                    Soraya Sarhaddi Nelson/NPR\n                    \n                \nhide caption Residents of Salzigitter shop at the local mall. Officials say their community and its resources are being overwhelmed by refugees, most of them from Syria. Like many industrial cities in Germany, Salzgitter, in the northern state of Lower Saxony, has seen better days. The sprawling municipality's largest employer, Volkswagen, has been hurt by the diesel emissions cheating scandal and international pressure to cut emissions with electric cars \u2014 which in turn has cut into Salzgitter's income from taxes and jobs. City officials say thousands of Syrian refugees who have moved to Salzgitter are making things worse, overwhelming government-provided services and schools. So last month, the Lower Saxony state government voted to ban refugees from moving to Salzgitter. It was the first German city to impose such a prohibition. Officials then announced they will do the same in two other Lower Saxony cities, Delmenhorst and Wilhelmshaven. The bans are part of a trend by authorities from the federal level on down to restrict refugees' movements in a country where more than 1 million asylum seekers have arrived over the past three years. The German national message of \"Refugees Welcome\" has been overshadowed by growing complaints about newcomers draining resources and benefits. Refugees are accused by Germans of not integrating quickly into their society, even if German officials are in large part to blame by failing to provide enough help to make integration happen. A key reason why Chancellor Angela Merkel's bid to form a new German government fell apart earlier this month centered on disagreement over refugees. Most mainstream parties want to limit more from entering Germany. But bans like the one in Salzgitter have led to criticism both in Germany and abroad. In an email to NPR, the U.N. refugee agency said the ban violates international law, which guarantees refugees freedom of movement. (The agency noted Salzgitter is granting exceptions, such as in cases of family reunification). Salzgitter Mayor Frank Klingebiel says city services and schools are stretched to the limits by thousands of refugees who migrated there. He welcomes the state ban on additional refugees coming into his city and notes that it is temporary.\n                \n                    \n                    Esme Nicholson/NPR\n                    \n                \nhide caption Salzgitter Mayor Frank Klingebiel says city services and schools are stretched to the limits by thousands of refugees who migrated there. He welcomes the state ban on additional refugees coming into his city and notes that it is temporary. Salzgitter Mayor Frank Klingebiel says there is no choice but to stop more refugees from moving to the city, adding that the ban won't last more than three years. \"We have 106,000 residents [and] about 5,800 refugees. By comparison, Hanover has 500,000 residents and about 3,500 refugees,\" he says, referring to Lower Saxony's capital. He adds that 91 percent of refugees in Salzgitter don't have a job and are on welfare. \"Our goal is to make integration successful,\" he says. \"And to keep the peace.\" Klingebiel says there will be less local resentment toward newcomers if officials are given time and money to build more schools and daycare facilities and hire additional staff so residents won't feel crowded out. That's not the case now, says Dincer Dinc, a German of Kurdish descent who is a Salzgitter native and serves as the city's integration facilitator. He says kindergartens and schools in five of the city's 31 districts are maxing out and that welfare offices and job centers are filled to capacity. Even his migrant help center, staffed by volunteers, has experienced a five-fold increase in cases, Dinc says. \"The city's image is changing for residents,\" he says. \"They encounter more and more people with darker skin and wearing headscarves.\" At a local mall, most of the residents NPR interviewed favor the ban. Nina Drewes, 42, an eldercare worker, says she agrees with the prohibition not because she hates foreigners, but because she believes they refuse to integrate into German society. \"A whole bunch of them live over my mother's apartment and they are noisy past acceptable hours,\" she says. \"And as a woman, I don't feel comfortable being alone on the streets here anymore.\" Integration facilitator Dincer Dinc, a Salzgitter native of Kurdish descent, says he thinks the temporary ban on more refugees coming to his city is a good idea to try and defuse rising anti-refugee sentiment.\n                \n                    \n                    Esme Nicholson/NPR\n                    \n                \nhide caption Integration facilitator Dincer Dinc, a Salzgitter native of Kurdish descent, says he thinks the temporary ban on more refugees coming to his city is a good idea to try and defuse rising anti-refugee sentiment. Even Syrian refugee Hassan Jandal, 34, who is a day laborer and has lived here for three years, says he supports the ban. \"It's full here, the kindergarten, all of them foreigners,\" he says. \"That's not good.\" He says his rent is also going up, because the newcomers are increasing the demand for housing. Dinc says he personally embraces the growing diversity in Salzgitter, a city that was the site of one of the largest industrial conglomerates during the Third Reich. \"But I can't prevent people who were once neutral from wondering if this is the Salzgitter they used to know,\" Dinc adds. \"As a city, we need a break from more newcomers, because we need to help those who are already here. What good will it do for more and more [refugees] to be drawn here so that the problems we have keep compounding?\" He says other parts of Germany \u2013 especially in the east \u2014 need to take in a greater share of refugees than they do currently so that it's more proportional. Dinc and the mayor also believe the ban will also keep more Salzgitter voters from embracing the xenophobic, nationalist platform of the Alternative for Germany (AfD) party. The right-wing populists received nearly 14 percent of the vote here in the Sept. 24 federal elections \u2013 a percentage that is higher than anywhere else in Lower Saxony. But many other Germans, including Sascha Schiessl of the Refugee Council for Lower Saxony, argue placing restrictions on refugees only strengthens AfD by validating its claims that the refugees, who are mostly Muslim, are harming German society. He says money, rather than bans, can ease the burden on German cities. He lauded Lower Saxony for sending Salzgitter, Delmenhorst and Wilhelmshaven a total of $23.5 million for this year and next, to help with the integration of refugees. \"The discussion is focused on refugees and the problems refugees create, but that's not the fact, that's not the case,\" Schiessl says. \"The problems were there before the refugees.\" NPR Berlin bureau producer Esme Nicholson contributed to this story.",

A few days after Donald Trump was elected President, more than a hundred people packed into a church sanctuary in Poughkeepsie, N.Y. to hear a presentation about refugee resettlement in their town. It didn't go well. This was after Trump had campaigned on refusing Syrian refugees, citing security concerns. In the church that night, staffers from the non-profit organization Church World Service laid out their plan to open a refugee resettlement office in Poughkeepsie, and bring in about 80 refugees, mostly from the Congo, Iraq and Syria. The audience had questions. A lot of them. They wanted to know, would they be safe? And could Poughkeepsie afford to care for these new residents? What I didn't anticipate was how the issue would be politicized by the election climate. It went from being a kind of run of the mill, like, 'maybe not here,' to 'these Muslims are going to take over our neighborhood and ruin Poughkeepsie.' Patrick DeYoung \"As a resident of this town, of this city, I can look out my window any time and find someone in need,\" said Poughkeepsie resident Steven Planck, to vigorous applause. The head of Church World Service's refugee program, Erol Kekic, spent more than an hour trying to respond to the questions. \"We had to do a lot of truth-telling, and dispel some myths,\" says Kekic. \"From 'the value of my property will go down because refugees will be resettling next to me,' to 'are we bringing terrorists?' to 'why are we bringing people who don't all look like us?'\" Erol Kekic is the executive director of the Immigration and Refugee Program at the global humanitarian agency Church World Service.\n                \n                    \n                    Joel Rose/NPR\n                    \n                \nhide caption Erol Kekic is the executive director of the Immigration and Refugee Program at the global humanitarian agency Church World Service. It's getting harder for refugees to find a welcoming home in the U.S. The Trump administration has cut the number of refugees allowed into the country. In cities and town across the nation, citizens are protesting refugees being resettled in their neighborhoods. In Poughkeepsie, the debate got ugly. On social media, people called opponents of the refugee plan racists and Islamophobes. The staff of Church World Service received death threats. \"What I didn't anticipate was how the issue would be politicized by the election climate,\" says Vassar College student Patrick DeYoung, who helped launch the effort to bring refugees to Poughkeepsie. He says the intensity of the debate surprised him. \"It went from being a kind of run of the mill, like, maybe not here, to, these Muslims are going to take over our neighborhood and ruin Poughkeepsie,\" DeYoung says. Until recently, refugee resettlement in the U.S. had wide bipartisan support. The U.S. State Department, along with nine large non-profit groups, decides where to resettle refugees fleeing persecution, war and violence. They look for communities where there are volunteers to help. Patrick DeYoung is one of those volunteers. He's now a college senior, but before he came to Vassar, Sgt. DeYoung served five years in the Army. He did two tours in Afghanistan, where he saw firsthand civilians being forced from their homes. \"I felt that there was an obligation to, you know, welcome the stranger and to to help people, a chance for the country to show its best self,\" DeYoung says. \"So, why not here? Why not in Poughkeepsie?\" Others in town felt that was the wrong question to ask. \"We all wondered, why? Why Poughkeepsie?\" says David Cole, 37, a lifelong resident of the town who helped mobilize opposition to Church World Service. Cole insists he has nothing against Muslims or other refugees. But he says Poughkeepsie isn't a wealthy town; unemployment there is higher than the statewide average. \"I looked at people that I knew,\" Cole says. \"And I said, OK, well, why aren't these people getting help? Why are we trying to help, you know, people from war-torn countries in an area where there's people looking for jobs? Like, they're scavenging for jobs around here. I don't get it.\" Lifelong Poughkeepsie resident David Cole,37, helped mobilize opposition to the refugee resettlement plan.\n                \n                    \n                    Joel Rose/NPR\n                    \n                \nhide caption Lifelong Poughkeepsie resident David Cole,37, helped mobilize opposition to the refugee resettlement plan. Church World Service did open an office in Poughkeepsie. But it only resettled one family of five. The same story is playing out across America. Critics of the refugee program say they're mobilizing in at least a dozen places where people want more control over who's coming to live in their communities. State and local officials are supposed to be consulted before refugees come to their areas, says Susan Tully, national field director at the Federation for American Immigration Reform, which advocates for lower levels of immigration. But in practice, Tully says, that's not happening enough. \"The volunteer organizations who resettle these people seem to be almost the single driving force, and deciding voice, of where they go,\" Tully says. \"People are saying, oh, wait a minute, you're not the only one that's got a dog in this fight.\" Now, the state of Tennessee is suing the federal government to block refugee resettlement there. The mayor of Rutland, Vt. was voted out of office earlier this year after trying to bring in refugees to give the town's small workforce a boost. And in St. Cloud, Minnesota, some residents are calling for a moratorium on resettlement as the refugee community grows into the thousands. (In response, the City Council passed a resolution \"in support of a just and welcoming city\".) Still, Erol Kekic at Church World Service says most people support refugees, even in those places. \"Yes, there are loud voices in every community,\" Kekic says. \"But they're usually not the majority, and they're usually just a very loud minority.\" Kekic himself was a refugee from Bosnia more than 20 years ago. He says refugees do use public benefits, such as welfare and health care. But over time, refugees also start business and become productive members of society. \"At the end of the day, all of these differences \u2014 they may look different, speak a different language \u2014 kind of blend in. And you just get a new neighbor,\" Kekic says. But that's not what happened in Poughkeepsie. More than a year after that contentious meeting in the church sanctuary, the town's residents are still bitterly divided. Church World Service has closed its local office. The resettlement agency says there aren't enough new refugees arriving in the U.S. to justify an office there since President Trump slashed the number that are allowed in. And that one refugee family that came to Poughkeepsie? They're gone too. They moved away to find a community with other Congolese immigrants. A more welcoming community.",

            "article_content": "Three Alabama newspapers urged voters not to elect GOP Senate candidate Roy Moore, who's accused of sexual misconduct. In Kenya, judges dismissed a pair of petitions challenging the Oct. 26 vote.  STEVE INSKEEP, HOST: More Republicans are opposing Alabama Senate candidate Roy Moore - opposing him, but they're still not entirely sure if they can vote for a Democrat. RACHEL MARTIN, HOST: Right. So the state's biggest newspapers have now turned against Moore. All three of them ran editorials over the weekend discouraging Alabama Republicans from voting for the GOP Senate candidate. We should note the papers are all owned by the same company. This is the Alabama Media Group. The editorials called on voters to stand for decency and to reject Moore, who's been accused of sexual misconduct by several women. He has denied this time and again. But Republican Senator Susan Collins told CNN she isn't buying it and she hopes the voters of Alabama do not elect him. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) SUSAN COLLINS: I read his explanation. I listened to his radio interview. And I did not find his denials to be convincing at all. So from my perspective, these are credible allegations against him. MARTIN: As for President Trump, the White House budget director, Mick Mulvaney, told NBC that the president doesn't know who to believe. (SOUNDBITE OF TV SHOW, \"MEET THE PRESS\") MICK MULVANEY: He thinks that the voters of Alabama should decide. I think that's probably the most commonsense way to look at it. INSKEEP: OK. Let's talk about this with NPR congressional correspondent Susan Davis, who's in our studios once again. Good morning, Sue. SUSAN DAVIS, BYLINE: Good morning, Steve. INSKEEP: OK. That Republicans would be uncomfortable with Roy Moore is not news. But what are these papers saying that Alabama voters who are Republicans should do? DAVIS: They're essentially taking an anybody-but-Roy-Moore position. I think they recognize that most of their voters are very conservative and have said, if you cannot stomach voting for a Democrat - which is Doug Jones - write in another candidate, although I would note that a write-in in this instance is essentially a vote for Doug Jones who is the Democrat in that race. INSKEEP: Oh, because it takes a vote away from Roy Moore. DAVIS: Exactly. And there is no other option. This is still a binary choice of an election INSKEEP: Still a binary choice - but with that binary choice, aren't Alabama state Republicans sticking behind him? There was a steering committee of some kind last week that put out a statement saying we're still with Roy Moore. We can't abide electing a Democrat who might vote on Supreme Court justices and so forth. DAVIS: This is a good example of the disconnect between sort of Washington Republicans and state Republicans. The Alabama Republican Party has not abandoned him. The governor of Alabama, Kay Ivey, has said she will vote for him. The congressional delegation in the House has stood by him, although the senior senator Richard Shelby has not. And I would note you can also argue that these newspaper endorsements going against Roy Moore might help his cause among these same conservatives... INSKEEP: More of the establishment is... DAVIS: ...Who look at the media the same way they look at the establishment in Washington. INSKEEP: OK. So that's Roy Moore. And then there's Al Franken, the Minnesota senator who faced his own accusation and acknowledged wrongdoing last week. What kind of response has there been in his home state of Minnesota? DAVIS: Well, he's actually staying in Washington for the Thanksgiving break. His spokeswoman told that to the Minnesota Star Tribune. They said his family - he's going to spend the holiday doing some reflecting with his family but said he will not resign from the Senate. The next question of course is, will the Senate Ethics Committee investigate Senator Franken, as he has called on them to do? INSKEEP: And if there's an investigation - I mean, there's some people who are asking - is that a real investigation? What's to investigate? Is that just putting this off to allow some time to think about it? What's going on there, really? DAVIS: It's a good question, and it raises a really difficult question, which is - can you sort of prosecute - or not prosecute but investigate and punish someone for something they did before they were in elected office? INSKEEP: Sue, thanks very much. DAVIS: You're welcome. INSKEEP: That's NPR's Susan Davis this morning. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) INSKEEP: OK. Now let's turn to Kenya, where there is a supreme court decision that affects who gets to lead the country. MARTIN: Yeah, the Kenyan Supreme Court threw out challenges to the recent repeat election of President Uhuru Kenyatta. Opposition to Kenyatta's election had been widespread and deadly, killing dozens of people. This is since the initial vote was held back in August. (SOUNDBITE OF DISTORTED AMBIENT NOISE) MARTIN: More than 30 people were killed just this past weekend alone. INSKEEP: And that sound that we're hearing is the sound of the phone line from East Africa on which NPR's Eyder Peralta is going to talk with us. Eyder, where are you? EYDER PERALTA, BYLINE: So I am in front of the supreme court right now. And there's a big celebration going on, people who are supporters Uhuru Kenyatta. And they're singing, and they're using drums. And they're extremely happy that their president has gotten this opportunity to reclaim what they say is a second victory. INSKEEP: OK. So there are people in favor of the president there. I guess if you went elsewhere in the country, you would find people against. What was the case against Uhuru Kenyatta allowing him to take the oath again? PERALTA: So the court didn't tell us. The court basically said they dismissed two petitions against the elections, and they did not give a reason why. But as you mentioned, other parts of Kenya are burning. I mean, just, you know, a few miles from here, you have basically most of the slums here in Nairobi, where people are burning cars and, you know, they have looted some shops. And there's been a lot of death this past weekend. At least 31 people have been killed. So there's a lot of this country that is very unhappy. INSKEEP: Just because we're continuing to hear the celebration - the whistles blowing, the drums beating - behind you there, Eyder, I'd like to ask - is that the support for the president genuine? Is there a large faction of the country that is with him as well as a large faction against him? PERALTA: This is an evenly split country, if you believe the results of the first elections. The opposition will tell you otherwise. But, you know, about half of the people support the president. About half of the people support the opposition. And that's why getting out of this will be so tough for this country. Finding reconciliation somehow will be very tough. And another thing that makes it tough is that the opposition leader has said that no matter what the court decided today, he would not accept the results and that he does not accept Uhuru Kenyatta as the legitimate president of Kenya. INSKEEP: Americans who remember the disputed election of 2000 will recall how bitter and how difficult it can be to resolve this, even when a court does step in. So what is supposed to happen now, Eyder? Is the supreme court done? Do they look more deeply into these two different elections, both of which were disputed in different ways? (SOUNDBITE OF DRUMMING) UNIDENTIFIED MAN: (Chanting unintelligibly). PERALTA: This is the end. This is the end of the road. There are no more legal options for the opposition. But, you know, the opposition says they will take this to the streets. And that is problematic in a country that has seen a lot of political violence in the past. INSKEEP: Eyder, give us one more vision of what you're seeing there. (SOUNDBITE OF WHISTLE SOUNDING) PERALTA: Right now I'm seeing a lot of people waving Kenyan flags, and they're using drums. And they're celebrating. You know, this has been a long three months here, and they think that it has finally come to an end. These are supporters of the president. INSKEEP: OK. Some people celebrating, others definitely not - NPR's Eyder Peralta's is there to cover it all. Thanks, Eyder. PERALTA: Thank you, Steve. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) INSKEEP: More news from a troubled democracy - although certainly not as troubled. Angela Merkel's historic tenure as Germany's leader is in jeopardy and so is the stability that that country has seen during her 12 years in power. MARTIN: Right, Steve. So Angela Merkel got a whole lot of political blowback because she opened Germany's borders at the height of the refugee crisis in Europe. That's important because she won despite that in... INSKEEP: Yeah. MARTIN: ...The election that happened past November. INSKEEP: You were there to watch that. MARTIN: Right. So that election wasn't as clear-cut, though, as Merkel and her party wanted it to be. They ended up losing support. And it forced them to try to form a coalition government with other parties, where it is today. Her effort to do that has failed. (SOUNDBITE OF PRESS CONFERENCE) CHANCELLOR ANGELA MERKEL: (Speaking German). MARTIN: That's Merkel talking this morning, telling reporters she is going to continue to lead Germany to the best of her abilities. The big question - how much longer, though, is she going to be able to lead at all? INSKEEP: Let's ask NPR's Soraya Sarhaddi Nelson, who's based in Germany - who's covered this story for years. Hi, Soraya. SORAYA SARHADDI NELSON, BYLINE: Good morning, Steve. INSKEEP: Rachel mentioned refugees. Is that really something that is dragging the chancellor down? NELSON: Absolutely. I mean, this really caused her party to lose so much support during this past election. And it weakened her considerably during these coalition talks that went on for four weeks. They were just exploratory talks - mind you - to see whether these four divergent parties she needed in order to have a government basically - you know, whether they could even get together. And then this all fell apart, unfortunately, last night. INSKEEP: We say, of course, unfortunately from Merkel's perspective. Perhaps there are others who are happier about this development. So if you're the chancellor of Germany, if you can't assemble a majority coalition, what are your options? NELSON: Well, the options - I mean, first thing she has to do at this point is go talk to the German president and see what he advises and also - first of all, to see whether she can perhaps lead with a minority government, which means she would not have a majority of the MPs backing her in Parliament. But she also needs to be elected chancellor. I mean, it's her party. The way it works here - it's a parliamentary system. And so the parties get elected, and then after that, it's the Parliament that decides who is the chancellor. INSKEEP: Is it possible that they would just do a rerun - call another election? NELSON: Yeah, that's a definite possibility now. And it's problematic at best because there are a lot of procedural things that have to happen for that to go forward. Plus, on top of that, there is a fear here that the right-wing populists, who are now the third-largest party in terms of vote-getters who are in Parliament - that they're going to gain more seats out of it - that people will be so frustrated with the fact that the mainstream parties couldn't pull it together that they might cast more votes for the right-wing populists. INSKEEP: OK, Soraya, thanks for the update. Really appreciate it. NELSON: You're welcome, Steve. INSKEEP: That's NPR international correspondent Soraya Sarhaddi Nelson reporting on news from Germany, where Chancellor Angela Merkel has been unable to form a coalition government.

            "article_content": "German Chancellor Angela Merkel arrives at her Berlin party headquarters Friday for talks with members of potential coalition parties to form a new government.\n                \n                    \n                    Kay Nietfeld/AFP/Getty Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption German Chancellor Angela Merkel arrives at her Berlin party headquarters Friday for talks with members of potential coalition parties to form a new government. For seven years, Angela Merkel has topped Forbes magazine's list of the most powerful women in the world. In the wake of populism's rise in European and U.S. politics, she's seen by many as a vital pillar of Western values and multilateralism. But the 63-year-old chancellor of Germany could soon lose her job if she fails to form a new government. That prospect is growing, even as the four political parties she needs for a governing coalition agreed early Friday to try one last time to overcome their seemingly insurmountable differences in the coming days. \"I think it's 'Jamaica' or it's over,\" warned commentator Nico Fried of the daily Sueddeutsche Zeitung, referring to the nickname Germans have given the would-be coalition, whose parties' black, yellow and green colors match those of the Caribbean nation's flag. \"This could be the end of Angela Merkel.\" Among the key sticking points is how Germany plans to mitigate climate change, like whether to cut back on coal use, which accounts for 40 percent of German electrical power. Or whether to allow certain categories of refugees who've been granted asylum in Germany to send for their relatives, which officials estimate would amount to 150,000 to 180,000 people. Proponents say refugees can't integrate into German society if they are forced to leave their families behind, while opponents argue Germany is already overwhelmed by asylum seekers. That the would-be political allies are refusing to budge on their positions is no surprise, given some are longtime rivals who have never jointly governed the country before. The four parties are Merkel's conservative Christian Democratic Union and its Bavarian sibling, the Christian Social Union, the left-leaning, environmentalist Greens and the business-friendly Free Democrats (FDP). FDP Vice-chair Wolfgang Kubicki, a veteran negotiator, told German public broadcaster ARD his party and the others remain so far apart after a month of talks that he \"can't imagine how we can come together\" on a compromise over the next few days. The chancellor, who excels at forging consensus both domestically and internationally in times of crisis, hasn't managed to break the logjam. Some German analysts say it's a sign of how weak she's become politically because of her refugee policy, which involved opening Germany's doors to a million newcomers and led to some of the poorest-ever results for the parties of her last governing coalition in September's parliamentary elections. Even so, Merkel sounded optimistic as she emerged from the negotiations in Berlin before dawn on Friday. She greeted journalists with a cheerful \"Good morning\" and informed them that negotiations would continue. One reason for her optimism is that she has struggled \u2014 and succeeded \u2014 before in forming governing coalitions, including her first one in 2005, after her party defeated then-Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder's Social Democrats by a narrow margin. And working in her favor is the one crucial point Merkel's would-be coalition partners agree on: They all want to sideline the Alternative for Germany (AfD). The right-wing, populist party, which is serving in the German Parliament for the first time, is currently the third-strongest faction. According to recent polls, it would likely gain more seats if new elections are called. All other parties elected to the German Parliament denounce the AfD and vow to block its agenda, which they say is nationalistic and xenophobic. Merkel's calm and reflective leadership style is also ideal for governing a diverse coalition, says Ursula Muench, who runs the Academy for Political Education near Munich. \"You can accuse Chancellor Merkel of a lot of things, but she is a great tactician,\" Muench says. \"She's succeeded time and again in getting her European partners to reach a consensus.\" But what will happen if she fails to form a new coalition government? Merkel's chief of staff Peter Altmaier told ARD TV that he's confident a Jamaica coalition will happen. \"We have a responsibility to our country and I'm convinced most of the people negotiating with me see it the same way,\" he said. Even if he's right, many analysts predict Merkel will have a hard time accomplishing much during her next term \u2013 which could well be her last. \"It's going to be harder for her\" than before, says Uwe Jun, a political scientist at the University of Trier. \"Her job \u2013 and we see that now with the exploratory talks \u2013 is primarily to hold the whole thing together and to moderate\" them. As a result, he says, Merkel might choose to spend more time on European and other international affairs and leave the domestic agenda to her divergent coalition partners.",

Tilahun Liben thought he was seeing things. Surely that mound of orange orbs under those trees near his church couldn't be oranges. Could they? It was 2010, and Liben had just arrived in Tucson, Ariz., as a refugee from Ethiopia. He had been a musician, playing saxophone in nightclubs, but that life ended abruptly in 1999 when an oppressive regime imprisoned him for three months for his political dissent. After Liben's release, further persecution forced him to flee his homeland: He ended up at the Kakuma refugee camp, in Kenya, where he waited 10 years to be resettled. Liben, 46, hadn't been in the city more than a few months when he met Barbara Eiswerth, an American who had, by chance, visited Kakuma during Liben's stay. Here in Tucson, Liben learned, Eiswerth had founded an organization called Iskashitaa Refugee Network that helps refugees find community and purpose through gleaning backyard fruit, which they eat themselves and share with other Arizonans in need. Gleaning \u2014 or harvesting unwanted fruit \u2014 was a new concept to Liben. Then again, so was the sight of oranges and grapefruit piling up beneath trees. \"In Ethiopia, the owner of the tree will get the fruit to the market,\" Liben says. \"And when there was fruit on the ground, people would pick it up and use it. There's no waste.\" Within days, Liben was knocking on Iskashitaa's door. Eiswerth started Iskashitaa in 2003, after she mapped Tucson's public fruit as part of her doctoral program in geology \u2014 a project that revealed to her the area's edible inventory. Not wanting that bounty to go to waste, she and her colleagues had distributed it at several \"free farmer's markets.\" One of these events specifically targeted refugee children, whose enthusiasm for the gleaned fruit blew Eiswerth away. \"I thought, wow, the need is here in this refugee community,\"she says. \"Why not teach them about local food resources while teaching them to fit in?\" The produce makes a difference to Tucson's refugees, who despite having an organizational sponsor, often live in poverty. In nearly two decades of working with refugees, Eiswerth, 55, has seen the depth of their talents and skills, but also their hardships. \"I've gone into refugee homes and opened a fridge to see a gallon of milk, a few bottles of water and a few fruits,\" she says. Barbara Eiswerth, founder and director of Iskashitaa, sorts fresh dates gathered by refugees and volunteers in neighborhoods around Tucson, Ariz.\n                \n                    \n                    Bill Hatcher\n                    \n                \nhide caption While Iskashitaa doesn't pay refugees to glean, Eiswerth does whatever she can to help them out \u2014 offering gift cards, clothing vouchers, donated toiletries, referrals to grief and trauma programs, and, of course, hundreds of pounds of fruit. Iskashitaa \u2014 which means \"working cooperatively together\" in Somali Bantu, the ethnicity of many early volunteers \u2014 provides more than just healthy food. It also serves as a refuge and an opportunity for those whose lives have been radically disrupted. \"We provide healing through harvesting,\" Eiswerth likes to say. \"We help refugees belong to something, and we give them a chance to give back to a country that gave them a second lease on life.\" For some, that sense of community is as important as Iskashitaa's mission. Faeza Hililian, an Iraqi refugee of Armenian descent, volunteers at Iskashitaa partly because she has the time \u2014 she's a retired dentist \u2014 and partly to keep her mind occupied. \"I don't like to stay home and think about the past and get sad. Nobody can imagine how in one minute you can lose everything,\" says Hililian, 70, whose family spent more than three years in Syria before being accepted into the United States. Iskashitaa's refugees find the idea of harnessing American excess to feed those in need compelling. The organization rescues 50 tons of produce annually, but that's only about 10 percent of what's locally available. (Nationally, about a third of fruit and vegetables are lost or wasted along the food chain.) Iskashitaa participants, including refugees and volunteers, weigh edible plants they have gathered on a farm.\n                \n                    \n                    Bill Hatcher\n                    \n                \nhide caption \"The waste makes me so sad because a lot of people around the world don't have anything to eat,\" Hililian says. \"I am happy to work to save every food [item], because I think, 'We could use that!' You can make many things out of the fruit and vegetables \u2014 juice, pickles, jam. Don't give it to the garbage!\" And so Iskashitaa extends the shelf life of citrus by making jam and converting dates into honey in the commercial kitchen of a local church. It also holds free classes on gardening, cooking, juicing, dehydrating, fermenting, pickling, canning and making fruit syrups, which it sells at farmer's markets. Refugees also coax meals from often-ignored foods. Floyd Gray, a longtime volunteer and fruit donor, said he's learned plenty from having refugees harvest his garden excess. When Iskashitaa sent a few Iraqis to pick grapes from his home arbor, Gray was thrilled to learn that the leaves were also sought to make rice-stuffed dolmades. And he was surprised when a few West Africans harvested his squash leaves. \"They just boiled 'em up and ate them! It's pretty interesting to see other people's cooking styles and what they do with things we never thought were edible,\" says Gray. \"Now, I eat the leaves from cauliflower \u2014 I cook it up with collard greens and mustard greens.\" But the prime \"use-it-all\" example is the Seville orange, widely planted in Arizona as a decorative tree but ignored as the sour or \"poison orange.\" That characterization appalls Iskashitaa volunteers from Iraq, where those oranges are a key culinary component, akin to lemons. \"The sour orange is like medicine,\" says Hililian. \"You can make jam with it, you can do all kinds of things.\" Over the years, Iskashitaa, which has an annual operating budget of $100,000, has steadily matured, incorporating the expertise of new participants, both refugees and University of Arizona students from a wide range of programs who flock to intern and volunteer. The bounty at Iskashitaa include jujubes, left, and limes, right.\n                \n                    \n                    Bill Hatcher \n                    \n                \nhide caption The bounty at Iskashitaa include jujubes, left, and limes, right. But the organization's growth hasn't been without friction. Scale has become an issue. Eiswerth recently filled a local pool with citrus to show that the organization was, literally and figuratively, swimming in grapefruit. (A single citrus tree can yield 1,500 pounds of fruit.) Lacking refrigeration, the group stores produce in the shade of its adobe headquarters, where black and green milk crates brim with orange and yellow citrus, and blue tarps house the overflow. \"If someone would like to donate a truck-in or walk-in cooler,\" Eiswerth says, \"that would be great. It's 102 [degrees] outside now.\" President Trump's current refugee ban and anti-immigrant rhetoric also pose challenges for an organization working with refugees from five of the original seven blacklisted nations. Eiswerth says that refugees are equally scared and discouraged by developments. But the political turmoil also provides a teachable moment. Since the election, Eiswerth says, \"we have an opportunity to educate and engage more people. Churches who never mentored a refugee family before are now doing it. I think it's profoundly impactful for American-born families to meet a refugee for the first time and experience their life for a minute.\" The fruit, nuts and other foods that Iskashitaa participants gather are sometimes dried and processed into jams, syrups and vinegar to raise money for the organization.\n                \n                    \n                    Bill Hatcher\n                    \n                \nhide caption Liben, the Ethiopian musician, feels that his American experience demonstrates that refugees bring more than they take. Despite working full time at a nursing home, he still volunteers at Iskashitaa, occasionally plays saxophone at group events, and serves as a board member. \"All the refugees I know who have come here, they all learned how to work hard. They are living peacefully with no trauma in a free country. They say 'God Bless America,' because America provides a lot for us.\" Liben pauses for a moment, and smiles. \"But also, we are the ones who bless America with our hard work.\" This story was produced in collaboration with the Food & Environment Reporting Network, a nonprofit, investigative news organization.

            "article_content": "Austrians vote today in an election likely to shake up the traditional two-party structure of politics in Austria \u2014 and see an anti-immigrant far-right party form part of the next government.  MICHEL MARTIN, HOST: We're going to start the program with today's elections in Austria. Early results in the parliamentary race suggest a right-leaning government will be formed due in large part to voters worried about Muslim refugees in Europe. That would put Austrian Foreign Minister Sebastian Kurz on track to be Europe's youngest head of government. But his party did not get a majority, meaning he will have to partner with another faction, which many in Austria predict could be a right-wing party linked to former Nazis. We go to NPR's Soraya Sarhaddi Nelson, who's in Vienna covering the election. Soraya, thanks for joining us. SORAYA SARHADDI NELSON, BYLINE: My pleasure. MARTIN: So tell us more about the foreign minister and his party. NELSON: Well, as you mentioned, he's young. He's 31 years old, and he has rock-star status, you know, with his youthful looks, slicked-back hair. He's an avid outdoorsman. He's also the longest-serving minister in the current government, if you can believe it. He was 24 when he became foreign minister. And his Austrian People's Party has been in the government even longer - 30 years. And yet, somehow, he's been able to persuade voters here that he and his party are really agents for change. He took over that party, which is called the Austrian People's Party, in May. And he even gave it a new color. It normally is associated with the color black, but he gave it a turquoise color. And he managed to convince Austrians that they really needed a change in this government - that, again, his party had actually been in for 30 years - and that life for Austrians was becoming more difficult, even though the economy is doing pretty well here at the moment with more jobs and low unemployment. MARTIN: Why would Kurz want to partner with the right-wing Freedom Party, which has links to former Nazis? NELSON: Well, there are two reasons, really. For one thing is that he just collapsed the existing government. I mean, he basically called it quits with the center-left partners they had - the Social Democrats. So it doesn't really make much sense to partner with the Social Democrats, who are coming in either second or third of - the vote count is still going on. Plus, Kurz campaigned on Austrian insecurity, which he links to uncontrolled immigration of refugees. For example, the big wave that came to Austria and the rest of Europe in 2015. He also has been pretty strict about Islam and Muslims here. He helped pass a burka ban. He's a strong advocate for making all immigrants and refugees in Austria fit in or get out. And this Freedom Party - the one with the Nazi links that we're talking about - has a similar platform. And, in fact, it accuses Kurz of co-opting their position, even though their message is much harsher and more xenophobic. But what's a clear - what's really clear from today's vote is that a majority of Austrian voters appear to have embraced this anti-Islam, anti-refugee message. So a partnership between these two could make sense. MARTIN: Soraya, we only have about a minute left. So before we let you go, has there been reaction from outside Austria to these results? NELSON: Well, the World Jewish Congress was quick to criticize the fact that Austrians have given the Freedom Party more than 25 percent of the vote. In a statement, the Jewish organization's president, Robert Lauder, says that the faction is full of, quote, \"xenophobes and racists,\" and that he hopes that the Freedom Party doesn't end up in the government. But Kurz's ally, Gernot Bluemel, who heads the People Party in Vienna, dismisses fears, saying anyone his faction partners with will be kept in check. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) GERNOT BLUEMEL: The crucial point is we are pro-European, so we would never accept an anti-European course in government coalition. We would never accept an anti-Semitic course in government - never, ever, ever. NELSON: The foreign minister, Kurz, meanwhile, says that he'll talk to all winning parties before deciding. MARTIN: Thanks, Soraya. NELSON: You're welcome. Copyright \u00a9 2017 NPR.  All rights reserved.  Visit our website terms of use and permissions pages at www.npr.org for further information.

            "article_content": "Sebastian Kurz, Austria's foreign minister and leader of the conservative Austrian People's Party (OeVP), arrives at his party headquarters on Oct. 13 in Vienna. The OeVP is currently leading in polls.\n                \n                    \n                    Sean Gallup/Getty Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption Sebastian Kurz, Austria's foreign minister and leader of the conservative Austrian People's Party (OeVP), arrives at his party headquarters on Oct. 13 in Vienna. The OeVP is currently leading in polls. Update, 12:10 p.m., ET: Preliminary results show Austrian voters have given the right-leaning party of their 31-year-old foreign minister a mandate to form the next government, but not enough to run Austria without partnering with another party. Sebastian Kurz, who is likely to become the next Austrian chancellor, would be Europe's youngest leader. The popular foreign minister is said to be an avid hiker and windsurfer. At a campaign appearance Oct. 13 in his hometown of Vienna, young people jostled to get close to Kurz, a scene Austrian journalist Gernot Bauer says is quite common. The irony is not lost on the right-wing nationalist Freedom Party of Austria, which preliminary results show had its best results in history and was the second highest vote getter. Nevertheless Kurz could ask the Freedom Party to join him in governing as his party appears to have failed to get a majority of the votes. That prospect drew criticism from top Jewish leaders, including the World Jewish Congress. (WJC) \"It is sad and distressing that such a platform should receive more than a quarter of the vote and become the country's second party,\" said WJC president Ronald S. Lauder.\"It is still full of xenophobes and racists and is, mildly put, very ambiguous toward Austria's Nazi past. My only hope is that they won't end up in government.\" A rock star campaign that was 20 percent selfies \"He's like a pop star,\" said Bauer, who is national desk editor at the Austrian news magazine Profil. \"He's like Justin Bieber, it takes hours (and) people want to make selfies with him. I think 20 percent of his campaign was just making photos and selfies. And this is also something that is a little bit criticized, because we don't know much about him.\" What is known is that Kurz's center-right Austrian People's Party had consistently led in opinion polls since he took over in May. He grew up in the working-class Vienna neighborhood of Meidling, where he still lives. His mother was a teacher and his father was a manager, said his friend and fellow party official, Gernot Bluemel. \"He was raised with the idea that if you work hard, if you play by the rules, then you can achieve your goals you can realize your dream,\" said Bluemel, who heads the Vienna branch of the Austrian People's Party. \"In a country where the level of taxes is being raised higher and higher, this dream is becoming more and more unrealistic.\" Kurz is determined \"to make this dream possible again,\" Bluemel added. Kurz has hard stance on refugees and immigration The foreign minister has worked hard to rebrand his political party as an agent for change, even though it's been part of the Austrian government for the past three decades. Its new moniker is the \"New People's Party,\" and the faction's traditional black color has been replaced with a more trendy turquoise. What hasn't changed is Kurz's hard stance on refugees and immigration. In 2015, he vehemently opposed opening European Union borders to a million mostly Muslim asylum seekers and migrants, who streamed into Austria and points north and west. Such uncontrolled immigration causes security problems for Austria, he said during the recent Vienna campaign stop. Kurz also supports curbing benefits for new arrivals, and making them learn German and adapt to local customs. \"He introduced 'integration by effort,' so that everybody is welcome here in Austria who is willing to make a contribution, to work for himself, to pay taxes, to play by the rules,\" Bluemel said. \"And that was a way that was not so common in Austria then, but he made it popular.\" A strong economy, but an election focused on change During the recent campaign stop, Kurz told the crowd: \"Please give us your vote so we have the power to make real change.\" Bauer said change has been the mantra of this election, even though the Austrian economy is booming, jobs are up and unemployment is down. The election is being held a year earlier than originally scheduled after the current governing coalition fell apart. \"Maybe like everywhere in Europe, there's a feeling of insecurity over globalization,\" Bauer explained. Austrian parents used to say their children were better off than they were, \"and now all the polls say that for the first time, parents are afraid their children might not be as well off as they are. \"Austria is a rich country. We don't have so many big problems, but still there is a desire for change \u2014 and Sebastian Kurz, he symbolizes this desire for change because he's fresh, though he is the longest serving minister in the actual government right now.\" European leaders nervously watching Austria's election The last time the two parties formed a government in Austria in 2000, objections to the Freedom Party \u2014 which originally was headed by a former Nazi \u2014 spurred widespread international criticism and EU sanctions. But such a backlash is not likely this time, as the party has toned down its approach and more EU member state governments are shifting to the right. Bluemel added Kurz and their party will keep any coalition partner in check. \"The crucial point is we are pro-European,\" Bluemel said. \"So we would never accept an anti-European course in the government coalition. We would never accept an anti-Semitic course in government. Never, ever, ever.\" Still, many European leaders are nervously watching Sunday's election, especially because Austria is scheduled to take over the EU presidency next year.",

The Chinese artist Ai Weiwei is internationally recognized for his massive, often provocative art installations. And yet, he's spent most of the past decade under house arrest for his persistent defense of free expression. But as soon as his passport was reissued by the Chinese government a couple of years ago, Ai embarked on possibly his most ambitious project yet: documenting the global refugee crisis. The result of his cinematic journey, Human Flow, is out this week. Ai spoke with NPR about his new documentary, which aims to describe what's become the largest forced migration since World War II \u2014 65 million people displaced by war, famine and climate change. But instead of following the experience of any one group of asylum seekers, Ai takes a more expansive tack, traveling to 23 different countries over the stretch of a year. Employing drone views, the film charts the journeys of divergent populations, including Syrians, Kenyans, Kurds, Palestinians and the Rohingya. It's a theme that also hits home for the Chinese dissident, having grown up in isolation with his poet father, who was exiled from China. \"Being a refugee is much more than a political status,\" Ai says. \"As a human being, if you sit in front of any of them, if you look in their eyes, you immediately understand who they are.\" On seeing himself as a refugee I was born after the year my father was criticized as an enemy of the people. In China, that's the biggest crime you can have. My father is simply a poet, a very well-known poet. So he had been exiled [and] I grew up with him in a very remote area, the desert actually, in northwest China. So I personally experienced how people have been mistreated and, of course, also really punished, for the crime he never really committed. So I share this kind of sentiment of people who miss everything and lost everything. On what it means to be a refugee Being a refugee is much more than a political status. It is the most pervasive kind of cruelty that can be exercised against a human being. By depriving a person of all forms of security, the most basic requirements of a normal life, by cruelly placing that person of inhospitable host countries that do not want to receive this refugee. You are forcibly robbing this human being of all aspects that would make life, not just tolerable, but meaningful in many ways. On what his film adds to the discussion on the refugee crisis As a human being, if you sit in front of any of them, if you look in their eyes, you immediately understand who they are. They are just like your brothers or your sisters or your own children or your grandma. It's nothing different. It's only something you can see from their eyes. They have courage. They can give up everything, just for safety or shelter, or to see their children's future maybe will change because they take this action. On his feelings for people who fear migrants I have great sympathy for them, for the lacking of knowledge, and as a result, lacking of the understanding of humanity, and also [how they] underestimate their own possibilities to help another person, which can be considered as the highest ritual in many, many religions \u2014 just helping someone. Never to say this is too big or it's not my problem. I do have a great, deepest sympathy for people who don't have a clear vision about the world and about themselves, [and] don't understand the value of life.",

Two days after the German parliamentary election, the country is still absorbing the results \u2014 especially the gains made by the Alternative for Germany (AfD), the first far-wing party to win seats in Parliament since the 1950s. Chancellor Angela Merkel has said Germany will have a new coalition government in place by Christmas. Her victory was widely expected, but her Christian Democratic Union (CDU) party suffered a significant loss. Of the 13 percent of Germans who supported the anti-immigrant AfD, more than 1 million were former CDU voters. And many of the AfD's votes came from the eastern part of the country. \"In east Germany, the AfD has been twice as strong as in west Germany. This shows that the voting behavior is much more volatile there and that many citizens in the east feel insecure,\" says Eckhard Jesse, a political scientist and one of the leading experts on extremism research in Germany. \"After more than 25 years of reunification, they [still] feel like second-class citizens.\" The election highlighted a deep divide between Germany's east and west, following the lines of where the Iron Curtain once stood. In the region encompassing what used to be Communist East Germany, the German Democratic Republic, AfD support was the second-highest among all parties. In some areas, it came in first. Male voters in this region gave the AfD more votes than any other party. Anger in the east over Merkel's refugee policies \"was decisive,\" Jesse says. Merkel opened Germany to more than a million migrants and refugees starting in 2015. \"Although Merkel herself is from the east, the frustration there is considerable,\" Jesse says. \"People feel like they are not appreciated, particularly when compared to what they perceive as so much being done for the refugees. This strikes many as unfair when they have worked so hard for the last 27 years in East Germany. It is a feeling of being left behind.\" 'If you feel like a loser, you look for someone to blame' Voters in the eastern part of Germany generally do not identify with one particular party as much as those in the west, he says, and two-thirds of all AfD voters cast their ballots in protest. Their voting choice, Jesse says, \"speaks more about frustration than it does about acceptance of the AfD.\" Gert Wagner, an economist and social scientist at the German Institute for Economic Research, says the standard of living in the east, where \"salaries are lower and the unemployment rate is slightly higher,\" also translated to AfD votes. The east, he says, has seen fewer immigrants than the west. Germans in the east \"have not been used to living in a multicultural society,\" he says. \"That is why it has been relatively easy in East Germany for the AfD to define foreigners as responsible\" for economic hardship and other difficulties. \"If you feel like a loser,\" he says, \"you look for someone to blame.\" An election campaign poster for the right-wing Alternative for Germany hangs in Dresden, in Germany's east.\n                \n                    \n                    Jens Schlueter/Getty Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption An election campaign poster for the right-wing Alternative for Germany hangs in Dresden, in Germany's east. Joachim Ragnitz, the managing director of the Institute for Economic Research in Dresden, says the region's historical past may also help explain why the AfD proved attractive to voters there: \"Many people in East Germany have not yet understood that democracy thrives on pluralism,\" he says. \"This makes them more vulnerable to accepting easy and autocratic messages.\" A 'sentiment of estrangement' Jackson Janes, president of the American Institute for Contemporary German Studies, says there are similarities between American supporters of President Trump and Germany's AfD voters, especially in the \"loss of trust in political institutions and greater attraction to a more emotional political pitch. Also, the core of the support for both is found in rural environments populated by those seen as having been left behind in terms of infrastructure, jobs and challenges to traditional identity factors.\" Ultimately, he says, it is \"the combination of economic disadvantage, cultural dissonance and political alienation that creates the desire to express such frustration not by identifying with a program, but rather identifying with a catalyst, like Trump. Or in eastern Germany, with a backlash.\" Toralf Staud, a German journalist who closely follows right-wing extremism, says some people in the former East Germany \"still do not look at the Federal Republic of Germany as their country. There is a significant sentiment of estrangement.\" That must be taken seriously, he believes. and unequal treatment should be corrected. For example, retirement payments in the former East Germany are less than in the western part of the country. \"These injustices should be taken care of,\" he says. \"But all of this needs to be accompanied by a narrative such as 'You belong to us. You have a say.' \" Simon Schuetz, a political reporter for the German daily Bild, is an Arthur F. Burns Fellow.",

On a recent Thursday afternoon, about a dozen men and women from Afghanistan, Syria, France, Germany and elsewhere milled about awkwardly while Lierenfeld waltzed among them and gave out hugs. After some warmup games, they broke off into groups to perform skits. A big part of improv involves trying on new versions of oneself \u2014 an activity that, in their regular lives, can come with high stakes. Sophia Lierenfeld, 28, leads an improvisational theater class for Germans and refugees. Abulhusn has been attending her weekly Improv Without Borders class and signed up for coaching in flirtation.\n                \n                    \n                    Jacobia Dahm for NPR\n                    \n                \nhide caption Sophia Lierenfeld, 28, leads an improvisational theater class for Germans and refugees. Abulhusn has been attending her weekly Improv Without Borders class and signed up for coaching in flirtation. Gulahmad Gafuri, a medical student from Afghanistan, spoke hesitantly, if at all, until Lierenfeld assigned him a skit to tell a childhood anecdote in an improvised nonsense language. In the made-up language, it turned out he had tons to say. Raghd Hadid, a 19-year-old from Damascus wearing a headscarf, said she was there to practice \"a future self\" where she is \"strong, not weak, not shy.\" And then there's Aktham Abulhusn. What he really wants is to find a girlfriend. Unlike the other Syrian refugees in the workshop, Abulhusn is not Muslim. He's Druze, which makes him an unlikely prospect for most of the Syrian Muslim women he meets in Germany. Druze are a minority group in Syria, and in Berlin, the pool is even smaller. Abulhusn would be happy to date a German girl \u2014 if one of them would only give him a chance. Abulhusn's journey: The life of Abu Techno There was a time in Abulhusn's life when finding love seemed like too much of a risk. For years in Syria \u2014 when Abulhusn went by the name of Abu Techno \u2014 he had good friends who were girls, but he avoided getting too serious with them. He had earned his DJ-esque nickname because of his proficiency with the hidden cameras that he used to film uprisings in al-Sweida, his hometown. Al-Sweida was then fiercely loyal to President Bashar Assad, and these videos exposed early dissent from within the president's political base. Abulhusn says if government agents had discovered his cameras hidden in pens and watches, he wouldn't be alive today. So during this dangerous period, he made a decision about his love life: He wouldn't have one. Lierenfeld teaches her weekly improv class for Germans and refugees in a theater in Berlin's hip Mitte district. Most of the attendees have been coming since the spring.\n                \n                    \n                    Jacobia Dahm for NPR\n                    \n                \nhide caption Lierenfeld teaches her weekly improv class for Germans and refugees in a theater in Berlin's hip Mitte district. Most of the attendees have been coming since the spring. He had seen families suffer when their loved ones were arrested. Or worse, wives were arrested to force their husbands to turn themselves in. As a young man, Abulhusn went to co-ed parties (which, he says, were very chaste) and had friends who were girls. But good friendships have a way of escalating into marriage proposals \u2014 and he always put a brake on it before they did. Abulhusn fled Syria in 2014 after he was detained a second time by authorities and he feared for his safety. He has advantages of which most refugees can only dream. Accepted to a master's program in electrical engineering in a German university, he arrived legally, on a plane, and spent his first year in intense language study. To make sure he wouldn't be sent back to Syria, he reapplied for a refugee visa. It took a while, but his life is finally starting to look less rocky. He tends bar at his university. He speaks highly proficient English and German. But if one thing is harder in peaceful Berlin than in war-torn Syria, it is navigating the lexicon of relationships. Abulhusn has tried online dating. He has gone on outings a Facebook group arranged to introduce refugees and locals. (It was from that group that he learned about Improv Without Borders.) Last year, he fell into a conversation with a German medical student who asked him for his number, and they even went on one date together to see a soccer match with some of her friends. He liked her \u2014 thought she was cute \u2014 and she was intensely curious about Syria. He had high hopes. Abulhusn (center, in red shirt) loves to walk in the busy spaces of the city, where he enjoys people-watching and listening to music.  \n\n                    \n                    Jacobia Dahm for NPR\n                    \n                \nhide caption Abulhusn (center, in red shirt) loves to walk in the busy spaces of the city, where he enjoys people-watching and listening to music. But after a couple of exchanges, his texts went unanswered. Doing a postmortem on a date gone bad can be maddening for anyone. Was it my hair? My breath? Something I said? But the spiral of questions can be even more desperate if you're a foreigner. Abulhusn couldn't help but wonder: Had he done something culturally inappropriate? Or was his refugee status itself a blemish? Despite all his efforts to toe the line, were women associating him with the sexual predator stereotype of refugee men that Germans read about in the news, a trope that got frequent play during this year's presidential election? The love audit Lierenfeld, the improv teacher, watches Abulhusn become looser and more outgoing week by week. But he tells her he can't seem to translate that relaxed workshop version of himself into ordinary life. So Lierenfeld, 28, offers to give him a flirt coaching session \u2014 the chance to brutally break down his game and show him how to improve it. They arrange to meet at a downtown coffee shop in Berlin's hip district of Mitte. At their tiny, square table, they look like one more couple on a date. Lierenfeld says she likes her sessions to be as realistic as possible. Abulhusn tells her about his puzzling failure with the med student, and Lierenfeld tells him to give her his phone. She wants to see the text exchange for herself. Abulhusn performs at a class at Improv Without Borders, a program he attends every week to gain self-confidence.\n                \n                    \n                    Jacobia Dahm for NPR\n                    \n                \nhide caption Abulhusn performs at a class at Improv Without Borders, a program he attends every week to gain self-confidence. As he hunts for the texts, Lierenfeld gets right down to business: \"Can you tell me about the whole sex stuff? Do you have some one-night stands in Berlin?\" Abulhusn admits that he's a virgin, \"even by kissing.\" He's never kissed a girl on the mouth, he says. \"Wow,\" Lierenfeld says. Abulhusn says he believes that there are no important cultural differences between himself and the women he wants to date in Germany. He values things like mutual respect and honesty and equal rights for women \u2014 he was raised to believe that in his Druze community, he says. But in Germany, the simple fact of his virginity will itself prove to be a divide. Lierenfeld studies the texts from the medical student and delivers what is obvious to her, but surprising to Abulhusn. \"From her messages,\" she explains, \"she seemed to be really interested in sex with you. That's obvious to me. She's inviting you to cook together, which means you're already at her place.\" She tells Abulhusn the problem was probably not that he'd done anything wrong or inappropriate. He'd just failed to \"make a move.\" The medical student probably felt rejected and cut him off. \"But truthfully, I would feel scared to suggest such a thing,\" Abulhusn says. \"If she says, 'Oh God, he's just trying to get me to bed, and I'm just trying to be nice because he's a refugee.' \" When she's not leading a workshop, Lierenfeld works as a \"flirt coach\" \u2014 helping clients become more confident in flirting with women. She and Abulhusn (left) had a recent session. \n\n                    \n                    Jacobia Dahm/NPR\n                    \n                \nhide caption When she's not leading a workshop, Lierenfeld works as a \"flirt coach\" \u2014 helping clients become more confident in flirting with women. She and Abulhusn (left) had a recent session. He'd be mortified to be lumped in with the refugee stereotype of a man \"who is always harassing girls,\" he says. Lierenfeld gathers her thoughts. \"I'm going to say this in a bit of a mean way,\" she says. \"Do you understand your arrogance here? I understand your feelings, but there's one part of what you're saying that is really arrogant \u2014 which is that you have to think and decide for her. She's a grown-up person.\" Abulhusn looks shocked. \"I never thought of that in this way!\" he says. \"That's why I said it in such a straight way,\" Lierenfeld says. As a traveler in a foreign country, it can be easier to figure out what not to do than what to do. Abulhusn understands that \"no means no.\" His problem is almost the opposite: He's too protective of women to comfortably flirt with them. Abulhusn says that this time with Lierenfeld transformed the way he sees himself. He now makes it a point to try not to cross his arms when he's talking to women. And if during all these years in Germany he's been afraid to come across as dangerous, now he thinks a bit more about how to make himself feel safe.",

            "article_content": "Chancellor Angela Merkel has won another term as Germany's head of state and Germany's right-wing party, Alternative for Germany, has won dozens of seats in Parliament.  DAVID GREENE, HOST: We want to turn now to our co-host, Rachel Martin, who is in Berlin reporting this morning on the German elections. RACHEL MARTIN, HOST: We are here in Berlin in our studios overlooking the Brandenburg Gate, and it is a new day here in Germany. A big thing remains the same - Angela Merkel will remain as the chancellor, but there is a very significant change to the German political landscape this morning because for the first time in 60 years, a right-wing party has won enough votes to get into Parliament. The party is called the AfD, and it stands for Alternative for Germany. It is a nationalist party that has taken a very hard line on immigration. Party officials say Germany has too many immigrants who aren't doing enough to integrate into German society. I talked with a cab driver last night who voted for the AfD. His name is Peter Sabatowski (ph), and he's 61 years old, and I asked him if immigration had played a role in his vote. This is what he said. PETER SABATOWSKI: Absolute, absolute (speaking German). MARTIN: You can hear him there say absolutely, but I also have to say - this is what he said - I am not a Nazi. I am not a racist. He went on to say Germany should help refugees, people fleeing war, but too many mistakes have been made. So immigration has been a huge issue, as we've said. With me here in our studios in Berlin, NPR's Soraya Sarhaddi Nelson, who has been watching all of this unfold. Soraya, in the end, what was the AfD's message that ended up drawing so much support from German voters? SORAYA SARHADDI NELSON, BYLINE: They were basically telling people take Germany back, have enough faith in yourself and in us to take Germany back. And they managed to convince people that immigrants were the source of all their problems, especially this big wave of refugees that came since 2015. And... MARTIN: We should say more than a million in two years. NELSON: More than a million since then, exactly. It's clear that that was something that really resonated, but it's also important to remember that it's actually a protest vote as well. Sixty percent of exit polls suggested that people were voting for AfD to sort of show their protest. MARTIN: And what does it mean that they're now in Parliament? How much power will they have? NELSON: They will be - if they will be the main opposition - if they are the main opposition, they will have more power. They'll be the main rebuttal force, but otherwise, they will be in Parliament as an opposition party, which will give them some legitimacy but not as much as if they were the - actually the main opposition, which they may not be the way things are going. MARTIN: All right. At the very least, a bigger megaphone. Moments ago, we spoke with Wolfgang Ischinger who is the former deputy foreign minister for Germany. He also served as the German ambassador to the U.S. And he said the good news, as he sees it, is that Germans voted for continuity by electing Merkel to a fourth term. He said the bad news is that the right wing is on the rise. WOLFGANG ISCHINGER: It's a very serious problem for a nation that has this terrible history of far-right movement. We need to be particularly sensitive to the far right and what it might want to do. So Germany is different in that sense from, you know, Switzerland or Spain or so. But then on the other hand, the AfD, even if they obtain 13 percent this time, they are still not of the same quantity, of the same importance as, say, Marine Le Pen was in France. So I'm glad to say that even though this is a serious challenge, Germany will have a stable government and will continue its essentially pro-European and pro-transatlantic policy approaches. MARTIN: Angela Merkel now wins a fourth term, cementing her position as the longest-serving leader in Europe. She has staked out a position as Europe's strongest counterpoint to President Trump in the United States. She said after Trump's election, Europe needs to take its, quote, \"own destiny into its own hands,\" suggesting that the relationship between the U.S. and Europe was going to change. Is President Trump going to be a reliable partner for her moving forward? ISCHINGER: Well, let me rephrase your question, if I may. Is the United States a reliable partner? MARTIN: You see those as two separate questions. ISCHINGER: I think that in this current situation with President Trump in the White House, we here in Europe, we need to understand that the United States is more than President Trump. There are 50 governors. There is the Congress. In other words, we will have to work with all these constituent parts of the American political system, not only with the White House. I call this the doughnut policy. If the hole in the middle is the White House with which we can't work, we go to the parts around it. MARTIN: But you describe the Trump administration as a hole in American governance. ISCHINGER: No, no, no, I'm saying that if the White House is not the partner with whom we can do or achieve the goals which we want to achieve, we will want to lobby as hard as we can senators and congressmen to make sure that if that decision happens, the negative fallout will hopefully, you know, be reduced by the Congress to a degree that we can tolerate. MARTIN: If I could ask you to take a big step back and look more globally, could you characterize Germany's role in a world where the U.S. is pulling back and in a world where Russia is exerting more influence? ISCHINGER: For Germany, the lesson of the 20th century and the lesson of the last couple of decades since our reunification was achieved is the classic nation state isn't going to be able to provide the answers to the global issues that we are currently confronting and that we will be confronting even more in the future. So our answer in the heart of Europe has got to be more, not less Europe, better Europe, more respected European Union. Why can't 500 million Europeans not speak up more strongly on important issues in the world? Whether it's Syria, whether it's Ukraine, in a world where we have now a world record of 65 million refugees, I think the EU deserves to build up its capacity as an international actor. And that is, I think, what Chancellor Merkel talks about when she says maybe we've got to take a little more responsibility on our own. She is not saying Germany needs to do this. I think she is thinking about the European Union with Germany as an important anchor. MARTIN: That's Wolfgang Ischinger, the former German ambassador to the U.S. Germans this morning coming to terms with the results of their election here - Angela Merkel re-elected to a fourth term; the right-wing party, the AfD, elected into Parliament, the first time a right-wing party has achieved that foothold in Parliament in 60 years. Merkel now works to form a new coalition government. She said that might take until the end of the year before she can make that happen. Negotiations are underway. Copyright \u00a9 2017 NPR.

Although exit polls from Sunday's German elections say Angela Merkel will remain chancellor for a fourth term, the result Germany is talking about is that of nationalist right-wing party Alternative for Germany, or AfD. The AfD has not only entered the German parliament for the first time, but it's also succeeded in being strongest of the smaller German parties, making them the third-biggest party in the incoming legislature. Having failed to enter the Bundestag in the last election, the party is now likely to have nearly 100 seats in parliament. Despite coming in first, Merkel\u00b4s Christian Democratic Union lost significant support, achieving their worst result since 1949. Her challenger, Martin Schulz, from the Social Democrats, led his party to its worst result since the founding of the German Federal Republic. Schultz said he would not go into another grand coalition with Merkel, preferring to rebuild his party as the leader of the opposition instead. Merkel is now expected to try to build a new coalition with the Liberals and the Green party. Growing success The success of the AfD is even bigger than most polls had predicted. It's the first time since the Second World War that a party professing such xenophobic, anti-immigrant and anti-Islamic views has been voted into the Bundestag. Their campaign centered on being the voice of Germans who are angry about the number of asylum-seekers allowed into the country in the past two years. They also attacked what they called \"political correctness,\" saying they will not accept anyone ordering them to be quiet, proclaiming the end of the era of political correctness. Some members have espoused the values of the extreme right, and one of its co-leaders, Alexander Gauland said publically that Germany should be proud of its past and the achievements of its soldiers in two world wars. Another reason for the AfD's success is their strong online election campaign, helped by a Texas political strategy firm that critics accuse of introducing negative campaign tactics to an extent not previously seen in Germany. Moreover, the AfD has been successful in casting themselves as victims of the political establishment and the mainstream media. One of their main candidates, Alice Weidel, stormed out of a public TV debate during the campaign, claiming she was being treated unfairly. The AfD also succeeded in making itself a consistent headline during the campaign, using targeted acts of provocation to ensure TV news coverage. Constanze Stelzenmueller, a political scientist currently at the Brookings Institution, gave NPR an early analysis. \"The AfD's success has many parents,\" she says. \"A too-placid campaign by the governing coalition and its chancellor, Angela Merkel; the grand coalition's inability to address the concerns of German citizens about integrating refugees; and a ferocious AfD campaign on social media and in the streets.\" A vote against the establishment According to public broadcaster ARD, 60 percent of AfD voters say their vote has been triggered by disappointment with the established parties, while 31 percent cast their ballot for the AfD based on political conviction. Between 90 and 99 percent of AfD voters say the party understands the issues they care about better than the other parties. They say Germans do not feel safe anymore, they want to decrease the influence of Islam in Germany and limit the influx of refugees. Asked for their main concerns, AfD voters said they were afraid of Germany losing its culture, and that the influence of Islam would force great changes in German life. They also feared an increase in crime rates, and demanded that the country do more to secure its national borders. Merkel\u00b4s immigration policies divided the country The migration crisis might have been less of a topic in recent months, but it has changed the political atmosphere in Germany. During the campaign, Chancellor Merkel often faced right-wing protestors at her public appearances. One-hundred percent of AfD voters disapprove of Merkel's actions during the migration crisis, and are not convinced that her political decisions will improve things in the future. Looking at the composition of the AfD electorate, it's apparent that the party was very successful in mobilizing former non-voters. Almost 1.2 million AfD voters were previously non-voters, while the second-biggest group of AfD voters, more than 1 million strong, previously supported Merkel's party, the CDU. Even the Social Democrats lost about half a million voters to the AfD. Speaking from Berlin on Sunday evening, Jackson Janes, president of the American Institute for Contemporary German Studies, told NPR that the AfD's feat was a result of \"a mixture of fear, fatigue and frustration: a mobilized fear of immigrants, fatigue after 12 years of Merkel in office, and frustration with political party leaders who don't seem to be listening to voters' concerns.\" Although all of the other parties in the German parliament have said they will not cooperate with the AfD, its arrival in the Bundestag amounts to a political earthquake in German politics. As one sign that the atmosphere in Germany's calm, consensus-seeking parliament is about to change, AfD leader Alice Weidel says her party will demand a committee of inquiry against Angela Merkel, to investigate possible breaches of law by the chancellor during the migration crisis.",

Preliminary results show German voters gave Chancellor Angela Merkel a mandate for a fourth term Sunday, but with far fewer votes than needed for her to govern without forming a coalition. Merkel had campaigned on her record as a highly respected leader not only in Germany, but also internationally, as well as record low unemployment and strong economic growth. But German unhappiness over her refugee policy that allowed more than a million asylum seekers into the country since 2015 was something she never fully recovered from. \"Merkel has become a very polarizing figure, something she never envisioned for herself, never saw happening,\" said Merkel biographer Stefan Kornelius, who is also foreign editor of Germany's daily Suedeutsche Zeitung.  \"As much as she pushed to the center on the refugee issue and brought in the left part of electoral voters in her camp,\" she lost voters to the right of the spectrum. Those voters are among the many Germans who are sending a right-wing nationalist party to the German parliament for the first time since 1957. Preliminary results show Alternative for Germany, which was founded as a euroskeptic party in 2013, coming in third place with about 13 percent of the vote. Merkel has made it clear that her center-right Christian Democratic Union will under no circumstances partner with AfD. She and most other German politicians dismiss the newer party as anti-Muslim, anti-immigrant and even anti-Semitic. Last January, one of AfD's prominent eastern German leaders, Bjoern Hoecke, called the Holocaust Memorial the \"memorial of shame and suggested Germans should \"make a 180-degree turn in their politics of commemoration.\" Who will join Merkel in her new government is unclear and may not be decided for weeks. Another party voted into the new German parliament is the Social Democrats, with the second-most votes but what appears to be its poorest showing in many decades. The party leader is former European Parliament President Martin Schulz, who had hoped to replace Merkel and ran on a social justice platform aimed at easing income disparity and improving social benefits and education. The center-left party was a junior partner in Merkel's most recent government, but both sides are lukewarm about joining forces again. The business-friendly Free Democratic Party, which some analysts say drew voters away from Merkel, the Greens and The Left Party \u2013 the latter is the successor to the East German communists \u2014 also have cleared the 5 percent vote threshold to enter parliament. Voter turnout Sunday was estimated to be about 75 percent compared with 71.5 percent who cast ballots in the last German federal elections four years ago. Berlin voter Bernd Lauer called it a critical year for Germans, who've seen more than a million asylum seekers come here since 2015. \"The refugee topic is very important, but also how Germany will evolve in the future in terms of digitalization,\" he said. \"The education is another important topic so I think there are a lot of topics this year around that might influence people's vote.\" Berlin retiree Werner Butz \u2014 who, like Lauer, declined to say whom he voted for \u2014 said his choice was based on his worry about the declining value of pensions, ensuring German security and capping the number of asylum seekers allowed into Germany. \"A state can only take in as many refugees as it can handle economically,\" he said. \"Taking more than that will only cause the German population to go under. And that's a real danger right now.\" Many Germans share his fear that immigrants might take away jobs and benefits, a fear stoked by Alternative for Germany. It helped the 4-year-old party siphon off many conservative Merkel supporters as well as voters in the former communist eastern Germany, where unemployment tends to be higher and incomes lower than the German average. While the current inclination is for Merkel and other mainstream parliament members to isolate their right-wing counterparts, they won't be able to ignore them completely. Even before the federal election, AfD has steered the debate on asylum seekers from one over integration into German society to one focused on increasing and speeding up deportations. The right-wing nationalists also won seats in 13 of 16 German state legislatures. There is one thing Merkel and AfD more or less agree on, and that is the need to engage the Trump administration. The right-wing nationalists have said they see a kindred spirit in President Trump, even if AfD's lead candidate Alice Weidel at a recent news conference criticized his Twitter habit.

            "article_content": "Even if German Chancellor Merkel is re-elected Sunday, there's no guarantee it will be business as usual. Also, a Senate campaign in Alabama is exposing division between Trump and other Republicans.  DAVID GREENE, HOST: I'm David Greene in Culver City, Ca. And, Rachel Martin, I'm a little jealous. It sounds like you don't have a bad view this morning in Berlin. RACHEL MARTIN, HOST: Yeah. That's true. I have been here with our team reporting on Germany's upcoming election. We are here in Berlin, in a studio overlooking the Brandenburg Gate. Obviously, the sight of so many significant events in German history. There are a couple hundred people milling about in the square next to the gate, a whole lot of tourists. By coincidence, David, the Berlin Marathon is happening also on Sunday, which is voting day. So the city is packed, a whole lot of energy around. I can also see the Dome of the Bundestag. This is the Parliament building. And voters, when they go to the polls, are going to choose who they want to sit in that building, which party and which chancellor they want to lead them. GREENE: And you are not running in the marathon, we should make clear. You're there to cover politics. MARTIN: Very clear. Yeah, definitely not running. GREENE: Well, so in the election, Chancellor Angela Merkel is running - right? - for another term in office? MARTIN: She is running for another term. This would be huge if she wins. And she is set to win. And her party, the CDU, this would be her fourth term. And there's just been all this change in Europe since she came into office 12 years ago - obviously, the global recession, more recently, the U.K. leaving the EU and the Brexit vote, increased threat from terrorism. And through it all, Merkel has really been the stabilizing force. She's kept the German economy on track. And amidst all the populous political movements around Europe and the U.S., she has been seen as the champion of liberal democracy and the de facto leader of Europe. GREENE: You know, those political movements around Europe, I mean, they have been driven so much by this issue of immigration. It's been a big issue here in the United States. It's been a big issue across Europe. And considering the refugee crisis, I mean, this has to be a big deal in this election as well there? MARTIN: Yeah, it's huge. Angela Merkel got a whole lot of criticism for opening Germany's borders. When the refugee crisis was at its apex back in 2005. And all these refugees were flooding into the country mainly from Syria. And Germany, as a country, is having to grapple with how to integrate all these people. Are there enough resources for them? And this has really led the push from the far-right here. There's a party that's doing quite well in the polls. It's called the AfD, the Alternative fuer Deutschland. And they are running on a very hard-line immigration platform, especially immigration from Muslim countries. They are - they've got these posters all around town, campaign posters. They're meant to be provocative. One of them, it's got a couple of women, their backs dressed in bikinis. And it says on the poster, essentially, we want bikinis, not burkas. There's another one of this pregnant woman who is clearly a white German. She's in the middle of giving birth, believe it or not, on this poster. And the slogan on there is, we can make our own Germans. We can make our own people. I sat down with the head of the AfD in Berlin, the party chair in Berlin. And he was feeling pretty confident about his party's position. JORG MEUTHEN: I'm very confident, yeah - and because we are about to become the third-strongest party in Germany. MARTIN: So if they meet this threshold, get into Parliament, it would be the first time since the end of World War II that a far-right nationalist party has had such representation here. GREENE: All right. Well, Rachel, I'm really excited to hear all of your reporting. It sounds like fascinating stuff in Germany. For the moment, I want to turn our attention to an election here in the United States. And it's really, I mean, this interesting political battle that involves President Trump. And it's playing out in Huntsville, Ala. MARTIN: Yeah. So he is heading there this evening to campaign for Luther Strange. Strange was appointed to the U.S. Senate seat that was left open when Jeff Sessions became attorney general. Now, he has to run in a primary next week. And here's the thing. Some top GOP figures and Trump's own supporters have endorsed Strange's Republican challenger, Roy Moore. At a rally for Moore last night, Trump's former adviser, Sebastian Gorka, spoke. And so did one Tea Party hero and Trump ally, Sarah Palin. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) SARAH PALIN: A vote for Judge Moore isn't a vote against the president. It is a vote for the peoples' agenda that elected the president. MARTIN: So what might the divided support in this race mean for Trump's relationship with his base and with the Republican Party? GREENE: Yeah. It's a good question to pose to NPR's Tamara Keith, who is on the line. Hey there, Tam. TAMARA KEITH, BYLINE: Hey. GREENE: So help me figure this out. Roy Moore is seen as the outsider in this race. Luther Strange is seen as the establishment candidate. Why is the president endorsing the establishment candidate when he is so well-known as being an outsider? KEITH: Well, by all accounts, it is based less on politics than on a personal relationship. The president likes Big Luther, as he likes to call him, says he's a good guy. And they talk regularly. President Trump said on Twitter recently, quote, \"I am a big supporter. I'm supporting Big Luther Strange because he was so loyal and helpful to me - exclamation point.\" And it's true. Strange has been a reliable vote in the Senate during his relatively short time there. Moore is the twice former chief justice of the Alabama State Supreme Court, removed from the court for refusing to take a Ten Commandments monument out of the court building, and then more recently, for defying a court order on same-sex marriage. He is unlikely to be so loyal to President Trump in the Senate and has basically run against the majority leader, Mitch McConnell. So he's likely to stir things up. And this comes at a time when Republicans have a very narrow majority in the Senate. So there are reasons for the president to support Strange, even if it is a bit off-brand for Trump. GREENE: Off-brand. What does it mean that Trump has decided to support one candidate and many people, I mean, in his base, I mean, people who supported him are deciding to go a different direction? Does that mean they're not on the same page anymore? KEITH: Not necessarily. You know, one thing about Strange is that he was appointed to the position by the now former governor of Alabama, who had to resign and is wildly unpopular. Also, Strange worked as a lobbyist. So in terms of brand, that's a little swampy. Meanwhile, you've got Steve Bannon, Sebastian Gorka, Sarah Palin, Sean Hannity, all of these people who consider themselves flame keepers of Trumpism backing Moore because it's more on brand. So there is this cognitive dissonance. I was talking to Barry Bennett, who for a time worked on Trump's campaign. He says expect he expects a lot of people to go to this rally tonight, wear their red Make America Great Again hats and then walk right out and vote for Roy Moore. GREENE: All right, listening there to Tamara Keith talk about this interesting Republican primary race in the state of Alabama that may tell us something about President Trump right now in his own base. NPR White House correspondent Tamara Keith. Tam, thanks, as always. KEITH: You're welcome. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) GREENE: It continues to be a sad scene in Mexico. As Mexico wakes up today, they continue laying the dead to rest. MARTIN: Meanwhile, across Mexico City, rescuers are still hoping to find survivors from Tuesday's massive earthquake. The death toll could still rise, but volunteers have rescued at least 60 people. The teams are made up of professionals and volunteers who just want to help. Pola Diaz is a paramedic. And yesterday, as it rained, she was crawling into debris, searching for signs of life. She says, we Mexicans are known for our courage, our big hearts and, above all, our solidarity. GREENE: All right. NPR international correspondent Carrie Kahn has been out with some of these rescue teams. And, Carrie, what's it like to be at the site of these rescue operations? CARRIE KAHN, BYLINE: It's both heartbreaking at times. It's tense. At times, it's heartwarming to see all of the hundreds of volunteers working there. It's just - it's a whole mix of emotions. I was at the site of a seven-story building that collapsed in a neighborhood with severe damage to many of the older picturesque buildings. And I talked with desperate relatives of one couple that had an accounting firm on the fourth floor there. And they've been at the site now - it's been nearly three days - hoping and waiting to hear something from authorities. And there is little information that's being given, which is frustrating to relatives. But, you know, in front of you, you see this huge building with its pancaked floors and rubble and twisted rebar. And you can see rescue workers on top scouring for entryways. You see them bringing in dogs, walking around and sniffing the rubble. I did speak with Pola Diaz that - you just spoke about. And she's just an amazing woman. She's really short in stature, but she's incredibly brave. She's one of these Mexican so-called topos. They're volunteer rescuers. Topos mean moles in Spanish. And like the animal, she crawls into these small spaces in the rubble and searches for survivors. GREENE: I mean, we're talking about three days now since the earthquake struck. Are people moving on and trying to get on with their lives, or are they transfixed by these reports of rescue operations and all this drama? KAHN: I think, again, Pola Diaz really just embodies what everybody's thinking there. She told me very emphatically she's not leaving until every survivor's found. And she said, hope never dies. And that's pretty much the sentiment from the hundreds. But the thing is that the next day or two is really going to be very critical here. They'll have to make a decision soon about when these rescue efforts will turn into recovery. And that's going to be a tough decision to make. It's going to be a tough one for all these hundreds of volunteers there to really accept and to move into this next phase. It's going to have to happen soon. GREENE: And just briefly, I mean, there's this child that people were so desperately trying to rescue at that elementary school. She might never have actually existed or been there? KAHN: No, she did not. A Navy official came out yesterday and said that that was not true. All the children at the school have been accounted for. GREENE: All right. NPR's Carrie Kahn covering the really sad aftermath of that earthquake in Mexico. She's in Mexico City. Carrie, thanks. KAHN: You're welcome.

German Chancellor Angela Merkel and her Christian Democratic Union are poised to win Germany's national elections Sept. 24. But for the first time since the Second World War, Germany's Parliament, the Bundestag, also looks set to include an extreme right-wing party \u2014 the Alternative fuer Deutschland (Alternative for Germany) or AfD. Since its founding in 2013, the party, led by economist Alice Weidel and former CDU politician Alexander Gauland, has been shaking up the German political landscape. It is currently represented in 13 of Germany's 16 state legislative bodies. Polls suggest that among Germany's smaller, less dominant political parties, the AfD is leading with double-digit numbers. It's running third after the CDU and the Social Democratic Party. If the election results in another coalition government, the AfD would become the opposition leader. \"It is worrying,\" says Michael Fuchs, a Christian Democrat Bundestag member since 2002. \"For the first time in the history of the Federal Republic of Germany, there will be a political party within the walls of the Reichstag [Parliament] building which does not distance itself from the Nazi past and which tolerates members who publicly express themselves in racist and xenophobic language.\" Here's what to know about the party and its prospects: What is the AfD? The AfD started four years ago as a conservative populist party, rejecting the euro. It came to greater prominence after Germany's migration crisis began in 2015, and attracted members from mainstream political parties. Since then, it has become more openly racist and anti-Muslim, favoring an anti-immigration agenda. Its leaders have also called on Germany to stop apologizing for \u2014 and indeed to \"be proud of\" \u2014 its Nazi past. Gauland, the AfD's national spokesman, stated earlier this month, \"If the French are rightly proud of their emperor and the Britons of Nelson and Churchill, we have the right to be proud of the achievements of the German soldiers in two world wars.\" The party has turned away from Germany's long-accepted political norms, says Constanze Stelzenmueller, a German political scientist at the Brookings Institution. \"Germany's postwar foreign policy had two lodestars,\" she says, \"atonement for World War II and the Holocaust, as well as reconciliation with its victims and enemies \u2014 and joining the universe of Western democracies, and specifically integration into the U.N., NATO, and the European Union. The AfD more or less explicitly rejects both these orienting principles in favor of an ethno-nationalist, sovereignist, anti-European, anti-American and pro-Russian stance.\" She says the rise of the AfD is in keeping with movements elsewhere in the world, including in the U.S. \"All Western democracies, including the U.S. and Germany, are seeing powerful protest movements ... against globalization and integration,\" she says. \"They are agitating for a recapturing of control, or 'sovereignty,' and often also of ethnic homogeneity. Although they keep talking about the nation-state, they oppose key principles of Western constitutionalism like separation of powers and the protection of minorities against the tyranny of the majority. They want a tribalization of politics. That's something the Tea Party and the U.S. alt-right have in common with the AfD.\" How much power comes with leading the opposition? The opposition leader has a special role in the Parliament, explains Werner Patzelt, political scientist at the University of Dresden: \"There are two advantages to being opposition leader,\" he says. The first is control of the chairmanship of the Committee on Budgets \u2014 which means it influences fiscal policy. Also, Patzelt says, \"The opposition party is ensured the right to respond first to any statement issued by the government, which in turn ensures publicity.\" That publicity \u2014 having a greater national platform for its views \u2014 is what worries many analysts. What are the AfD's likely legislative priorities? The party favors complete closure of Germany's borders, limiting the number of incoming refugees and prohibiting subsequent immigration of family members. It wants Germany to withdraw from the eurozone. And it favors a ban on headscarves. Alexander Hensel, a political scientist of the Institute of Democracy Research in Goettingen, has investigated how AfD representatives have changed state governments so far. The party \"focuses less on constructive and consensus-oriented work,\" he says. \"With its entrance in the state parliaments, political arguments have become more polarized. Substantive debates as well as the tone and the social interaction within the parliamentary debates become more harsh.\" Joerg Meuthen, the opposition leader from the AfD in the state parliament of Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg, tells NPR, \"The debates in parliament have become livelier. We offer a truly alternative political policy draft.\" There is a precedent for populist proposals in German politics, says the University of Dresden's Patzelt. When the Green and Left parties were new to Parliament, they introduced populist bills. \"But in those instances,\" he says, \"left-wing populism was more popular with the media\" than right-wing populism. How will other parties deal with the AfD? All of Germany's political parties have refused to enter into a coalition with the AfD. \"Everything originating from us will be rejected,\" says the AfD's Meuthen, \"just because it does originate from the AfD.\" But legislators are sure the AfD's presence will be felt nevertheless. \"Otherwise opposing parliamentary factions are nonetheless connected, in essence, by what they recognize as a great responsibility to history,\" says Konstantin von Notz, a Green Party Bundestag member since 2009. \"I am convinced that on the very first day of remembrance for the victims of [Nazism], there will be an act of propaganda by the AfD in the Parliament,\" he says. Usually on this day of commemoration, observed every January, members of Parliament stand in honor of victims' memory \u2014 but it's possible, according to von Notz, that AfD members would leave the room. Von Notz fears that the AfD will break with parliamentary consensus \"and fail to behave decently by being civil and respecting one another personally, even if we hold very opposite positions. The neo-fascist-leaning segment of the AfD could revoke this behavioral consensus.\" But Hensel's study of the AfD's effects on state governments suggests that efforts to isolate the AfD will backfire. \"Attempts at formal or symbolic exclusion generally play into the hands of the AfD,\" he says, \"allowing them to cast themselves as sympathetic victims of the other political parties.\" Stelzenmueller of the Brookings Institution warns that the AfD \"will be seeking attention by attempting to provoke as much as possible.\" She offers the following advice: \"Rule No. 1 will be to not fall into this trap. Rule No. 2: Mainstream parties should not allow the AfD to claim sole ownership\" of hot-button issues such as integration of refugees. \"More than ever,\" she says, \"mainstream parties need to stake their own claims and convince voters that theirs are the best policy ideas.\" Drawing on extensive experience, Fuchs, the CDU politician, recommends that those in the majority party should \"demonstrate a clear, contrasting profile toward political opponents within the AfD. Only then shall we succeed in having them eliminated from Parliament once again.\" Simon Schuetz, a political reporter for the German daily Bild, is an Arthur F. Burns Fellow.",

Otto Fricke says he knew what he was getting himself into. When he decided to run for a seat in Germany's parliament, Fricke says he knew that after the elections in the U.S., the Netherlands and France, the next big target for Russian election interference could be his own national election. \"No one in Germany, if you ask the question, 'Do you think that Russia is trying to intervene with the German election in a certain way?' would say no,\" said Fricke, who also served in the legislature from 2002 to 2013. \"The only question is how are they going to do it.\" Strangely and to the surprise of democracy watchers everywhere, the answer has been: lightly. There is evidence that Russian intelligence officers have been up to some of their now-familiar tricks in Germany \u2014 including cyberattacks, spreading disinformation and other strategies \u2014 but nothing has happened on the scale of other elections elsewhere, German politicians and other experts say. \"We have problems with wrong information and right-wing propaganda, but all of them are coming from inside the country,\" said Alexander S\u00e4ngerlaub, who leads a program called Measuring Fake News at the think tank Stiftung Neue Verantwortung in Berlin. It's more difficult for an influence campaign to cause the same kinds of issues with German voters as with Americans, S\u00e4ngerlaub and others said \u2014 for example, the blame being placed in Washington, D.C., on the role Facebook played in 2016. \"Social media isn't so important for the people in Germany for getting information about politics ... And we have a strong media system \u2014 people trust the media and there is not so much craving for alternative media,\" S\u00e4ngerlaub said. Still, many observers expected interference in Germany to be bad. Constanze Stelzenm\u00fcller, the Robert Bosch senior fellow at the Brookings Institute, testified before Congress in June about Russian influence in Germany. It hasn't hit the same level of intensity as it has in other places. The Alliance for Securing Democracy, a bipartisan initiative housed at The German Marshall Fund of the United States, recently started tracking a list of 600 influential propaganda accounts on Twitter to see how they are propelling pro-Russia angles in Germany. The tracker shows an uptick in digital activity since the start of September, but the number of tweets pales in comparison to what was seen in America. The tracker's peak day this month saw 20,012 tweets total, whereas a single fake news story could garner thousands of tweets in just minutes in the summer of 2016, according to testimony given to the Senate Intelligence Committee earlier this year. Stelzenm\u00fcller pointed to laws in Germany prompted by the Holocaust that strictly prohibit hate speech. A new law that goes into effect in October will fine social networks if they don't take down hate speech within 24 hours of a complaint. \"That's not to say there's nothing going on,\" says Stelzenm\u00fcller. \"There appears to be a spike in social media traffic directed at Russian-German voters, which are estimated at 3 to 5 million.\" An examination of the kind of things the accounts are tweeting about, and who they're targeting, suggests one potential Russian strategy. \"Poison the climate\" German voters cast ballots for parties as well as their leaders. One new party in contention in this year's election is the right-wing Alternative for Germany, or AfD, which has polled between 8 percent and 15 percent since last year, when German Chancellor Angela Merkel's acceptance of hundreds of thousands of refugees fueled the party's staunch anti-immigration rhetoric. The party was formed just four years ago and in that time has shifted from a right-leaning populist party to a one that flaunts xenophobia and features a politician who condemned a Holocaust Memorial in Berlin. The party is also unabashedly pro-Russia. If Merkel wins, as now projected, and her Christian Democratic Union party repeats its current coalition with the center-left Social Democrats, the AfD could become the largest \"opposition party\" in the German government. That is a consolation prize, compared with the possibility of defeating Merkel. But in view of her strengths, the Russian influence machine may have chosen a different strategy. The Alliance for Securing Democracy's propaganda tracker consistently finds \"AfD\" as the most-used phrase by the Russian bots it tracks. \"[Germany] is much less polarized than it was in the U.S.,\" said Stefan Meister, who heads the Robert Bosch Center at the German Council on Foreign Relations in Berlin. \"So I think they understand \u2014 the Russian side understands \u2014 that their impact will be limited anyway. So that's why they focus on the right-wing populists, who are the main interrupter here in the political system, just to make them as strong as possible.\" Alexander Gauland and Alice Weidel are the top candidates of the right wing and pro-Russia political party Alternative for Germany. The party is projected to win seats in the lower house of parliament.\n                \n                    \n                    Sean Gallup/Getty Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption Alexander Gauland and Alice Weidel are the top candidates of the right wing and pro-Russia political party Alternative for Germany. The party is projected to win seats in the lower house of parliament. Finishing third in a U.S. presidential election would mean having next to no impact on the national stage after an election, but that is not the case in Germany. If current polls hold, the AfD could end up with more than 80 members in the 699-member lower house of parliament, the Bundestag, according to projections by the political research institute Infratest Dimap. \"It would poison the climate in the German Bundestag,\" said Meister. \"It would have a huge impact on the quality of the discussions in the German public, in German political circles, in the Bundestag. They would be much more polarized: much more homophobic, much more anti-migrant, much more-anti-Muslim.\" Putin's long game Any story about the Kremlin's international strategy needs at least one key disclaimer: Beyond supporting specific politicians, Russian President Vladimir Putin simply hopes to break democracies into shambles \u2014 especially in Europe. \"[Russia] may not be aimed at strengthening one party or another, or ensuring that one or another person is elected to run the government \u2014 but that the trust in the functioning of our democracy is damaged,\" said Hans-Georg Maassen, the head of Germany's domestic intelligence agency. He spoke at an ominous press conference in July warning about impending Russian efforts. Some experts point to Russia and Germany's economic ties as a reason Putin's government is playing a smaller role than it has in other countries' recent elections. Others note that Germany still uses a paper-and-pen voting system that makes the country less vulnerable to digital compromise. But it's also important to remember the all-out blitz America saw in 2016, actually began years before. So the big digital push could still be coming ahead of voting on Sunday, says Measuring Fake News' S\u00e4ngerlaub. \"America is always a little bit faster than Europe ... So maybe what we're seeing right now, is what was happening four years ago in the American election campaign,\" he said. \"It could be that in four years, when more people are using social media as their most important source of information, then we could deal maybe with the same problems.\" Merkel isn't expected to seek a fifth term in 2021, and as long as Putin feels vulnerable, European countries should expect the Russian government to look for ways to poke and prod weak spots in their electorates, says Jakub Janda, the head of the Prague-based Kremlin Watch Program at the pro-democracy European Values think tank. Putin worries that strong democracies near the Russian border could lead to Russians questioning their own authoritarian regime, Janda says. So the Russian leader doesn't want democratic countries to be successful models. He wants them to be in chaos. \"Russia is very weak on so many levels: The only issues it is a superpower in is nuclear weapons, abortions, or doping,\" Janda said. \"So if you are playing soccer, and you cannot defeat the other team because they are so much stronger, you can tear down the field so that it's hard to play.\" Reporter Simon Sch\u00fctz, an Arthur F.

A neat row of potted plants, all in bloom, greets visitors at the entrance of the Jassem family home in Lebanon's Bekaa Valley. Inside, decorative tassels dangle from the ceiling, with a golden-colored cloth on display. Children play around foam mattresses resting on a clean-swept concrete floor. It has the feel of a family home, but the Jassems are living in a plastic tent. They are refugees from Syria, which they fled five years ago, for a patch of ground in rural Lebanon. Doha Jassem, who shares the shelter with her brother and his family, says they left their homes in Idlib, a northern province of Syria after the war came to their village. Bombings were happening around them and they were afraid for their children. They have tried to start their lives over, but Lebanon doesn't allow formal refugee camps. So the family have scrimped together what money they can to rent land and build a shelter. But, she says, they have been forced to move four times. On one occasion the Lebanese army told them they didn't have the right land permit, and ripped down their tent. That general feeling of insecurity has morphed into a real fear for their safety. Jassem plays a recording on her phone, and the children in the shelter crowd in to listen. In the recording, a male voice calls for violence against Syrians on a specific date. \"In every area. In the street you're on, in your building. Gather; gather amongst yourselves,\" the voice says, his tone deliberate and cold. \"Anyone who sees a Syrian, hit him. Hit him. Break him.\" Even though Jassem doesn't know who was behind it, she believed the threats. She says it caused panic among the refugees in the informal settlement where they live. \"Syrians started sending this to each other to make sure no Syrian went out that day,\" she says. \"None of us even tried to step outside.\" Her daughter's eyes well with tears. A young boy, no older than 3 years of age, picks up on the change in mood in the tent and starts to sob. After fleeing from the war in Syria, the Jassem family sought refuge in Lebanon, where they've made a home inside a plastic tent.\n                \n                    \n                    Ruth Sherlock for NPR\n                    \n                \nhide caption After fleeing from the war in Syria, the Jassem family sought refuge in Lebanon, where they've made a home inside a plastic tent. Across the country, refugees have reported feeling increasingly unsafe. And while attacks against them are mostly isolated incidents, aid agencies say they are increasingly concerned by a noted, hostile shift in public opinion. Feelings of resentment have hardened with politicians \u2014 who have an election coming up next year \u2014 playing to their electorates by calling on refugees to leave. In a recent press conference, Samir Geagea, the leader of the Lebanese Forces, a Christian political party, suggested asking Syrians not wanted by the Assad regime to return to parts of the country that Damascus controls. It would allow Lebanon to \"get rid\" of hundreds of thousands of refugees, he said. Most of the main political groups have spoken out against the presence of Syrians in Lebanon. Nabil Kaouk, the deputy leader of Hezbollah's Executive Council, has said, \"The refugee crisis is choking Lebanon.\" The war in neighboring Syria has sparked an influx of refugees into Lebanon equal to around one quarter of the country's population. The United Nations has registered more than 1 million Syrian refugees, though the actual numbers are known to be much higher. In some towns in Lebanon, there are now more Syrians than Lebanese. When Syrians first began to flee the war in 2011, many Lebanese opened their homes to them. \"There was a warm connection between Lebanese and Syrian people,\" says Maria Assi, the CEO of Beyond Association, a group that helps Syrians in Lebanon. \"Until now, all the people around the world say the Lebanese people don't treat the Syrian people well. When we are the only country in the world that received such a big number of refugees.\" Assi says the generosity of the Lebanese towards the refugee population is something that continues to this day. She blames the rise in hostility on a failure of the government and international aid agencies to put in place a long-term strategy to help the country adapt to the increase in population. She says the enormous strain on the country's already weak infrastructure is something that can no longer be ignored. \"Even the health clinics or in the schools, now it's more difficult,\" she says. \"Now there is even pollution in the rivers because the wastewater from Syria has gone into them.\" With no end in sight for the Syrian war, Lebanese are facing the prospect that the influx might be permanent. \"It is not easy for Lebanese community to think Syrian refugees will stay,\" Assi says. \"No country accept. And no people around the world can accept.\" The United Nations has registered more than 1 million Syrian refugees in Lebanon, but there actual numbers are known to be much higher.\n                \n                    \n                    Ruth Sherlock for NPR\n                    \n                \nhide caption The United Nations has registered more than 1 million Syrian refugees in Lebanon, but there actual numbers are known to be much higher. Tensions worsened this summer as the Lebanese government launched an offensive to push Syrian rebel groups away from the country's border. But the government detained some 400 refugees living in a settlement near the town of Arsal in the process. Four men died in custody. A video also began circulating widely of Lebanese men beating up a refugee on the street. They were arrested by the authorities. The hostility has become so intense that hundreds of Lebanese writers, poets and scholars have signed a petition of protest. \"We started off as a reaction to what was happening,\" said Makram Rabah, a political analyst and a history lecturer at the American University of Beirut. Rabah said they wanted to take a \"moral stand\" against the persecution and assault of refugees. But he also warned that the attacks hurt Lebanon's stability. Many Lebanese see echoes in today's crisis of the conditions that bred Lebanon's civil war in 1975. That conflict was in part set off by clashes over tensions following an influx of Palestinian refugees. Rabah is not predicting a return to civil war. But he warns that \"instigating hatred\" pushes people to extremes, and could drive some desperate refugees into the arms of extremist groups. In the Bekaa Valley, Jassem says her family has been directly attacked. One recent day as she went with her husband and son to buy vegetables, she says a man ran at them. \"We were riding my husband's motorcycle and we had my son,\" she says, and \"this man launched himself at the front of the motorcycle with a sickle.\" She says he swung at them and the blade hit the motorbike. Then they drove away as fast as they could. \"We were so afraid.\" It's not just street vigilantes the family is afraid of. One day, Jassem says, soldiers raided their tent. They had come to check permits, and only the women were home. She said the soldiers made them and their children wait for hours in the hot sun. Jassem believes the harassment was intended as warning: We'll host you while your country is at war. But don't think for a second that you're welcome to stay.",

If you picked up a print copy of The New York Times on Friday, you may have noticed something unusual about it \u2014 something missing. There were no front-page headlines about President Trump, no pictures of him \u2014 not even a little \"key\" to a story on an inside page. The name Trump did appear in one story, a profile of John W. Nicholson Jr., the Army general commanding U.S. forces in Afghanistan. The president was necessarily mentioned in that story, but the story was not about the president. So while not everyone will notice how little Trump there was on the page, rest assured there were those who did. (Likely one in particular.) The president makes no secret of his obsessive interest in certain media, especially TV and the publications based in New York. He reads the Times as though he worked there. He is known to keep an extensive collection of magazine covers featuring his face. Of course, it's possible the president overlooked his sudden absence from the Times' front, with its unique power to set agendas elsewhere in journalism. But we still assume others in the White House had to worry about the president's reaction. In Trump World, being in headlines and on front pages \u2014 being featured \u2014 is how you happen. Otherwise, you may not exist. The president rose to prominence largely on the strength of world-class self-promotion. His hotels and other properties are known for the prominence and sheer size of the letters announcing his name. This is more than a metaphor for self-involvement. Being famous for being famous has been crucial to his brand, even synonymous with it. In estimating his own net worth, Trump has in the past said the ability to lease his name alone should be valued in 10 figures. He made a fortune in reality TV by exploiting an image and persona created in the tabloids and on shock-jock radio. He prospered in defiance of conventional norms. When he turned to politics, he brought his fanatical focus on downmarket branding. The issues he could make his own included the debunked \"birther\" conspiracy about the citizenship of Barack Obama, a ban on Muslim immigrants and refugees, and empathy for anti-vaccine activists. And, of course, above all, the wall. And making Mexico pay for it. These were the issues that helped catapult Trump in 2016 over 16 rivals with better credentials as Republicans. So no wonder he believes the letters of his own name make a better brand than G-O-P. We recall the Trump presidential candidacy in part as a parade of products bearing his name. He announced his candidacy from Trump Tower, treated his Washington hotel as a waiting room for the White House, peddled his steaks and bottled water, and promoted his for-profit \"university\" (even in bankruptcy). In much the same way, he had his branded issues that mattered to him and his voters. And that helped him overwhelm 16 intraparty rivals with media presence and his performance in televised debates. The \"Never Trump\" movement never got off the ground. Nearly every Republican who mattered agreed to bend the knee. They wanted the White House, they wanted to beat Hillary Clinton. They needed to maintain turnout among conservatives as well as rank-and-file Republicans in order to hold the House and Senate and a raft of state-level offices as well. All that is true. But it is also true that Republicans expected to get something in return \u2014 something beyond victory parties on election night. They expected Trump to meet them in the middle, or at least move in their direction. Instead, Trump has shown an undiminished determination to go his own way, to be his own man with his own brand and his own issue priorities. He followed his own compass in responding to the violence in Charlottesville, Va. He went to Arizona and scorched both of its Republican senators. He took to Twitter to bushwhack his own party's leaders in the House and Senate on the eve of a difficult month of fiscal negotiations to keep the federal government operating. (\"It should have been easy,\" said the president, \"now a mess!\") Trump has now decided his own bottom line for September is not so much a functioning government or a responsible Republican majority as it is a win for his border wall. No promise that he made to his primary voters, his November voters or the people who crowd into his rallies even now mattered more then or matters more now than the imagined wall from the Pacific to the Gulf of Mexico. It is the solid realization of the dream of \"America First.\" \"If we have to shut this government down, we are going to build that wall,\" Trump told his ecstatic crowd in Phoenix. Of course, House Speaker Paul Ryan and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell have shown no interest in the wall. Rather, both care about the nation's fiscal housekeeping \u2014 the budget, the debt ceiling, the annual spending process. Ryan and McConnell's brand is governing. Trump's brand is still Trump. In the struggles of September, we shall see which brand the Republican Congress will wear.",

            "article_content": "President Trump, flanked by Sens. Tom Cotton, R-Ark. (left), and David Perdue, R-Ga., speaks in the Roosevelt Room of the White House on Wednesday during the unveiling of legislation that would place new limits on legal immigration.\n                \n                    \n                    Evan Vucci/AP\n                    \n                \nhide caption No single issue has been a greater animating force for the Republican base over the past decade than immigration \u2014 except maybe the Affordable Care Act (aka Obamacare). And with the failure of GOP health care efforts in Congress and sliding poll numbers this summer, the Trump White House seems to be making a concerted effort to elevate cultural wedge issues, from immigration and a ban on transgender people in the military to affirmative action and police conduct. \"Trump has been under siege since he took office,\" said Brian Jones, a Republican political consultant and veteran of several presidential campaigns, \"and the cumulative effect of his administration's missteps is an eroding approval rating, even among Republicans.\" So Trump's team is rolling the dice, betting that if he can't get something done through the usual avenues in Washington, he can at least keep his supporters outside of it fired up with a dose of the cultural grievances that helped get him elected. When a president's back is up against the wall, what he has got left is his base. He can't afford to lose his most ardent supporters, so, often, presidents go back to the embers they stoked to fire up those supporters in the first place \u2014 be they cultural or economic. On Wednesday, the Trump White House backed a hard-line immigration proposal that would significantly curtail legal immigration. The move came less than a week after the Senate health care bill went up in smoke \u2014 and on the heels of some other culture war moves from the president. Trump tweeted a call for a ban on transgender people in the military; the Justice Department put up a personnel posting to staff an effort to sue over racial discrimination against Asian-Americans in university admissions; and Trump suggested in a speech to police that they shouldn't be \"too nice\" to certain suspects. That is all red meat for his base \u2014 issues that have historically played to white grievance. Out of the hot focus of the legislative and Russia investigation headlines, many of these issues have been there since the start of the Trump presidency. One of his first major efforts was the travel ban that targets people from six (originally seven) majority-Muslim countries. And the Justice Department is working to try to cut off funding to so-called sanctuary cities, as well as urging prosecutors to seek the toughest sentences possible for nonviolent drug offenders, reversing Obama-era policy. \"I assume they're doing it because these are policies that the president believes will 'make America great again,' \" said Alex Conant, a former Republican National Committee spokesman and veteran political operative who worked for Sen. Marco Rubio's presidential campaign, in a reference to Trump's campaign slogan. \"Politically, it could help him maintain a floor as his poll numbers continue to slide.\" Trump received the worst numbers of his presidency this week. A Quinnipiac poll had the president at just a 33 percent approval rating with Republican support slipping. \"Speak English\" \"Speak English,\" the president and Sen. Tom Cotton, R-Ark., one of the sponsors of the immigration legislation, said was one of their requirements for those who want to come to the United States. They also said these new \u2014 legal \u2014 immigrants will have to have skills that could help the economy and have to be able to financially support themselves. When confronted with the poem at the Statue of Liberty about welcoming the tired, huddled masses, White House policy adviser Stephen Miller told reporters, \"The poem that you're referring to \u2014 that was added later \u2014 is not actually a part of the original Statue of Liberty.\" The poem that you're referring to \u2014 that was added later \u2014 is not actually a part of the original Statue of Liberty.\" Stephen Miller, White House policy adviser, on the Emma Lazarus poem at the Statue of Liberty that talks about \"huddled masses\" The poem \u2014 The New Colossus by Emma Lazarus \u2014 was added in 1903, 17 years after Lady Liberty was dedicated. It was written by Lazarus 20 years earlier as part of a fundraiser for the statue. Lazarus was the daughter of a wealthy sugar-refining family but was taken with the plight of the immigrants and refugees with whom she worked. Her poem depicts the Statue of Liberty as the \"Mother of Exiles.\" Lazarus' story and poem are featured by the National Park Service on its Statue of Liberty website. The American immigration story for many, if not most, is one of people coming to the U.S. with little more than the clothes on their backs \"yearning to breathe free.\" Many are escaping poverty or war or simply seeking a better life, a chance to live a middle-class existence for themselves and their children. It's the quintessential American Dream, that anyone can make it in the U.S. The Trump administration argues that it is backing the legislation because it would be good for American jobs, especially for minorities already in the country, who cannot find work. \"Among those hit the hardest in recent years have been immigrants and, very importantly, minority workers competing for jobs against brand-new arrivals,\" Trump said Wednesday in announcing his support for the bill. \"And it has not been fair to our people, to our citizens, to our workers.\" That sentiment is real. Anecdotally, low-skilled laborers have traditionally been prone to skepticism toward new immigrants, who can be paid less. Businesses argue that Americans won't take the more dangerous, laborious work. NPR's Amita Kelly fact-checked the claim on Friday, finding mixed conclusions: \"Economists disagree whether or how much an influx of immigrants depresses wages. Some have found that new immigrants depress wages for certain groups, such as teenagers or workers with a high school diploma or less. Others say the overall effect on the economy is tiny, and an influx of immigrant workers vitalizes the economy overall.\" (Kelly also dove into the specific research cited by Miller, who has been pushing this issue for years going back to when he was an aide to then-Sen. Jeff Sessions, the current attorney general.) It has been a similar story for years. The Washington Post took a deep look at this in 2013 and wrote: \"According to some experts, the flood of Hispanic immigrant workers in the past 25 years \u2014 both legal and illegal \u2014 has had a much smaller effect on employment patterns than other trends, including factory flight overseas, weakened labor unions and a spate of recessions. \"They also say that low-skilled immigration has been both a boon and a burden to America. It has squeezed public services but generated tax revenue. It has depressed wages in some areas but has revitalized ailing communities. The group that suffers most from the influx of new foreign laborers, these experts report, are earlier immigrants.\" Proving divisive It's not just the immigration push that is proving divisive. So are the other recent controversial, culturally focused steps taken by the administration. The Justice Department says its affirmative-action effort is about \"racial discrimination against Asian-Americans,\" according to a spokeswoman, who added that the department \"is committed to protecting all Americans from all forms of illegal race-based discrimination.\" \"Maybe now people will finally pay attention to something we Asian-Americans have been talking about for so long,\" Joe Zhou told the Los Angeles Times. Zhou sued Harvard in 2015 on behalf of his son, who did not get in despite being a valedictorian with a 4.44 grade-point average, near-perfect SATs and involvement in extracurricular activities. But not all Asian-Americans feel that way. The advocacy group Asian Americans Advancing Justice condemned the Trump administration's move and said it supports affirmative-action policies. \"Affirmative action expands educational opportunities for all applicants in a society where cultural and racial biases in testing and access to quality education deny many students equal opportunity,\" the group wrote in a statement. Instead of attacking affirmative action programs, the Trump administration should use its platform to increase opportunities for all students.\" Asian Americans Advancing Justice It noted that affirmative-action policies particularly help \"low-income and working-class Asian-Americans and Pacific Islanders.\" Civil rights groups say affirmative-action opponents often focus on Asian-Americans for these kinds of cases as part of an effort to weaken affirmative-action policies more broadly. \"Since the new administration has been in office, it has been moving very deliberately to operationalize its nativist agenda with policies like this one,\" Advancing Justice continued. \"Instead of attacking affirmative action programs, the Trump administration should use its platform to increase opportunities for all students while continuing to address the persistent equity gaps for low-income students and students of color. We support affirmative action and refuse to allow Asian Americans to be used as a wedge between communities of color.\" Cornell William Brooks, the former head of the NAACP, said on CNN Wednesday that the Justice Department was looking for \"ideological victims\" and \"racial bogeymen\" that don't exist. That is part of why Trump's efforts convince racial and ethnic minorities that legal immigration hurts them doesn't appear to have made a dent. These things are always a matter of priorities. Trump's attempts to win over minority communities have often fallen short. \"What the hell do you have to lose?\" he asked in comments aimed at black voters \u2014 at a campaign rally delivered to a largely white crowd in Michigan. Trump wound up winning just 8 percent of black voters in 2016, less than George W. Bush in 2000 and 2004 and barely more than Mitt Romney in 2012. In reality, those appeals were also largely aimed at trying to keep the GOP voting bloc together, part of an effort to make Trump appear open-minded to white, suburban Republicans. The impending ban on transgender people serving in the military, which Trump announced via Twitter, caught Pentagon leaders off guard. Some seemed none-too-pleased with it \u2014 and appear to be breaking ranks with their commander in chief. Coast Guard Commandant Adm. Paul Zukunft told a transgender service member, for example, that he \"will not break faith.\" Joint Chiefs of Staff Chairman Joseph Dunford issued a statement saying, \"There will be no modifications to the current policy until the President's direction has been received by the secretary of defense and the secretary has issued implementation guidance.\" Trying to stop the slide The immigration legislation has little chance of passing in Congress. It doesn't have the support of 50 Republican senators, let alone the 60 total votes in the Senate needed to overcome a filibuster. So why push this? Narratives of health care failure and Russia investigations have dominated headlines and cable news over the past couple of months. And Trump's numbers have suffered because of it. That Quinnipiac poll is hardly the only one to show this. Every poll has shown a clear trend. Even Rasmussen, a polling outfit the statistical community frowns upon but that the president pays attention to, had Trump at 38 percent Wednesday. Drudge highlighted the poll on its site \u2014 in bolded and in red font \u2014 this way: \"RASMUSSEN: TRUMP APPROVAL DOWN TO 38%...  \"Lower than Obama received during his entire presidency...\" These are historically bad numbers for a president. No one has been this low at the same time since polling began. But, in fairness, Trump also had historically bad numbers for any major-party nominee \u2014 and still won the presidency. That is important to remember, but it certainly didn't matter in the election and it's not everything now. The actions the White House is taking and the issues the administration is pushing signal worries among the president's political team. \"Looking at this through a political lens,\" Jones said. \"It appears these coordinated announcements are an effort to keep his core supporters engaged and on board the Trump train.\" There are signs of bumpiness on the tracks. Trump won independents in 2016, but a late June NPR/PBS NewsHour/Marist poll found his net approval among them had fallen 17 points since February. His base, however, appeared intact. That may be changing. Traditionally, even in the worst of times, presidents retain very high support among their party. But Quinnipiac found a softening, a 10-point drop since June among Republicans saying they \"very strongly\" approve of the president. Barely a majority of Republicans said they \"strongly approved,\" 53 percent, down from 63 percent two months ago. \"The trend is worrisome,\" Conant said. Insider looking out? Trump has begun distancing himself from congressional Republicans, referring to them as \"they\" and publicly shaming them for having promised action on health care for seven years. But there is only so long a president can position himself as the \"outsider.\" President Obama certainly tried. He ran a re-election campaign partially on it. Trump is at least now partly responsible for the legislative push \u2014 and for making the argument for policies. That is something he has failed to do effectively. On health care, for example, he never got beyond boilerplate political talking points to engage the public with any depth on the nuts and bolts of policy. Yes, health care is complicated. Obama was steeped in policy, and on many issues, especially health care, he was his administration's best spokesman. But when there were failures, just like Trump, Obama blamed \"Congress,\" all of Congress. That infuriated his own party. \"The most important lesson I've learned, is that you can't change Washington from the inside,\" Obama said in September 2012, two months before winning re-election. \"You can only change it from the outside.\" For Trump, the blameless posture is complicated by the deal-maker persona he has created for himself. He wrote a book about it. Trump has pledged to make the \"best\" deals. So far, though, he has dealt only with Republicans, making no serious push to bring Democrats on board. At this point, he is only at the threatening stage with Democrats. Maybe that shouldn't be surprising, however, considering how Trump advocates making deals in The Art of the Deal. In one section, he imagines how he would have responded to a hostile takeover attempt that played out in a different company. \"I'm not saying I would also have won, but if I went down, it would have been kicking and screaming,\" he wrote. \"I would have closed the hotel and let it rot. That's just my makeup. I fight when I feel I'm getting screwed, even if it's costly and difficult and highly risky.\" That could explain tweets like this, sent in the wee hours of July 28, the morning after the Senate's Obamacare repeal effort failed: \"As I said from the beginning, let ObamaCare implode, then deal. Watch!\" \"Time to force the conversation\" The White House seems to see this culture push as good politics. In the briefing room with reporters, Miller, for example, called the immigration legislation \"enormously advantageous\" and said it was \"time to force the conversation on this issue.\" He even explicitly mentioned \"battleground states.\" \"Public support is so immense on this,\" Miller contended. \"If you just look at the polling data in many key battleground states across the country \u2014 that over time you're going to see massive public push for this kind of legislation.\" That doesn't terribly sound unlike the unnamed White House aide who told Axios this about the president's announcement of a ban on transgender people in the military: \"This forces Democrats in Rust Belt states like Ohio, Michigan, and Wisconsin, to take complete ownership of this issue. How will the blue-collar voters in these states respond when senators up for re-election in 2018 like Debbie Stabenow are forced to make their opposition to this a key plank of their campaigns?\" Some Republicans worry reviving the culture wars is the wrong place to focus to achieve the outcome this White House is looking for. But, White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders disputed there were any electoral calculations behind the ban. Asked on July 26 whether the decision had anything to do with trying to put pressure on Democrats in battleground seats, she said, \"Not that I'm aware.\" She said it was all about \"military readiness and unit cohesion.\" A different official also told The Washington Post that the decision was about \"military readiness and military resource decision,\" but added, \"It will be fun to watch some of them [Democrats] have to defend this, but that was never an impetus.\" Some Republicans worry reviving the culture wars is the wrong place to focus to achieve the outcome this White House is looking for. \"The challenge is for every political action, there is an equal and opposite reaction,\" Jones said, \"and I think many Main Street Republicans, let alone independents, will bristle at proposals they consider to be exceptionally exclusionary particularly in the absence of addressing issues that traditionally animate the whole party, like tax reform.\"",

Christians who have come to the United States seeking refuge from persecution should be a natural constituency for Donald Trump. During his campaign and in his early weeks in office, Trump highlighted the plight of Christians around the world who suffer for their beliefs. \"Christians in the Middle East have been executed in large numbers,\" he tweeted in January. \"We cannot allow this horror to continue!\" The first version of Trump's travel ban gave preferential treatment to Christian refugees, and when Vice President Mike Pence spoke at the World Summit in Defense of Persecuted Christians in May, he quoted Trump as saying, \"Nobody has been treated worse in the Middle East.\" Trump had made clear, Pence said, that \"America will stand by followers of Christ.\" Vice President Mike Pence addresses the World Summit in Defense of Persecuted Christians earlier this year.\n                \n                    \n                    Cliff Owen/AP\n                    \n                \nhide caption Vice President Mike Pence addresses the World Summit in Defense of Persecuted Christians earlier this year. The defense of beleaguered Christians, however, is now clashing with another Trump priority. As a candidate and as president, Trump has called for the strict enforcement of immigration laws and the removal of people who are residing in the United States illegally. Many of the Middle East Christians who came to the United States in recent decades have overstayed their visas, failed to apply for asylum on time, or committed some crime. As a result, they are now subject to being sent back to the countries from which they fled. The Trump administration is therefore facing a choice: whether to follow through on the pledge to protect Christians facing persecution or to proceed with stepped up deportation efforts, even if it means sending some Christians back to countries where they are certain to be mistreated. The dilemma is clearest in the case of Iraqi Christians, a community the Obama Administration officially recognized as threatened by genocide. Most are Chaldean Catholics; of more than 340 Chaldean churches in Iraq in 2003, fewer than 40 remain in operation today, according to the Chaldean Community Foundation. During those years, thousands of Christians have been killed in Iraq, and thousands more have fled, many of them to the United States. Some of them broke the rules and did not go through the process they should have, but these were people fearing for their lives and fleeing countries that were extremely hostile to whom and what they worship. Phillipe Nassif A significant portion of those Iraqi Christians, however, are now in imminent danger of being deported as a result of the Trump Administration's new get-tough policies. Five days after taking office, President Trump signed an executive order calling for \"the removal of aliens who have no right to be in the United States\" and directing government agencies \"to employ all lawful means\" in pursuit of that goal. Among those affected were the Chaldean Christians, more than a thousand of whom have been arrested in recent weeks by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents and prepared for deportation. Many had lived in the United States for years, and some had committed crimes that exposed them to deportation, but no enforcement action had previously been taken against them. If deported to Iraq, the Chaldeans will return to a profoundly hostile environment, and their threatened removal has been criticized by U.S. Christian leaders, including Franklin Graham, the son of evangelist Billy Graham and a strong Trump supporter during the 2016 election. \"I find it very disturbing what I have read about Chaldean Christians being rounded up by U.S. ICE for possible deportation,\" Graham wrote in a Facebook post. \"I would encourage our president to give great consideration to the threat to lives of Christians in countries like Iraq.\" Graham's statement followed an appeal from a coalition of evangelical leaders, urging the Department of Homeland Security to hold off on the deportation of the Iraqi Christians, and the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops made a similar plea. The Trump administration, however, appears unmoved by the protests. \"If we find someone here illegally, we're not going to turn the other way,\" ICE Director Thomas Homan told reporters last week at a White House briefing. \"Those who entered our country illegally violated our country's laws.\" He did not appear open to giving preferential treatment to one group. \"The moment law enforcement starts carving out exemptions is the moment the rule of law starts to erode,\" he said. The Chaldeans from Iraq are not the only immigrant Christian group who may have to return to the very countries they fled. Dozens of Christians from Indonesia, most of them ethnic Chinese, also face deportation. Indonesia is 90 percent Muslim, and Islamist extremism is on the rise there. \"Ethnic Chinese Christians being sent back to Indonesia at this particular moment is a very frightening thing,\" says Rev. Seth Kaper-Dale, pastor of the Reformed Church in Highland Park, New Jersey, where he ministers to a number of Indonesian Christians. Most of them came to the United States in the late 1990s and early 2000s, when Christians in Indonesia faced intense hostility. Many came on tourist visas and neglected to apply for asylum or missed the deadline, but stayed in the United States anyway after their visas expired, for fear of what they would encounter back in Indonesia. Lacking authorization to stay in the United States, they eventually became subject to deportation. In May, four Indonesian men Kaper-Dale had been counseling were arrested and deported. With Kaper-Dale's encouragement, they had been reporting regularly to immigration offices for years without incident. \"People who were not prioritized [for removal] before are now being prioritized,\" Kaper Dale says, \"and there's a lot more people out there to hunt them down.\" Trump's January 25 executive order called for the hiring of 10,000 new immigration officers. Ethnic and religious tensions, meanwhile, are rising again in Indonesia. In May, the governor of Jakarta, a Christian, was convicted of blasphemy for suggesting that the Quran did not prohibit Muslims from supporting non-Muslim candidates. \"You're sending [Christians] back to Jakarta airport at a time when emotions are high, when there's tension between the Christian community and the Muslim community,\" Kaper-Dale says. \"We're talking about sending people back who escaped a blood bath directed against their own people.\" With the Trump administration showing no sign of relenting on its deportation policy, groups who advocate for Christians worldwide are growing increasingly alarmed. \"I can run through a list of countries where there are religious minorities who came to the United States to be safe,\" says Philippe Nassif, executive director of the nonprofit group In Defense of Christians. \"The same goes Christians from Sudan,\" Nassif says. \"The same goes, potentially, for Coptic Christians, for the Indonesian Christians. Some of them broke the rules and did not go through the process they should have, but these were people fearing for their lives and fleeing countries that were extremely hostile to whom and what they worship.\"",

The Supreme Court says it will decide the fate of President Trump's revised travel ban, agreeing to hear arguments over immigration cases that were filed in federal courts in Hawaii and Maryland and allowing parts of the ban that has been on hold since March to take effect. The justices removed the two lower courts' injunctions against the ban \"with respect to foreign nationals who lack any bona fide relationship with a person or entity in the United States,\" narrowing the scope of those injunctions that had put the ban in limbo. Trump called the Supreme Court's order \"a clear victory for our national security.\" The president's revised executive order blocks new visas for travelers from six majority-Muslim countries for 90 days, and suspends the U.S. refugee program for 120 days. Challengers to the ban said it would harm people who have legitimate reasons to be in the U.S. \u2014 including through family ties, work and education. The travel ban will remain on hold for plaintiffs who challenged the executive order and for anyone who is \"similarly situated,\" the justices say \u2014 in other words, foreign nationals who have relatives in the U.S., or who plan to attend school or work here. Refugees will face similar criteria, with anyone lacking connections in the U.S. denied entry. In its order, the court stated, \"the balance tips in favor of the Government's compelling need to provide for the Nation's security.\" Saying the petitions and injunctions \"are accordingly ripe for consideration,\" the Supreme Court said on Monday that the two cases will be consolidated. The court's clerk will set a date for the case in the session that begins in October, the justices said, while noting that the Trump administration \"has not requested that we expedite consideration of the merits to a greater extent.\" U.S. Attorney General Jeff Sessions said today's move is \"an important step towards restoring the separation of powers between the branches of the federal government.\" Omar Jadwat, director of the ACLU's Immigrants' Rights Project, called the travel ban unconstitutional, saying, \"Courts have repeatedly blocked this indefensible and discriminatory ban. The Supreme Court now has a chance to permanently strike it down.\" In a statement released by the White House, Trump wrote: \"As President, I cannot allow people into our country who want to do us harm. I want people who can love the United States and all of its citizens, and who will be hardworking and productive. \"My number one responsibility as Commander in Chief is to keep the American people safe. Today's ruling allows me to use an important tool for protecting our Nation's homeland. I am also particularly gratified that the Supreme Court's decision was 9-0.\" The court says its nine justices agreed in the 13-page decision to take the case and place stays on some of the preliminary injunctions. But several justices wanted to go further \u2014 Justice Clarence Thomas wrote a three-page opinion, joined by Justices Samuel Alito and Neil Gorsuch, in which he said the government's request for a stay should have been granted in full. \"I agree with the Court's implicit conclusion that the Government has made a strong showing that it is likely to succeed on the merits,\" Thomas wrote, \"that is, that the judgments below will be reversed.\" Thomas criticized the decision to keep the injunctions in place for what he called \"an unidentified, unnamed group of foreign nationals abroad,\" saying it places a burden on officials to determine who has a \"bona fide relationship\" with a person or organization in the U.S. Trump's revised executive order was put on hold by lower court judges in Hawaii and Maryland in March, hours before it was set to take effect. Two federal appeals courts left those nationwide injunctions in place, setting up one final appeal for the Trump administration. The White House argues that this executive order, like the previous version the president signed in January, is necessary to protect national security. The initial version caused chaos at airports across the country until it was blocked by a federal judge in Washington state, prompting the administration to craft a revised version that omitted references to religion and specifically exempted green card holders. But that order, too, was challenged by lawsuits, and it was blocked by lower courts before it ever went into effect. As part of its instructions to the parties in the case, the high court said today that they should answer the question of \"whether the challenges ... became moot on June 14, 2017\" \u2014 referring to the order's timeframe of 90 days. Both of the federal appeals courts that have considered the revised executive order have ruled against the administration \u2014 but for different reasons. The appellate judges weren't directly ruling on the merits of the travel ban itself. But in order to decide if the lower court injunctions were appropriate, they had to weigh the probable impact of the order and the likelihood that the legal challenges would succeed. The 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals looked extensively at whether the travel ban violated the Constitution by discriminating on the basis of religion. The challengers in that case, led by the nonprofit International Refugee Assistance Project, argued that the travel ban is a thinly veiled attempt to block Muslims from entering the country, something Trump and his advisers talked about during and after the presidential campaign. Lawyers for the Department of Justice countered that courts should look only at the language of the executive order itself, which does not mention religion explicitly. But that argument did not prevail. Writing for the 10-3 majority, Chief Judge Roger Gregory said the executive order \"speaks with vague words of national security but in context drips with religious intolerance.\" The ruling from the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals focused on federal law. The court found that the president likely exceeded his statutory authority under the Immigration and Nationality Act. \"The order does not offer a sufficient justification to suspend the entry of more than 180 million people on the basis of nationality,\" the 9th Circuit judges wrote. \"National security is not a 'talismanic incantation' that, once invoked, can support any and all exercise of executive power.\" The Trump administration moved quickly to appeal both rulings to the Supreme Court.   \"The Executive Branch is entrusted with the responsibility to keep the country safe under Article II of the Constitution,\" Sessions said in a statement after the 9th Circuit ruling. The attorney general called the threat of terrorism \"immediate and real,\" and said the lower court's injunction \"has a chilling effect on security operations overall.\"",

Immigration authorities have rounded up nearly 200 Iraqis in recent weeks, and the Trump administration is now under heavy pressure to hold off moves to deport them. Many of those currently detained are from the minority Chaldean Christian community, which faces severe persecution in Iraq. U.S. immigration authorities say the detained Iraqis have criminal records, but their families and supporters say many have already served time or paid their fines and that they would face persecution if sent back. A lawsuit on behalf of the Chaldean Christians was heard in court Wednesday in Detroit. The American Civil Liberties Union is seeking a temporary stay of the deportations. Protesters outside the Detroit courtroom Wednesday shouted in support of the detained Iraqis, Michigan Radio reports. Some held signs depicting President Trump that read \"You Vowed To Protect Us.\" On the campaign trail and in office, Trump has vowed to help persecuted Christians in the Middle East. The ACLU lawsuit includes the stories of seven lead plaintiffs, including several who came from Iraq as refugees and have been in the U.S. for 20 years or more. Russell Moore of the Southern Baptist Convention says many evangelical Christians and Catholics are \"deeply concerned about the possible return of Chaldean Christians to the Middle East, knowing this would essentially be a death sentence.\" Moore is one of many Christian leaders pleading with the Trump Administration not to deport the Chaldean refugees.

In Los Angeles the Pride Parade morphed into a Resist March to stand against the administration's policies.\n                \n                    \n                    Emma McIntyre/Getty Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption The month of June, which is celebrated as gay pride month, has been particularly fraught for one subset of the LGBT community: Trump supporters. In Los Angeles the Pride Parade morphed into a Resist March to stand against the administration's policies. In more than 50 marches across the states, LGBT people and their allies gathered to stand in solidarity against the Trump administration over the weekend. In Washington, D.C., people gathered in droves. Troy King, a 47-year-old gay man from Atlanta, marched to continue to pressure politicians to stand up for his community's rights. \"I'm not proud; I'm just gay,\" he said. Corey Williams, a lesbian woman from D.C., smiled on the sidelines with her dog, Boogie. She said she was happy to see Pride returning to its roots in protest. But the month of June, which is celebrated as gay pride month, can be fraught for one subset of the LGBT community: Trump supporters. That is particularly true this year, as many marches are billed as \"resistance\" protests against the administration. 'Political' Vs. 'Partisan' Protest Matthew Craffey, a member of the conservative LGBT group Log Cabin Republicans, lives in Los Angeles, where he leads the local chapter. There, the Pride Parade has morphed into a Resist March to stand against the ideologies of a Trump presidency and how some of the members of the LGBT community fear his potential policies impact their lives. \"I'm not discrediting people who have issues with the Trump administration, but my problem is that the Pride parade has always been political, but it's never been partisan,\" he said. \"So it's a missed opportunity for all of us to have a break from the division and the anger.\" Gina Roberts, a transgender woman from Los Angeles who served as a delegate at the 2016 Republican convention, said she was disappointed in the change to the Pride parade. \"There's no way in heck that I would attend LA pride because it's a Resist march,\" said Roberts. \"Instead of celebrating diversity, it's the opposite of what Pride stands for.\" But supporters of the Resist movement, like David Stacy, the government affairs director of the Human Rights Campaign advocacy group, said he was frustrated at the thought that this march shouldn't be partisan. \"Pride has always been a protest movement and a Resist movement and a challenge to the status quo,\" Stacy said. Other LGBT activists on the left, like GLAAD CEO Sarah Kate Ellis, agree. She said the plans for over 50 \"resistance and equality marches ... symbolizes a community that feels under attack. Pride started as a resistance march back in the '70s. We're going back to our legacy: When we're being targeted, when we're being attacked, we're going to go to the streets and speak out.\" So what does that mean for the members of the LGBT community who voted Trump and don't want to resist his administration? 'We Exist' Exit polls from NBC News and elsewhere showed that Trump received 14 percent of the LGBT vote against Hillary Clinton's 78 percent. Compare that with Romney's 22 percent in 2012, McCain's 27 percent in 2008, and George Bush's 23 percent in 2004. According to the Pew Research Center, nearly 9 in 10 LGBT voters rated Trump as \"cold\" on a \"feeling thermometer,\" and 9 percent found him \"warm\" or \"somewhat warm.\" But LGBT supporters of the president find this hard to believe. They cite the difficulty of not only coming out as LGBT but also coming out as a Republican. \"The beauty of a secret ballot is no one is going to know who you vote for except you,\" said Charles Moran, a gay Republican who voted for Trump. He added, \"[LGBT] people are shamed into lying that they didn't vote for Donald Trump [when they did].\" Other Trump-supporting members of the LGBT community have echoed Moran's opinions, including Gays for Trump President Peter Boykin, who suspects that Trump got closer to 25 percent of the LGBT vote. \"We exist. ... We're not some little small minority,\" he said. \"I'm pretty damn sure there are more gays who voted for Trump but won't admit it.\" Some supporters say they feel they're openly shamed for their political opinions \u2014 at times more than they're shamed for their sexual orientation. \"Generally, in 2017, it's a lot easier to be openly gay than to be openly Republican,\" said Vincent Foster, president of the Miami chapter of Log Cabin Republicans. 'LGBTQ Is Not A One-Lane Highway' One theme echoed across Trump-supporting members of the LGBT community who spoke with NPR: They define themselves by other identities and values before their sexual orientation. And they don't think the members of their community on the Democratic side feel the same way. \"First of all, one of the distinctions I make about a lot of Republican LGBT members is that we tend to identify ourselves as Americans ... and then we're patriots. And we happen to have this feature where we're gay,\" Gina Roberts of Los Angeles said. \"That's kind of the biggest difference I can see between the two sides.\" Roberts said LGBT people voted for Trump for the same reason straight people did: He was their favorite candidate, not in spite of his stances of social issues, but because of them. But GLAAD's Ellis doesn't think voters can parse out stances of social issues and separate them from any of the other issues. She said no issues can be isolated from the LGBT community. \"If you care about employment, and you could get fired because you're LGBT, it's an employment issue,\" Ellis said. \"At every intersection being LGBTQ is not a one-lane highway.\" And many conservative members of the LGBT community have similar lines of thoughts. They just don't see it as a black-and-white issue. \"Being a gay Republican, I have to ask, 'How much I am going to have to sacrifice my equality agenda with backing up my candidate?' And the good thing about Trump is that I didn't have to do that,\" Moran said. \"I realized that he was the type of candidate the Republican Party needs, and his record was quite good.\" Moran was referring to Trump's business record with hiring members of the LGBT community when he first bought Mar-a-Lago; Trump was believed to be the first club owner in Palm Beach to admit an openly gay couple, as the New York Times has reported. Tracking forward, some LGBT voters, like Vincent Foster, weren't positive if that was enough to sway them to his side \u2014 until the Pulse night club shooting in Orlando one year ago. \"In the aftermath of the Orlando radical terrorist events, his words of acceptance to the LGBT community as a candidate, was when I knew I was going to vote for him,\" Foster said. \"We need better vetting, and we need to increase our FBI abilities and resources. Especially to the LGBT community ... we were specifically targeted. We can't afford to let in everyone. If you want to help a refugee, help LGBT homeless youth.\" The Pulse shooting shook the entire community. And for a few members, it made them wish the U.S. was more aggressive in the war against terrorism. \"The Orlando Pulse night club killing opened a lot of things,\" said George Gramer, Colorado's Log Cabin president. On the anniversary on Monday, Trump tweeted in remembrance of the victims. We will NEVER FORGET the victims who lost their lives one year ago today in the horrific #PulseNightClub shooting. #OrlandoUnitedDay pic.twitter.com/OFFUVAFBJM 'A Disservice To This Movement' Overall, many of these voters say they aren't ignoring their identity in the LGBT community as a trade for conservative values. Rather, they say, they align. \"LGBT people should have a real choice in being able to vote for either party and feel good about it,\" Craffey of Los Angeles said. \"We should each be fighting to make our side better. We're just doing it in different ways and from different perspectives. I think in my opinion, you get a lot more accomplished from engaging than resisting. So I'm going to engage the administration who has been willing to engage with us.\" But Craffey doesn't think the other side of politics necessarily agrees with him. He said he feels ostracized by the rest of the LGBT community, and that makes it more difficult to work together on the policies they do agree on. \"I knew I was a Republican before I knew I was gay,\" Craffey said. But he said he never felt uncomfortable with the Republican Party after coming out as gay. \"If we are a community who celebrates diversity, that has to include political diversity as well. I'm fighting as much for my friends on the left ... as I am for the people in my group and myself.\" Trump-supporting members of the LGBT community said they're trying to be part of both groups, but the partisanship that has taken over politics and the politicization of their identities has made that rather difficult. \"We have values that promote equality,\" Moran said. \"I believe in traditional family values, but that includes my LGBT family. There is no gay perspective on the environment or education. ... Just because I sleep with a man and have a different family doesn't mean I'm any less of a conservative. And now I have to convince the left that I'm gay. For the community on the left to sit there and not treat us equality and not respect our belief is a disservice to this movement.\" What does the community on the left think? \"The president has made a handful of statements saying he's going to be good for LGBT people, but there's been nothing to back that up,\" Stacy of the Human Rights Campaign said. \"I understand people ... saying, 'I'm glad he's not going out and bashing us,' but that's an incredibly low bar to set in 2017. ... If you're continuing to think the president will be good on LGBT rights, you really have your blinders up.\" Christianna Silva is an NPR Digital News intern.",

The race between Democrat Jon Ossoff and Republican Karen Handel is the most expensive U.S. House race in history.  KELLY MCEVERS, HOST: It is the most expensive congressional race in history. The campaign to replace now Health Secretary Tom Price in Georgia's 6th District in the Atlanta suburbs has cost nearly $30 million. The special election will happen two weeks from today. Tonight the candidates debate for the first time. NPR's Brian Naylor reports from Atlanta. BRIAN NAYLOR, BYLINE: It's a rainy morning in Georgia, but undeterred, Democrat Jon Ossoff is pitching in to help deliver some meals on wheels, and 95-year-old Earnest Baker is sitting on the porch to greet him. JON OSSOFF: Hey, Mr. Baker. How are you, sir? EARNEST BAKER: Oh, yeah, I know you. How you doing? NAYLOR: There's a bit of an age difference. Ossoff is a 30-year-old former congressional aide and documentary filmmaker. He came up just short of a majority, 48 percent of the vote in the first round to fill this seat, a surprising showing in a district that has been in Republican hands for decades. Both sides say the enthusiasm can be traced to Democrats' resistance to President Trump. But Ossoff says it's not just Democrats. OSSOFF: There are folks in this community of all political persuasions and backgrounds who have serious concerns about the direction of things in Washington right now, about the direction the administration is taking us in. And I share those concerns. NAYLOR: And Ossoff will likely need some votes from Republicans and independents to win this seat outright. He has raised over $8 million, much of it online from Democrats around the country eager to show their opposition to Trump. That means a lot of TV ads, like this one featuring testimony from women who have survived cancer and are critical of Ossoff's GOP opponent, Karen Handel, who resigned from the Susan G. Komen Foundation amid an uproar after the group ended grants for Planned Parenthood. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN #1: When Karen Handel was an executive at Susan G. Komen, she cut off funding for Planned Parenthood cancer screenings. UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN #2: She jeopardized cancer screening for thousands of women. UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN #1: If Karen Handel... NAYLOR: Handel, who is 55, is a former Georgia secretary of state and Fulton County commissioner. She has worked to tie Ossoff to Democratic leaders like Nancy Pelosi and Bernie Sanders. At last week's state GOP convention, she mocked Ossoff with her take on the Charlie Daniels song \"The Devil Went Down To Georgia.\" (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) KAREN HANDEL: Now, folks, I really don't know if Nancy Pelosi can play the fiddle, but what I do know is she found herself a candidate born out of the left's resistance movement, a candidate that she thinks is her golden fiddle. NAYLOR: Handel did not respond to repeated requests for an interview. She's received support from national GOP groups, including the National Republican Congressional Committee, which is spending some $4 million on ads like this one that attempts to tie Ossoff to terrorism. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) UNIDENTIFIED MAN #1: ISIS is infiltrating America and using Syrians to do it. The FBI warn we can't safely screen every Syrian, yet Jon Ossoff's liberal party bosses brought 10,000 Syrian refugees to America. And Ossoff supports their dangerous Iran nuclear deal, allowing billions for the leading sponsor of terrorism. NAYLOR: Another outside group tried to associate Ossoff with Kathy Griffin. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) UNIDENTIFIED MAN #2: Now a celebrity Jon Ossoff supporter is making jokes about beheading the president of the United States. NAYLOR: Despite the at-times carnival atmosphere of the race GOP operative Lane Flynn, a Handel supporter, says it's good there's enthusiasm on both sides in the election. LANE FLYNN: It's interesting and fascinating to see the level of energy on both sides, quite frankly. So it's not just the money. There's an incredible amount of enthusiasm. Maybe that's just 'cause this is the only race that's going on. NAYLOR: Both candidates hope that tonight's debate will help them win over the few voters who polls say haven't yet made up their minds. Brian Naylor, NPR News, Atlanta.

Her latest battle is a lawsuit against President Trump's travel ban.\n                \n                    \n                    Joel Rose/NPR\n                    \n                \nhide caption Juweiya Ali is fighting to bring her 7-year-old son to the U.S. from Somalia. Her latest battle is a lawsuit against President Trump's travel ban. When President Trump signed an executive order banning travelers from six majority-Muslim countries, a 24-year-old mom from suburban Seattle joined several states and immigrants' rights groups in suing to stop it. Juweiya Ali is fighting to bring her 7-year-old son to the U.S. from Somalia. Ali was born in Somalia but she grew up here, and became a U.S. citizen. In high school, she traveled to Somalia with her mother to reconnect with their culture. That's where she met her future husband, and they had a son. When we sat down at a community center in the Seattle suburbs, Juweiya Ali wore a headscarf and a long, modest dress. She pulled photos of her son out of her purse. He now lives with his grandmother, halfway around the world, in Somalia. \"Isn't he just the cutest thing?,\" Ali cooed. \"He looks a lot like his dad. He is just so sweet.\" Ali eventually returned to the U.S., hoping to bring her family with her. But that's been a long process. She submitted the last piece of paperwork on January 20 \u2014 the same day as President Trump's inauguration. Juweiya Ali with her son, who lives in Somalia, during a recent trip to Ethiopia.\n                \n                    \n                    Courtesy Juweiya Ali\n                    \n                \nhide caption \"So it went from feeling like everything was getting close to being done to, it stopped,\" Ali said. \"Like, what do you mean, it stopped? It was heartbreaking.\" Trump's travel ban order prevented thousands of refugees and visa holders from coming to the U.S. It drew legal challenges across the country, arguing that the ban discriminates against Muslims \u2014 courts have now put it on hold. The Northwest Immigrant Rights Project had many clients affected by the ban, but only a handful joined its lawsuit. \"Many were very reluctant, because they already are so concerned about what's going to happen,\" said Matt Adams, the group's legal director. \"And the idea of taking on the federal government and challenging their actions might seem even more daunting.\" The Project is accustomed to taking on the federal government. It was already in a dispute with the Department of Justice because it gives immigrants free advice but doesn't necessarily represent them in court. But Juweiya Ali didn't hesitate. She's now the lead plaintiff in Ali vs. Trump. \"I just felt like it was unfair,\" Ali said. \"I felt like I'm no different than anyone else here. That I shouldn't have to suffer, that my family shouldn't have to suffer.\" The administration argues that a pause on visas for immigrants from Somalia and five other countries is necessary to protect national security. At a hearing in March, the Justice Department's lawyer, Chad Readler, questioned whether any of the plaintiffs would be harmed. \"The three-month pause is unlikely to have much if any effect on most of the applicants,\" Readler said. \"None of them under the current system are eligible even to come to this country. Most of them have a number of steps in front of them still.\" Ali's son is still waiting for an interview at a U.S. consulate, the last step before he gets a visa. Even though the ban is on hold, the Trump administration is issuing fewer visas. Ali says it's hard to explain all this to her son when they video chat. \"I can hear that in his voice, and I can see that in his eyes, the confusion,\" Ali said. \"But I just tell him, hey, it's gonna be alright. It's going to be fine. And that's all that I can really tell a 7-year-old.\" Driving around her old neighborhood, Ali talks about how Seattle has changed since Trump's election. How she gets dirty looks and comments at the grocery store, which never happened before. Ali said she felt powerless, until she was asked to join the lawsuit. \"That's why it felt like this was a straight yes when I got asked,\" she said. \"Because that was gonna give me some kind of power over the situation, I felt. Like I'm doing something.\" Ali v.Trump is moving forward while appeals courts decide whether to extend lower court orders blocking Trump's travel ban. Whatever happens, Ali says she sleeps better knowing she's doing all she can to bring her son home.",

The camp, one of several set up by migrants and refugees around the French capital, held hundreds of people in degraded conditions for several weeks. French police say they evacuated several makeshift settlements in Paris on Tuesday, evicting refugees and other migrants from the tents they'd been living in for months. The operation, which involved about 350 officers, unfolded without reports of violence or injury. \"The government will take us into houses. I don't know where but it's fine,\" said one erstwhile resident quoted by Al-Jazeera. He told the news agency that many of the people living in the camps had been there for three months or more. The settlements, which authorities say were composed mostly of migrants and refugees from Afghanistan and Africa, had grown up around a major thoroughfare near a government-run refugee center established last year, according to The Associated Press. The news service says some 1,600 people were affected, while Reuters and other media outlets place the number around 1,000.

In the street you're struggling to survive, so you can't possibly do what you need to restart your life. And you're prey for smugglers and traffickers.\" As of last November, Eleanor reported that Paris police had \"cleared 22,000 migrants from tent cities on sidewalks and under train trellises\" in the span of a year and a half, moving them to migrant centers such as Morel's.

News of the operation Tuesday comes just days after the election of President-elect Emmanuel Macron, who has embraced a relatively open stance toward migrants, and mere hours after the United Nations announced a potential tragedy unfolding in the Mediterranean Sea. Two ships carrying migrants and refugees wrecked over the weekend, leaving up to 245 people missing and feared dead, according to the Office of the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees.

A small group of Jewish-American citizens from around New England celebrated their dual German citizenship at an understated ceremony last week at the German consulate office in Boston.  One of those in attendance was 59-year-old Larry Klein, of Newton, whose parents were German refugees from Nazi Germany. His mother and father fled to the U.S. in 1939 and 1940, respectively. His grandparents on his father's side were killed in Germany during the Holocaust and he says his family's relationship with its German heritage has always been complicated.  Reports of anti-Semitic incidents in the U.S. are up 86 percent so far this year, according to data released by the Anti-Defamation League. With that increase comes a new wave of interest in a decades-old German law reinstating German citizenship to Holocaust refugees and their descendants.  \"It's kind of actually ironic and surprising to be doing this only because I grew up in a family where going to Germany was anathema,\" Klein said. \"There's no way would we ever visit Germany. My grandmother wanted to teach us German as children and my parents told her, 'No, no don't do that.'\" A country like Germany ... espouses the beliefs and philosophy that actually is the way I'd like a country to behave. So, things come around in very interesting ways. Larry Klein  But Klein says he will be going to Germany \u2014 and he'll be doing so as a dual German citizen. The process he just completed is a constitutionally enshrined right established in post-World War II Germany allowing for the restoration of citizenship that was illegally deprived to German Jews under Nazi rule. For many in the room, there's both a practical and symbolic motivation for restoring their families' German citizenship. For Klein and his wife, it means easier travel around Europe. And also, a sort of plan B \u2014 something to keep in his back pocket amid what he calls an increase in the acceptance of hate speech here in the U.S.  \"The tone of this country at this point in time is disturbing. A country like Germany which, you know, has this history that obviously my family's well aware of, espouses the beliefs and philosophy that actually is the way I'd like a country to behave,\" said Klein. \"So, things come around in very interesting ways.\"  Klein's been thinking about starting the process for some time, but he says it wasn't until the November presidential election that he picked up the phone.  \"And so I called the consulate and she said, 'Yes, we have a program for that, and here's how you do it, and oh, by the way, you might imagine we've been very busy this week,' \" Klein explained.  The increased interest has persisted.  'I Needed Someplace Else To Go'  Ralf Horlemann, the consul general of Germany in Boston, says in the first quarter of 2016, 13 people of Jewish origin reclaimed their German citizenship through the Boston consulate. That number nearly quadrupled \u2014 to 49 \u2014 in the first quarter of 2017.  \"Although we don't have any firm statistical data on the reasons behind the application for naturalization,\" he said, \"we have seen a considerable increase in applications since, well the autumn, or the end of last year.\"  The numbers have increased so much at the Boston consulate that Horlemann decided instead of individuals coming into the office and simply picking up their paperwork, there will now be regular naturalization ceremonies.  And so it is, that in a meeting room at the German consulate office in Boston, nine Jewish-American citizens gathered around a conference table. Miniature flags representing Germany, the European Union and the U.S. decorated the room, and champagne chilled in the corner.  Horlemann addressed the group from a podium: \"You have made a choice and a decision to apply for the restoration of German citizenship. For some of you, it may not have been an easy decision given the reason why your families lost it in the first place and also the legacy of the Holocaust.\"  The decision to reclaim German citizenship was years in the making for Linda Heuman of Providence, R.I. Heuman's great-grandparents died in concentration camps and her grandparents, dad and aunt were all Holocaust refugees. Sensing a shift in the American political climate since the election of President Trump, she says the decision for her suddenly became clear. Linda Heuman, 53, receives her certificate of German citizenship from the German consul general in Boston, Ralf Horlemann.\n                \n                    \n                    Robin Lubbock/WBUR\n                    \n                \nhide caption Linda Heuman, 53, receives her certificate of German citizenship from the German consul general in Boston, Ralf Horlemann.  \"I just instantly felt like I needed someplace else to go. I have that somewhere in my history, like that visceral knowledge,\" Heuman said. \"With racism on the rise and anything might happen so, so that was my motivation for finally getting around to filling out the paperwork.\" And filling out the paperwork brought her on a journey she may not have otherwise experienced, learning about the orphanage her father and aunt lived in for a time and becoming closer to ancestors she never had the chance to meet.  \"I brought a picture with me today of my great-grandfather and I thought, you know, he lost, the family lost, everything when they left. ... I feel like today a tiny piece of everything they lost is being restored,\" she said.  Heuman says she plans to go back to Germany for a few months and visit the place her family called home for generations.",

            "article_content": "Trump's revised travel ban gets its first federal appeals court review. French voters elect a president. And ex-acting Attorney General Sally Yates testifies on Russia's meddling in U.S. elections.  RACHEL MARTIN, HOST: Today President Donald Trump's revised travel ban goes before a federal appeals court for the first time. DAVID GREENE, HOST: Yeah, so they're looking at whether the executive order from President Trump discriminates against Muslims and would therefore be unconstitutional. This is a panel of more than a dozen judges from five different states. And specifically, they're essentially deciding whether President Trump's own words about Muslims during the presidential campaign can be used against him here. It's words like these from a rally back in 2015. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Donald J. Trump is calling for a total and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States until our country's representatives can figure out what the hell is going on. MARTIN: All right, with us this morning is NPR's Joel Rose. Hi, Joel. JOEL ROSE, BYLINE: Hi, Rachel. MARTIN: What are the arguments that are going to be laid out today? ROSE: Well, as you say, opponents of this executive order are expected to use Trump's own words against him. They say that this is essentially - this is the Muslim ban that Trump and his advisers have been promising because it would block travel from six majority-Muslim countries. The government is going to argue that that was the campaign and that the court now should only look at the executive order itself and that the language of this order doesn't actually say anything about religion. The White House argues that this order as well as the earlier version that was blocked are all about national security. The administration wants to stop travel from these six countries until it can revamp security procedures because it says these countries are known havens for terrorists. MARTIN: So this is all about intent, trying to decide if you can discern the president's intention behind that ban. What can you tell us about the judges who are hearing this case? ROSE: So the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals is hearing the case today in Virginia. It's been considered a conservative appeals court. But that has been changing with new judges joining the bench. Democratic appointees now actually outnumber Republican appointees. And the court has clearly made this case a priority. It's a really unusual move. They're going to skip the initial hearing before a three-judge panel, which is usually what you get when you talk about an appeals court hearing. Instead, more than a dozen judges are going to hear this case all at once today. And the audience is going to be a little bit bigger than usual as well because they're going to allow audio of the hearing to be broadcast live. MARTIN: And there's another hearing, I understand, next week. This is about the same executive order. What's this about? ROSE: It is. There are two rulings about this executive order that are sort of on parallel legal tracks. Today's hearing's about the case of the ruling by a judge in Maryland. The hearing next week is about a ruling by a judge in Hawaii. That one not only put the travel ban on hold; it also is stopping the administration from suspending the U.S. refugee program. That's another court that is composed of a majority of justices appointed by Democrats. And no matter what happens in these two appeals courts, all roads are probably leading to the Supreme Court on this one. GREENE: You know, guys, what I'm interested in, talking about Donald Trump's words... MARTIN: Yeah. GREENE: It's when he said, until the U.S. can figure out what is going on. Like, I mean, it's been a couple months now since he introduced the first executive order. In theory, you know, the administration has been looking at these countries, doing whatever vetting they needed to do. You have to - you have to wonder if the administration already knows... MARTIN: Knows what's going on. GREENE: What's going on and whether there's really a reason to keep fighting for this or whether it's politics. I mean, it's been some time now. MARTIN: OK, NPR's Joel Rose talking through this story with us this morning. Hey, Joel, thanks so much. ROSE: Hey, you're welcome. MARTIN: All right, we're going to move... (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) MARTIN: And now we're going to move to France, where voters elected a new president over the weekend. GREENE: Yeah, what a big election - the centrist candidate, Emmanuel Macron, defeated far-right Marine Le Pen in a landslide. So he is now France's youngest ever president. Before this victory, he had never even held elected office. Macron now has to lead a country, though, that's been struggling with high unemployment and a wave of terrorist attacks, issues that sowed really, really deep divisions across the French electorate. MARTIN: All right, NPR's Frank Langfitt is on the line to talk about this. He's in Paris. Good morning, Frank. FRANK LANGFITT, BYLINE: Hey, good morning, Rachel. MARTIN: OK, Macron won. It doesn't mean the French are all on the same page about the direction they want their country to go, right? LANGFITT: No, not at all. And it was really interesting. I spent yesterday up in a place called Henin-Beaumont. It's a former coal town of about 20,000. It's Le Pen country. Her National Front actually runs the town. And it's only 90 minutes from - from here, from Paris, on high-speed train and a taxi. And it was such a contrast to life in Paris. You know, last night, you saw the images on TV, people waving the tricolor flags in front of the Louvre. When I was in Henin-Beaumont, I couldn't even find a bar with a TV to watch the returns. And I felt like it wasn't different cities but different planets. And it reminded me a lot - I used to work in Appalachia in Kentucky. And it reminded me a lot of where I lived there and the problems they faced. And of course, that area voted very heavily for Trump. So one of the questions for Macron is going to be, how do you bring economic hope to places like Henin-Beaumont that have fallen so far down economically and voted very strongly for Le Pen? MARTIN: So still, a lot of people voted for her, right? LANGFITT: Indeed. MARTIN: An estimated 11 million people... LANGFITT: Yeah. MARTIN: ...Voted for Le Pen. That's the most her party's ever gotten, I understand. He's going to have to reach out to those voters. LANGFITT: He is. And the other thing is like what David was pointing about, is these problems are not going away. There's a reason why people did vote for Le Pen - 23 percent youth unemployment rate here, spate of terrorism attacks as David mentioned, also concerns about migration. I was up in Lille yesterday - it's also a northern city - and talked to young women, who complained about - one woman who complained that a migrant was - had chased her recently and tried to get her bike from her, and also very concerned about terror attacks. And later on in the evening, after Macron won, I was talking to Corinne Mellul. She teaches political science at Catholic University up in Lille. And she cautioned Macron's supporters to kind of temper their euphoria. Here's how she put it. CORINNE MELLUL: There's a lot of anger. There's a lot of frustration, many grievances on the part of the voters who chose Marine Le Pen over Emmanuel Macron. And I think that Macron, in the next five years, will ignore these grievances and this anger at his own peril. MARTIN: So he's got to bring the country together in the next couple of months. LANGFITT: Indeed, yeah. GREENE: I mean, one of the challenges - you talk about bringing the country together. Let - let's imagine waking up as president of the United States without anyone from your own party in Congress. That is Macron's reality. It's a new party. He has a parliamentary election coming up. A quarter of the country didn't even vote in the presidential election. This is not a European leader with this huge, broad mandate or a lot of political capital right now. But, you know, after this victory, he's a 39-year-old with an enormous opportunity. MARTIN: All right, Frank Langfitt reporting from Paris and apparently traveling all over France - it's tough work. Thanks so much, Frank. LANGFITT: Happy to do it, Rachel. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) MARTIN: And on Capitol Hill today, former acting Attorney General Sally Yates is scheduled to testify on Russia's meddling in the U.S. elections. GREENE: Yeah, a lot of people have been waiting to see this. Yates, of course, was an Obama appointee and then spent a little bit of time, a real little bit of time - 10 days - in President Trump's Justice Department. She was fired when she said she would not defend the Trump administration's controversial travel ban. Now, today she is expected to testify that she warned White House officials about former national security adviser Michael Flynn and his contact with the Russian ambassador to the United States. Yates, we should remember, was supposed to testify before the House Intelligence Committee back in March. But that hearing was canceled. And because of that, some Democrats, like Congressman Adam Schiff of California, suggested that the White House was trying to muzzle her testimony. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) ADAM SCHIFF: It wouldn't surprise me at all if there was a vigorous pushback on having her testify. Among other things, how long did the president know that Michael Flynn had lied before he was willing to do anything about it? MARTIN: All right, NPR's national security correspondent Mary Louise Kelly is in the studio with us. Hi, Mary Louise. MARY LOUISE KELLY, BYLINE: Hi, Rachel. MARTIN: What do senators want to learn from Sally Yates? KELLY: Well, Sally Yates has become the star witness in what has got to be the most explosive contacts that have come to light yet between Trump aides and Russia - because, as David mentioned, she sounded the alarm bell on then national security adviser Mike Flynn and his contacts with the Russian ambassador. So the question's about what exactly she said when she warned the White House. As you heard Congressman Schiff there asking, who all knew about her warning? How long did they know? Why was Flynn able to continue as national security adviser for several weeks - working with top security clearance out of the West Wing of the White House for several weeks - before he was fired? You know, how much light Yates may be able to shed on any of those questions today in public testimony - this is the first chance to hear her account. MARTIN: As David mentioned, this has a political bent to it, right? Devin Nunes, former head of the House Intel Committee, canceled a previous hearing that she was supposed to appear at. And Yates drew a lot of praise from Democrats when she left the Justice Department, kind of hailed as this hero. Does partisanship taint her testimony in any way? KELLY: Well, she certainly has demonstrated that she's willing to be independent from the Trump administration. I mean, as we mentioned, she was - she was fired for refusing to defend the travel ban. And her testifying at all, just as a moment in this political drama, will be a big deal. Democrats howled when her previously scheduled testimony was canceled. The White House says, we didn't ask for it to be canceled; we will welcome her testimony. And today, we and the White House and everybody else are all going to get hear it. MARTIN: And lastly, James Clapper, director of national intelligence - former director of national intelligence under Obama - is testifying. What's he expected to say? KELLY: Right. So he never served the Trump administration. But he will be there to shed light on what the Obama administration knew and when about Russian meddling in the 2016 election. And as we know, still many outstanding questions there. MARTIN: NPR's Mary Louise Kelly. Thanks so much for coming in this morning. KELLY: You're welcome. Copyright \u00a9 2017 NPR.

            "article_content": "In his first few months as president, there's been enormous energy on the left against Trump's administration and policies. The question is how cohesive and lasting these protest movements will be.  AUDIE CORNISH, HOST: The Trump administration's first 100 days have been a very anxious time for the resistance. We're talking about progressive activists who have seen their ranks swell since Donald Trump was elected president. Now as Trump's agenda stalls, they're starting to feel more hopeful. NPR's Scott Detrow reports. SCOTT DETROW, BYLINE: For many progressives, election night 2016 is burned into their minds like a natural disaster or a terrorist attack. TIFFANY KANG: And processing that was definitely something that I'll always remember. It's almost like 9/11. DETROW: Tiffany Kang (ph) is standing on a balcony at a downtown Los Angeles loft office building. She's one of about 20 progressives there for a day of training for digital political organizing. AMY BIVEN: Because in 2017, it feels like it's all the unexpected, right? DETROW: Many in the room are like Amy Biven (ph) BIVEN: I sort of slid into some complacency after George W. Bush was out of office because I had the luxury of being able to do so. DETROW: Now Biven is back into political organizing, and she's looking for tools to make her actions more effective. All over the country but especially in deep blue cities like LA, progressives are organizing, rallying, calling their congressmen, donating to causes. And 100 days in, many feel like it's working. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) UNIDENTIFIED CROWD: Refugees are welcome here - no hate, no fear. Refugees are welcome here. DETROW: Searching for a high point of optimism from the first few months of the Trump era, Biven points to this spontaneous protest that followed Trump's first travel ban. BIVEN: People in the streets going to airports - and people hate going to the airport, especially in New York City. Anyone who's lived in New York City will tell you they'd rather eat broken glass. DETROW: Other resistors point to the failure to repeal Obamacare or national security adviser Michael Flynn resigning. Each Trump stumble leaves the resistance more energized. But Democrats in office are beginning to worry whether it will turn on them, too. Several miles north on the 405, a group of activists is settling into the back room of a bowling alley, getting ready for its monthly meeting. UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN #1: Please take a seat. We're going to get started. DETROW: The group organizes under the banner of Indivisible, thousands of similar local organizing efforts that have sprung up across the country. Everyone here is really frustrated with their congressman, Democrat Brad Sherman. And their beef has more to do with style than substance. JOHN PELZER: He doesn't do anything for International Women's Day - no tweet, no press release, no nothing. Even Trump did that. DETROW: That's John Pelzer (ph), who wants Sherman to be more aggressive, to take public stands against Trump like other Los Angeles area Democrats are doing. Sherman does have a solid liberal voting record. But for many in the room, that's not enough. They want him to be more active and confrontational. UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN #2: We are more progressive than you are. UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN #3: He hasn't been doing his job for 13 years. Why are we encouraging him? UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN #4: Yeah, but we haven't been participating either. We hadn't been participating until Donald Trump got elected. DETROW: Many members of the resistance are like Owen Ellickson. He was horrified by Trump in 2016 and spent most of the year poking fun at the Republican candidate by writing a Twitter account that imagined fake conversations between Trump and his advisers. OWEN ELLICKSON: And it was, I thought, good, silly fun that was undergirded by the fact that I thought he would not become our president. DETROW: Sitting outside at a South Pasadena cafe, the TV comedy writer explains how on November 9 he became all business - no more Trump jokes, just a lot of organizing and a lot more civic engagement. Ellickson is one of many progressives who are even starting to think with a whole lot of caveats of course that maybe in the end, Trump could be good for their cause. ELLICKSON: Not to dive into pop culture, but the end of the \"Watchmen\" comic book... DETROW: Confused - just stick with the comparison for a moment. \"Watchmen\" is a late-'80s graphic novel. ELLICKSON: ...Ozymandias creates an alien that falls from space, killing half of New York, and it is this external horror that forces the Americans and the Russians, ironically, to put aside their differences and avert the Cold War. It does feel like Trump is the (laughter) external squid that a lot of us needed to put our differences aside and really get engaged and worked up. DETROW: One big question is whether this can turn into something like the Tea Party, and the resistance can turn that anger into long-term political victories. Scott Detrow, NPR News, Los Angeles.

            "article_content": "France faces its most important presidential race in more than five decades. But polls show many French voters are undecided or might not vote at all.  RAY SUAREZ, HOST: France faces its most important presidential race in more than five decades. The country's been battered by high unemployment, a refugee crisis and terrorist attacks, but the rest of the world is really concerned about the two front-runners who are big critics of the European Union. One of them, Marine Le Pen, wants France to leave the EU, which would probably kill it and reshape the political landscape of Europe. The stakes couldn't be higher. So why are so many voters still undecided? NPR's Frank Langfitt explains from Paris. FRANK LANGFITT, BYLINE: Not only are many voters undecided, a lot say they may not even cast a ballot tomorrow. Samy Tadjadit is playing dice at his bar in the city's Bastille neighborhood. The election is right around the corner. So I ask... How are you going to vote on Sunday? SAMY TADJADIT: I don't know. I'll have to think about it. You know, I'm very confused. LANGFITT: Confused because he finds the political platforms vague. He's considering two left-wing politicians. But Tadjadit doesn't like any of the other leading candidates in a race that's too close to call. TADJADIT: For sure not Macron because he's full of nothing. Le Pen - it is not a choice. I don't know. And Fillon - you know, you hear all the stories about Fillon. LANGFITT: Francois Fillon is the political equivalent of a mainstream U.S. Republican, but he's mired in a corruption scandal, accused of employing his wife in a no-show government job worth hundreds of thousands of dollars. Emmanuel Macron is a centrist newcomer who's never held elective office. And Marine Le Pen is a far-right anti-immigrant candidate reminiscent of Donald Trump. And are you certain you'll vote on Sunday? TADJADIT: I'm not sure. I'll say I'm thinking about it. I think I'm going to decide on Sunday. LANGFITT: Decide on Sunday is something you hear a lot of in France right now. The country's at a crossroads, but most people are frustrated with the candidates and the whole political system. CORINNE MELLUL: There's a sense of exhaustion among voters. There's a sense of fatigue, of disillusionment. LANGFITT: Corinne Mellul teaches political science at Catholic University of Lille in northern France. She says many voters have lost faith in France's two major parties, the Republicans and the socialists. One or the other has controlled the president's office since the early 1980s but failed to fix big problems. MELLUL: Unemployment is chronically high. It has been for decades. I think France is also going through a crisis identity still trying to tackle the problem of Muslim integration. LANGFITT: And there's another big issue here in France that helped drive the Trump victory and Britain's vote to leave the European Union. THOMAS GUENOLE: The key theme of the electoral debate in United States, in United Kingdom, in France is globalization. LANGFITT: Thomas Guenole is a political scientist at Sciences Po, one of France's leading universities. He says more and more French are worried about their economic future, including blue-collar workers who've lost jobs to free trade. Sociologists sometimes call this growing class of anxious people the precariat. GUENOLE: Precariat is the part of the population that has financial difficulties at the very beginning of the month and that doesn't know where they will be next month socially and economically. LANGFITT: And, Guenole says, they often vote for political extremes, which helps explain France's fragmented electorate. Given the uncertainty surrounding tomorrow's vote, I asked Corinne Mellul, the other political scientist, whom she planned to support Sunday in the first round of the presidential race. MELLUL: I've been voting for decades in French elections, and this time I'm just clueless. LANGFITT: Why is it so hard to decide? MELLUL: I can't find someone for whom my dislike is light enough that I would consider voting for them (laughter). LANGFITT: So that means you can't even find a least worst candidate. MELLUL: Exactly. LANGFITT: Mellul says no one should be shocked by her distaste for the slate of candidates because, she says, many French voters feel exactly the same way.

            "article_content": "A shooting on Paris' famous Champs Elysees left one police officer dead and two seriously wounded. It happened as presidential candidates were debating on television, ahead of Sunday's election.  STEVE INSKEEP, HOST: America has just went through an experience similar to France. It's an election campaign punctuated by occasional episodes of political violence. In the United States last year, it was a series of shootings, including some by people who claimed allegiance to ISIS. In France, the last incident came in the center of Paris. Down the avenue from the Arc de Triomphe, a gunman killed a police officer before police killed him. It all happened just before a presidential election weekend that NPR's Frank Langfitt is covering in Paris. Hi, Frank. FRANK LANGFITT, BYLINE: Hey. Good morning, Steve. INSKEEP: What's it like walking around Paris right now? LANGFITT: Well, it's really interesting. As you point out, this is something that the United States has gone through but Paris has gone through even more. We've had these big attacks in the last two years. This is just the latest and much smaller. I was out last night at a bar doing - working on another story. And the bartender said, hey, did you hear the news? And, you know, we all read our phones. And then a lot of people just went back, frankly, to drinking and talking about other things. So I think that, obviously, this is a terrible thing. And it was right near the Arc de Triomphe. But at the same time, it's something that people in Paris have gotten, frankly - it's sad to say - more used to. INSKEEP: Now, you say talking of other things. Are they still talking about the presidential election? Is this the No. 1 topic of conversation in France? LANGFITT: Yeah. It's very easy to get people to talk about here. Everybody's talking about it. A tremendous number of people, though, actually don't know how they're going to vote. And some people I talked to you last night may not even vote at all. INSKEEP: OK. So here's the question. If you are ISIS and you stage an attack like this - and we don't really know that they staged it; we know they claimed credit for it - but if you're ISIS... LANGFITT: Right. We don't know that, yeah. INSKEEP: If you're ISIS and you're staging an attack, your purpose presumably would be to, in some way, influence the voting that follows. So that raises the question, does this actually affect how people are going to vote? LANGFITT: Well, so I went out this morning, Steve, to the rail station in Montparnasse. And I talked to at least a dozen people. And I heard pretty much the same thing. This is just sort of what you hear on the street, conventional wisdom. I was talking to - with this CFO from a telecom company. His name is George Bakell (ph). And here's the way he saw it. GEORGE BAKELL: People would massively vote for those candidates who are for security, against immigration and all that. And those two candidates are Marine Le Pen and Francois Fillon. INSKEEP: Would you just remind us why he would presume that people would vote for... LANGFITT: Yeah. INSKEEP: ...Le Pen because of a terror attack? LANGFITT: Well, first, Fillon - he's kind of a traditional Republican. And he's kind of a traditional - he's tough on security. But Le Pen is the one everybody here talks about. She is - it's fair to say - anti-immigrant, anti-Muslim. She also would like to leave the European Union. And people - some people at the rail station today - most of them thought that this would give her a boost in what's now an incredibly tight four-way race. INSKEEP: And do people agree that an attack like this would be good for Le Pen? LANGFITT: Well, so when I get back from the rail station, I get these callbacks from political scientists I've been talking to, analysts. And their take was very different from what you just heard from George. And they said kind of what I was hearing in the bar, or at least seeing in the bar last night, which is people are kind of used to this. They've already put it into their calculations. Also, they know Le Pen very well. And she's seen as very radical politically and not necessarily somebody who has a steady hand. So maybe this could help some other candidates who have more experience. So I was talking this morning with Thomas Ginoulei (ph). He studies voting behavior at Sciences Po; it's a top university here. And he had this really blunt assessment when we were talking. THOMAS GINOULEI: Who is stupid enough to change his or her vote because some guy decided to shoot a policeman and tried to shoot other policemen and a civilian? LANGFITT: And so what Thomas is kind of saying here, Steve, is if there's a strategy here, he does not think it's going to work. INSKEEP: So Frank, help us step back here. This was a dramatic election far, far before this shooting this week. People have described it as being an election in which the future of Europe is at stake. You've been talking with voters in France. What are the stakes as French voters see them? LANGFITT: Well, the way they see it is - you know, it's interesting. Terrorism has not been a big issue in this. It's really - there's chronic high unemployment here. There's loss of jobs due to globalization. Immigration is an issue, integrating Muslims. There's tons of corruption. And I think a lot of people here see it as something that - a turning point for France. What kind of a country is it going to be? Is it going to be more open, or is it going to do what we've seen in the United Kingdom with a vote to leave the EU and, to some degree with the Trump win, kind of backing away from the world? INSKEEP: Le Pen made news just in the last couple of days by saying, we don't want to turn the entire country into a giant railway station, a transit center for refugees, effectively, was what she was saying. But there is another point of view voiced by other candidates like Macron, the very young upstart candidate. What is the other point of view that's out there? LANGFITT: Well, the other point of view - it's really, you know, if you're going to really step back from this, this is about the future of the West and what kind of countries the West are going to look like. Are they going to be a place that welcomes everybody? Is this going to be a place where people can go and work in different countries? Is it going to be kind of the liberal Western order? Or is it going to be much more nationalistic and much more defensive? And so there are two very big competing ideas. And we're going to find out on Sunday who makes it to the next round and which of these ideas seems to be in ascendance. INSKEEP: And thanks for that reminder. The most likely result here, I guess, is you have two candidates, neither of whom have 50 percent and they go on to the next round of the election. Frank, thanks very much. LANGFITT: You're very welcome, Steve. INSKEEP: That's NPR's Frank Langfitt in Paris. Copyright \u00a9 2017 NPR.  All rights reserved.

Appreciated joining @POTUS for meeting with the Freedom Caucus again today. This is it. #PassTheBill pic.twitter.com/XG6lQIy5a6 Clinton made her observations in an address to the Professional BusinessWomen of California in San Francisco on Tuesday night. \"There's no place I'd rather be than here with you,\" she told the gathering, adding, \"other than the White House.\" Clinton said she was appalled by a photo that circulated last week of an all-male group of Republican lawmakers meeting at the White House with Vice President Pence discussing women's health care. And she chastised Trump, whom she did not mention by name, for having the fewest number of women in top jobs \"in a generation.\" There are just four women holding Cabinet-level jobs in the administration out of 23 such positions. Clinton had promised women would fill half of her Cabinet jobs. She also was critical of comments by White House press secretary Sean Spicer, who told American Urban Radio Networks White House correspondent April Ryan, \"Please, stop shaking your head,\" during Tuesday's press briefing. \"Too many women have had a lifetime of practice taking this kind of indignity in stride,\" Clinton said. She said the withdrawal of the GOP health care bill last week was \"a victory for all Americans,\" singling out efforts to end coverage mandates in particular. \"Really? Take away maternity care?\" she asked. \"Who do these people talk to?\" Clinton said the death of the measure was a sign that efforts to organize in opposition to Trump's agenda could work, citing the Women's March on Washington the day after Trump's inauguration. \"There were plenty of people, as you might expect, who wondered whether that level of energy and enthusiasm would be sustained and whether it would make any difference,\" Clinton said. \"I'm here to tell you, last week we saw the first indication that the answer to both of those questions is yes.\" Clinton has generally kept a low profile since her defeat in November, but has said that she intends to start speaking out again on issues. She was critical of the Trump administration's efforts to bar refugees from entering the country, and to take action against what Trump insists was voter fraud during his successful campaign last year. \"These are bad policies that will hurt people and take our country in the wrong direction.\" And referring to the hiking she has been seen doing with her husband, former President Bill Clinton, near their suburban New York home, she added, \"It's the kind of things you think about when you take long walks in the woods: Resist, insist, persist, enlist.\"",

            "article_content": "Martin Schulz, a former bookseller with no high school diploma, could become the next chancellor of Germany, thanks in part to an anti-Trump sentiment.  MICHEL MARTIN, HOST: Now to Europe where several top-elected positions are in play. In Germany, Chancellor Angela Merkel is seeking a fourth term this fall. But a challenger has emerged in the German race that polls suggest could give Merkel a fight. He is Martin Schulz, who was confirmed as the Social Democrats candidate for chancellor last week. NPR's Soraya Sarhaddi Nelson has this report from Berlin. SORAYA SARHADDI NELSON, BYLINE: Martin Schulz loves to crack jokes, as he did at a political gathering in a Bavarian beer tent earlier this month. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) MARTIN SCHULZ: (Speaking German). NELSON: He poked fun at the chancellor and her center-right party's tense relations with its Bavarian counterpart, comparing a recent comment she made to something a spouse might say before straying. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) SCHULZ: (Speaking German). NELSON: But Schulz told his fellow social democrats that the German election won't be anything like the recent American contest. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) SCHULZ: (Speaking German). NELSON: He said, even in a beer tent, a political opponent should be beaten with arguments, not insults. Schulz added, we could have a Donald Trump-style campaign, but we won't. Calling out Trump on his actions and foreign policies is something the two German candidates agree on. Although Schulz, who at 61 is a year younger than Merkel, is more direct. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) SCHULZ: (Speaking German). NELSON: In his speech, he accused the American president of demeaning women and minorities and threatening democracy with his attacks on the press. Merkel and Schulz also support a strong European Union and its obligation to take in refugees. But as people, the two candidates couldn't be more different. Merkel is a scientist with a Ph.D. in physical chemistry, the straitlaced daughter of a pastor who grew up in the former communist East Germany. Schulz, on the other hand, is a recovering alcoholic who never finished high school and hails from a small western German town near the Dutch border. His father was a policeman and his mother a housewife. Schulz's ambition wasn't politics but to be a soccer star, says Karl Lauterbach, his close friend and vice chair of the Social Democrats in the German Parliament. KARL LAUTERBACH: He was badly injured. He was no longer able to play. He had a drinking problem, and he also was threatened by unemployment and was working in a small bookstore which he owned but which was not going well. So he was living through a major crisis. NELSON: His friends say he rebuilt his life by turning to literature and writing. They say Schulz speaks at least five languages. He became the mayor of a small town in western Germany, and until earlier this year, served as president of the European Parliament. His normal-guy image appeals to many German voters, who feel disconnected from the political elite. But his critics claim Schulz will take Germany backwards. They object to his plan to roll back 15-year-old reforms credited with restarting the economy here but costing job security and welfare payments. Steffen Kampeter, who heads the Confederation of German Employers' Associations, says Germany faces stiff competition from China and Eastern Europe. He says doing away with reforms is a mistake and that whoever ends up in charge should find another way to reconnect with Germans who feel the reforms have made their lives worse. STEFFEN KAMPETER: So you have to take the concern seriously. But the message has to be that countries like Germany deeply integrated in global economy cannot just say bye-bye to them. NELSON: Some German voters already appear to be having second thoughts about Schulz. His double-digit lead last month evaporated, and he and Merkel are now running neck and neck.

            "article_content": "Canada has extended a broad welcome to refugees from around the world, including those who left the U.S. after losing hope of gaining asylum. But now more Canadians say it's time to close the door.  LOURDES GARCIA-NAVARRO, HOST: Thousands of people have been leaving the U.S. to seek asylum in Canada. They are migrants and refugees living in the U.S., but they fear being detained because of President Trump's tough immigration policies. They say they feel safer in Canada. So far, they've been welcomed with open arms. But as Brian Mann with North Country Public Radio reports, that may be changing. BRIAN MANN, BYLINE: To get a sense for just how different Canada's official attitude toward refugees and immigrants has been compared with the U.S., check out this moment with Prime Minister Justin Trudeau welcoming a family fleeing the Syrian civil war in December. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) PRIME MINISTER JUSTIN TRUDEAU: Seeing you here today - and I told myself I wouldn't get emotional about this. But of course... MANN: Trudeau, who heads Canada's Liberal Party, was crying with joy, wiping his eyes with a handkerchief. President Donald Trump, meanwhile, has pushed to implement a travel ban on refugees from Syria and other predominantly Muslim countries, warning that they could pose a security risk. Trudeau has sent a very different message, tweeting that Canada welcomes everyone. After November's presidential election, thousands of people living in the U.S., some with expired visas, others as undocumented workers, others seeking refugee status, began using a loophole in international law to go north, seeking asylum in Canada. Trudeau signaled that they, too, are welcome. And Mohammed Ahmed joined the exodus. He says he fled Pakistan to the U.S. because he feared violence in his home country. NPR couldn't confirm his immigration status in the U.S. But last month, he decided to leave New Jersey for Montreal, scrambling across the border into Canada on a snowy trail with his wife and two kids. MOHAMMED AHMED: They're treating us very well. They give us the shelters. And I hope my children's future will be good - will be great in Canada. MANN: He says he feels safer here, less likely to be sent back to Pakistan. MANN: People who apply for asylum in Canada are automatically given protected status. They're rarely detained. Ahmed has been assigned a lawyer to help him navigate the refugee application process, which is expected to take about six weeks. During the wait, he's been given a health care card. His kids have been assigned to school. And he has a temporary work permit, so he's searching for a job. But that welcoming tone appears to be shifting. With more than 25,000 people given permanent refugee status last year, politicians with Canada's Conservative Party say too many people are coming too fast. They warn that Canada's southern border is no longer secure. Ted Falk, a member of Parliament from the midwestern province of Manitoba, posted a video on Facebook blasting Prime Minister Trudeau. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) TED FALK: Your message of welcome to Canada to refugees is just an open invitation for folks that want to illegally cross into Canada. Come to Canada. Come any way you want - legally, illegally, it doesn't seem to matter. MANN: Falk says the loophole allowing people to come north from the U.S. and claim refugee status here should be closed. A Reuters poll released this week found that half of Canadians agree. They want people who enter the country illegally to be deported. Forty percent said asylum-seekers crossing from the U.S. might make Canada less safe. MANN: This is Parliament Hill in Ottawa, seat of Canada's national government. On a bright spring day, Louise and Don Milligan are visiting from Red Deer, a small city in the western province of Alberta. When I asked them about people coming across the border, Louise shakes her head and says something I don't quite catch. LOUISE MILLIGAN: (Laughter). MANN: I'm sorry? MILLIGAN: I said no. MANN: No to more refugees and migrants. Her husband nods his head in agreement. Don Milligan says Canada, like the U.S., should slow the flow of newcomers. DON MILLIGAN: There's no way to determine what are these people. Are they truly refugees? There's no way to know that. MANN: Canadian officials do put asylum-seekers through a series of security screenings. And they're vetted to determine whether they face significant threats in their home countries. There have been no reported cases in Canada - or in the U.S. for that matter - of refugees or asylum-seekers committing acts of terror. Judy Hepner from British Columbia was also visiting Parliament Hill. She says taking in vulnerable people is part of Canada's identity. JUDY HEPNER: I think we should welcome them. I'm of Mennonite heritage. My ancestors were harassed and chased around Europe. And they came to Canada because Canada welcomed them. How can I say that we don't let anybody else in? It makes no sense to me. MANN: For now at least, Prime Minister Trudeau is sticking with his more open-door approach. Canada's Liberal government has signaled that most of the families crossing the border from the U.S., unless they have criminal records, will be allowed to remain and start new lives here.

Many Dutch parties have said they won't work with Wilders' Party of Freedom. Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte dealt a sharp defeat to right-wing nationalist Geert Wilders in what was seen as the first of three electoral tests of populism on the European continent this year. Rutte's center-right VVD party took 33 out of 150 seats in the lower house of the Dutch parliament. Wilders' Party for Freedom got 20 seats and came in second. We were the 3rd largest party of the Netherlands.Now we are the 2nd largest party.Next time we will be nr. 1! pic.twitter.com/lKN5CFUhPT The left-leaning Dutch Labor Party, took a major hit, losing 29 seats. The GreenLeft Party gained 10. A new coalition government will be formed, but most Dutch political parties have said they won't work with the Party for Freedom. Wilders had hoped to notch a third big populist victory in the West since the United Kingdom voted to leave the European Union last summer and Donald Trump won last November in the U.S. Wilders ran on an anti-immigrant, anti-Islam platform, which included vows to close all mosques and ban the Quran. He had led in the polls for nearly two years before slipping in the last week or so before the election. \"The Netherlands, after Brexit, after the American elections, said 'whoa!' to the wrong kind of populism,\" Rutte said Wednesday. Still, Wilders' party picked up five additional seats in parliament \u2014 and the man known for his bleached-blonde pompadour vowed he would not go away. \"It's not the 30 seats I hoped for, but we have gained seats,\" Wilders said. \"This patriotic spring will happen.\" Even as he voted Wednesday, he warned, \"The genie will not go back into the bottle.\" Many Dutch who voted for parties other than Wilders' exhaled when they awoke to the news of his defeat this morning. Waiting for a bus in The Hague, Tamara Venema said she was happy to see Rutte come out on top and the Netherlands not follow the path of the U.K. and the U.S. \"I'm very glad that happened, because I was afraid Wilders would win and \u2014 after Trump and after Brexit \u2014 we were going to be the next polarized country,\" she said. In the end, Wilders' policies and rhetoric \u2013 he had called Moroccans \"scum\" and suggested the Netherlands deport some \u2013 proved too extreme for voters in a small country that was built on foreign trade and immigration and has been traditionally viewed as liberal and tolerant. Wilders' second-place finish also played well in European capitals. Wilders had repeatedly said he wanted to pull the Netherlands out of the EU. French President Francois Hollande called Rutte's win a \"clear victory against extremism.\" The next electoral battle focusing on populism will take place in France, where Marine Le Pen, leader of the National Front, is running for president. The first round of voting is set for next month.",

Exit Polls suggested a poor showing for his party.\n                \n                    \n                    Peter Dejong/AP\n                    \n                \nhide caption Firebrand ethno-nationalist lawmaker Geert Wilders prepares to cast his vote in the Dutch general election Wednesday in The Hague, Netherlands. Exit Polls suggested a poor showing for his party. Updated at 1:50 a.m. ET Thursday Early results in the Netherlands indicate Prime Minister Mark Rutte's VVD Party will win Wednesday's parliamentary election, while populist Geert Wilders' Party for Freedom will come in third. Rutte's party was on track to win 32 seats in the lower house of parliament, while Wilders' party was projected to win 19 seats. The full results of the election \u2014 which in the Netherlands is conducted on paper ballots using red pencils \u2014 are not expected to be known until Thursday morning here. But if early results are accurate, the tallies will be seen as a significant defeat for Wilders and his brand of ethno-nationalism. In interviews across the country in the past week, even Wilder's supporters found some of his rhetoric too incendiary, including his suggestions that the Netherlands kick some Moroccans out of the country. Voting in The Hague Wednesday morning, Wilders tried to portray populism as something that would surge forward regardless of the results here. \"Whatever the outcome of the election today, the genie will not go back into the bottle,\" he said. \"People feel misrepresented.\" Indeed, Wilders did tap into very real concerns in the Netherlands about immigration, national identity and government austerity. The country took in more than 50,000 refugees in 2015 during the European migration crisis. That created strains on social services and some people complained that Dutch citizens lost out on public housing to help people fleeing Syria. Wilders supporters saw him as the defender of white, native-born Dutch. Wilders is a political insider, one of the longest serving members of parliament here, but he captured global attention this year because of the surge in populism that began last June when the United Kingdom stunned the world and voted to leave the European Union. Donald Trump continued what looked like a possible trend with his upset victory last November, and Wilders hoped to become the third populist politician to defy the odds. As news of the early results spread, governments in Western Europe appeared to breathe a sigh of relief. \"The Netherlands, oh the Netherlands you are a champion!\" tweeted Peter Altmaier, German Chancellor Angela Merkel's chief of staff. \"Congratulations on this great result.\" But there is more to come. The next \u2014 and far more consequential \u2014 test for political populism begins next month in France where the National Front's Marine Le Pen is running an anti-immigration, anti-European Union campaign.",

It's seen as a potential test of the power of populism in Europe.  RACHEL MARTIN, HOST: Polls are now open in the Netherlands for an election that many around the world are watching closely. It is seen as a potential test of the power of populism in Europe after the United Kingdom's vote to leave the European Union and the victory of Donald Trump here in the U.S. NPR's Frank Langfitt is at a polling station in Amsterdam. And he joins me now. Good morning, Frank. FRANK LANGFITT, BYLINE: Good morning, Rachel. MARTIN: Frank, remind everyone why this race is getting so much attention. LANGFITT: Well, they're really two words - Geert Wilders. He's the right wing populist candidate here. He's anti-immigration, anti-refugee, anti-Islam. His slogan is let's make the Netherlands ours again. And he's been playing to a lot of anxiety here over social tensions with immigrant communities that have come in many years ago from North Africa but also Europe's refugee crisis. Fifty thousand people came here in 2015. So there's a lot for him to work with, frankly. MARTIN: What are you seeing and hearing at the polls this morning? LANGFITT: Well, I'm in north Amsterdam. It's a mix of white Dutch and immigrants. And turnout is a little lower than before. But it's still earlier in the day. The last election was 2012. A lot of support here for left wing parties, lots of criticism for Wilders. I was speaking with a woman who works here in the city government. Her name is Andrika Blooming (ph). She's in her late 30s. And here's what she had to say. ANDRIKA BLOOMING: Well, I'm quite ashamed of the guy and how he's making the Netherlands look really stupid. And on the other hand, he has a voice that people like, a lot of people in the Netherlands. So that's really worrying. MARTIN: So she says there are a lot of people who appreciate what Wilders is saying. What are you hearing this morning from Wilders supporters? LANGFITT: I haven't met many here this morning. But I was down south in Wilders country over the weekend where he was campaigning. And a lot of people were saying that the government seems more concerned about refugees than native-born Dutch. And I also met this Wilders supporter. His name's Ralph Jansen (ph). He's a CPA. And he says that a lot of the backers for Wilder's party - it's called the Party for Freedom, PVV for short - is - a lot of supporters are a lot broader than people think. It's a much broader demographic. And here's how Jansen put it. RALPH JANSEN: The Dutch people think that all the voters of the PVV are low educated, low paid, stupid people, and they just go for a populist guy but I'm not. I'm working for European Commission in Brussels. I have a very high education. So I know what I'm talking about. I'm not stupid guy. But still I vote for him. MARTIN: It's interesting. There are some parallels to the U.S. presidential election that we just had. LANGFITT: There were a lot of parallels here, Rachel, between what we saw in the United States during basically Trump's election also in Brexit it in the U.K., which I covered. You hear a lot of those same kinds of tensions both economically and in terms of people's views of migrants. The question is, how's he going to do today? He'd been leading the polls for a long time. So he's getting a ton of attention internationally. But he has been slipping recently. And there are a lot of Dutch voters, even people who like Wilders, who say he's a bit too extreme. So it's going to be very, very interesting to see how this all turns out. MARTIN: NPR's Frank Langfitt in Amsterdam. Thanks so much, Frank. LANGFITT: Happy to do it, Rachel.

Wilders' Freedom Party had been leading in the polls until recently. After the United Kingdom's vote to leave the European Union and Donald Trump's U.S. victory last year, political analysts wonder if populism will gain ground on the European continent amid the impact of a migration crisis and dissatisfaction with the European Union. With elections approaching in France, Germany and the Netherlands, the question has gained urgency. The answer may start to become clearer Wednesday, when the first of these elections takes place and Dutch voters head to the polls. Among the front-runners in the Netherlands parliamentary election is Geert Wilders' right-wing Freedom Party. Wilders, who's been compared to Trump by the Dutch press and some voters, is a colorful figure, known for his bleached-blond pompadour and extreme rhetoric. He has been running an anti-Islam, anti-immigrant \"Holland First\"-style campaign and has vowed to \"make the Netherlands ours again.\" The Freedom Party had been leading in the polls, but recently slipped. So how much does Wilders matter? Two political analysts in Amsterdam weigh in. Andr\u00e9 Krouwel is a political scientist at the Free University of Amsterdam and Emilie Van Outeren, a political reporter with NRC, a leading Dutch newspaper, spent five months in the U.S. covering the presidential race. Their responses have been condensed and edited for space. Who are Wilders' supporters? Krouwel: He actually mobilizes quite a broad range of people. There's a lot of older voters who feel very insecure about how this country is changing with immigration. They feel like the undeserving are coming into our country, taking away or undermining our welfare state, our healthcare. The other group is people who are at the lower end of the labor market and they feel threatened by labor immigration. Then there's, of course, just people who think that Dutch culture is going down the drain by immigration. They don't like the multicultural society, or they feel like their neighborhood is changing too much. Do you see any connections between the concerns of these voters and some of the concerns that played out in the Brexit vote and Trump victory? Krouwel: I think they're exactly the same people. They are people who not necessarily are poor, but actually have a lot to lose. Trump voters, they earned over $70,000 per annum. You see a large part of the Wilders vote, they're earning a lot of money. Most of them earn more this year than last year, but they feel that they might lose everything. So, it's not what they have, it's what they think they might lose. How does the European migration crisis, the refugee crisis, fit into this? Krouwel: If every night you see hordes of people [on TV] walking down roads with whole families moving this way, people feel anxious about it. They feel like hordes of immigrants and refugees are coming into our country and we're swamped by them. That's also the language that Wilders is using, that we're [being] taken over and we have to take back our country. Is Wilders the Dutch Donald Trump? Van Outeren: No, he's so establishment. He's never held a job outside of the government. Trump's appeal was obviously that he was an outsider and this was a change election for the United States. What you do see is the language. That's something that they definitely have in common and this nativist idea, Trump's slogan \"America First.\" Wilders has made his slogan \"Let's Make the Netherlands Ours Again.\" So there are a lot of similarities, but not as many as people might think. And then there's the hair, of course. If Wilders were to get the most votes, what kind of impact would that have in the Netherlands? Van Outeren: What is new is that in this campaign, other parties have already said they exclude governing with Wilders. So what it will mean is that if his anti-immigration, anti-Islam, anti-EU narrative wins and draws people to the polls, then that says something to the leaders of all these other parties \u2014 and they will run a very different government with him as a huge opposition force than they will if he comes in third. How significant is this election in the broader Western context? Krouwel: If you see Brexit, which is an anti-elite vote, if you see Trump beating the hell out of the Democrats, you can see that, wow! Two times, the whole establishment is put to shame. If Wilders also succeeds and then in France, [National Front leader] Marine Le Pen wins in the summer, and then in Germany, the anti-immigration [Alternative for Germany] party does, well, yeah, then I would be really worried. What I think will happen is that Wilders will not be first, but second or third \u2014 not play a role in government. In Germany, the Social Democrats will probably be big and govern with the Christian Democrats, very normal coalition. Le Pen will not be president of France, so I think, come early 2018, it has all blown over. But then again, a small thing can happen. What do you fear most in politics? Events, because they can change the course of history.",

ROBERT SIEGEL, HOST: First the United Kingdom voted to leave the European Union. Then Donald Trump won our presidential election. And the Netherlands might be the third country to ride that wave of populist nationalism. The Dutch head to the polls Wednesday. The Freedom Party led by Geert Wilders is running an anti-immigrant, Holland-first campaign. NPR's Frank Langfitt has been following Wilders on the campaign trail, and he has this report. FRANK LANGFITT, BYLINE: Mandy Janssen waited in the tiny town of Valkenburg in the south of the country Saturday to meet the man she believes will look out for Dutch people, Geert Wilders. Mandy is 28 and works in elder care. She says the Dutch government has slashed funding for old people while spending a fortune on refugees who've poured in here from wars in the Middle East. MANDY JANSSEN: All the people are welcome I mean if you live in a war. And we totally understand that as people, they also deserve a good life. But you have to take care of your own people first. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN: (Foreign language spoken). GEERT WILDERS: Ja. UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN: (Foreign language spoken). WILDERS: Ja. LANGFITT: Wilders arrives and stops to speak to a crowd of reporters. There's news to discuss. The Dutch government has just blocked Turkish officials from coming to the Netherlands to rally the many Turks who live here to vote in a referendum back home. The government said the events would constitute a, quote, \"risk to public order and security.\" Wilders takes credit for pushing the head of the ruling Liberal Party, Prime Minister Mark Rutte, into taking a hard line against the Turkish government. WILDERS: Without our pressure in the elections, our government would not have done so - so excellent decision. LANGFITT: Later that night, the confrontation would spark violent protests by Turks in Rotterdam. Back in Valkenburg, a reporter asks if Islam threatens Europe. WILDERS: It certainly is a threat. It's an existential threat. I'm not talking about all the Muslims. But the Islamic ideology is an ideology of violence, of hate, of submission and not of assimilation. And I believe Islam and freedom are incompatible. LANGFITT: This sort of rhetoric explains the scrum of more than two dozen cops and security agents who surround Wilders as he greets supporters. Al-Qaida and ISIS have threatened to kill him. Wilders is wearing a bulletproof vest beneath his gray suit coat. (LAUGHTER) WILDERS: (Foreign language spoken). LANGFITT: Smiling and relaxed, he poses for a selfie with Mandy, the elder care worker, and her sister Denise. (CROSSTALK) LANGFITT: His signature mane of bleach blonde hair dominates the photo. Afterwards, like many Wilder voters, Mandy says she wishes he would temper his language. JANSSEN: Sometimes he says things and you're like, OK, that's not the right way to say it. But... LANGFITT: Give me an example. JANSSEN: There was a moment when he was in a bar, and he asked people, do you want more or less... DENISE: Moroccan people. JANSSEN: Everybody was - less, less, less, less. That was very big thing in Holland. DENISE: Too extreme. JANSSEN: That's Denise speaking. But she says it won't stop her from voting for Wilders. DENISE: Because all the good things he stands for kind of outweigh the extreme things. LANGFITT: Andre Krouwel is a political scientist at the Free University of Amsterdam. He says Wilders has tapped into anxiety among various Dutch who feel they're losing their place in the world, including the kind of people Mandy and Denise look after. ANDRE KROUWEL: There's a lot of older voters who feel very insecure about how this country's changing with immigration. They feel very vulnerable because they can't improve their life conditions anymore. And they feel like the undeserving are coming into our country, taking away or undermining our welfare state, our health care. LANGFITT: Krouwel doesn't think Wilders will do well Wednesday. After leading in the polls, he's been slipping. And even if he wins the most seats in Parliament, other major parties say they won't work with him. But Krouwel says Wilders has driven the political conversation in Holland to the right. KROUWEL: The right-wing parties which will enter government will have taken onboard his points and also the whole rhetoric of this election. Fifty percent of all debate is about his issues. LANGFITT: As Krouwel puts it, even if the Freedom Party wins zero seats in Parliament, Wilders has already succeeded. Frank Langfitt, NPR News, Valkenburg, the Netherlands.

This week, he lost his case in court. Some lawmakers argue that cases like this prove there's a need for new, tougher libel laws. Breitbart News has yet to launch its proposed German-language website, but it's already causing confusion in Germany. In January, police in the city of Dortmund had to debunk a Breitbart report about an alleged mob of 1,000 men chanting \"Allahu akbar\" and setting fire to a church on New Year's Eve. The report was widely shared on social media, but Dortmund police clarified that there had been no such attack, nothing \"extraordinary or spectacular\" had happened and New Year's Eve had in fact been \"rather average to quiet.\" Like many Americans, Germans are wising up to the proliferation of \"alternative facts.\" But others are simply overwhelmed. Angelika Siegner, 65, says it used to be easy to know what sources to trust and not. Growing up in communist East Germany, she would ignore party propaganda and get her news by tuning in surreptitiously to West German television. But faced with social media news feeds these days, she feels confused. \"We don't know what's true anymore or what's a lie,\" Siegner says. \"It's so difficult to keep up. So we try and feel it out, we ask our friends what they think and often we all draw the same conclusions.\" As people rely more on what their friends or loved ones think, investigative reporter David Schraven says journalists in Germany have to accept that they are no longer as influential as they once were. \"It used to be the trust in a brand. You trusted your newspaper,\" Schraven says. \"Now you've got friends and friends of friends on Facebook and you trust your friend.\" Schraven is the co-founder of Correctiv, a nonprofit investigative newsroom based in Essen and Berlin that's about to partner with Facebook to fact-check German-language stories flagged as suspicious by Facebook users. Supported by foundation funding and staffed by investigative journalists, Correctiv is not being paid by Facebook for the partnership. Once Correctiv has fact-checked the flagged stories, it publishes its research on Facebook and allows users to make up their own minds. Stories verified as fake are marked as such, but Facebook does not intend to remove the content, according to Schraven. Schraven describes most fake news sources in Germany as sympathetic to Russia, opposed to the European Union or \"fascist.\" But whatever their stance, he says, they all aim to distort political debate and destabilize democracy \u2014 a major concern for Germany in a crucial election year. (The European Union, too, is concerned and has started its own efforts to debunk fake news stories.) Schraven stresses that simply identifying disinformation is not enough to fight it. Like it or not, he says, the fake news industry represents serious competition and journalistic integrity alone won't cut it. He says traditional media must emulate the techniques used so successfully by the shady purveyors of falsehoods. Germany's most popular newspaper, Bild, is among those worried about losing readers to news disseminated on social media. In a bid for greater transparency, it now makes a journalist available every day to take readers' questions live via an online video link.\n                \n                    \n                    Sean Gallup/Getty Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption Germany's most popular newspaper, Bild, is among those worried about losing readers to news disseminated on social media. In a bid for greater transparency, it now makes a journalist available every day to take readers' questions live via an online video link. \"We need to acknowledge that our audience is not there where we want it,\" Schraven argues. \"So we need to follow the audience, we need to work on social media.\" Schraven says the best strategy for traditional media is to assume the role of a quotable, trusted online friend. Even Germany's biggest-selling newspaper, Bild, with a daily readership of almost 10 million, is concerned about losing readers to the wilds of social media. Julian Reichelt, the head of Bild's editorial board, says to retain loyal readers in the current climate, you have to open up all available communication channels. \"We don't believe that you win people back by insulting them or alienating them,\" Reichelt explains. \"We believe that you have to engage them, you have to talk to them.\" Losing readers' trust is a serious issue for Bild. Just last month, Reichelt had to retract and apologize for a story the paper published claiming a \"mob of Arab men\" had sexually assaulted women in a Frankfurt restaurant. It turned out to be entirely fictitious. Many snickered at the apology, since the tabloid has a reputation for coverage that's heavy on sensationalism and gossip. Since retracting the story, Bild has employed an ombudsman and has started offering up one of its journalists every day to take questions from readers via a live online video link. Reichelt says this promotes greater accuracy \u2014 and more fair-minded discussion. \"Throughout the 30 minutes of such a chat, the number of people yelling at you and putting out wild conspiracy theories decreases while the number of people making reasonable arguments increases,\" Reichelt says. Germany's media are not alone in taking a stand against disruptive disinformation. Chancellor Angela Merkel's government is also working to draft legislation that may impose hefty fines on social media sites that don't promptly remove false stories and hate speech. Some lawmakers are calling for libelous content to be removed within 24 hours. Justice Minister Heiko Maas is expected to present a draft bill this week. Earlier this week, a court in southern Germany rejected a case brought against Facebook by Anas Modamani, a Syrian refugee in Germany. He'd taken a selfie with Angela Merkel in 2015 that was shared in Facebook posts that falsely claimed he was a terrorist. Jens Zimmermann, a lawmaker with the SPD party, a member of Merkel's ruling coalition, says cases like this show that German libel laws need to be updated for the digital world. But, he admits, this is a tricky task. \"Freedom of speech is paramount to our democracy, and we by no means want an Orwellian ministry of truth,\" Zimmermann says. \"But we have to make it quite clear that the same libel laws and laws against incitement of hatred apply online as they do offline.\" With an election approaching, critics say lawmakers are moving too slowly and it may already be too late for legislation. The media, they argue, must act now to ensure that a well-informed electorate goes to the polls in September.",

            "article_content": "Refugee resettlement has been a divisive issue nationwide, and in Rutland, Vt., a city of 16,000 that was planning to take in 100 Syrian refugees this year, it may have cost the pro-refugee mayor his job.  ARI SHAPIRO, HOST: Resettling refugees has proven to be a divisive subject across the country, including in Rutland, Vt. It's a city of 16,000 which this year became home to a handful of Syrian refugees. And as Vermont Public Radio's Nina Keck reports, the refugee question may have just cost the mayor his job. NINA KECK, BYLINE: Last April, Rutland Mayor Christopher Louras surprised many when he announced that he wanted Rutland to become Vermont's newest refugee resettlement community. It was the right thing to do, said Louras, who believed welcoming Syrian families would provide much needed youth and diversity to Rutland. But many locals weren't convinced. Believing the mayor negotiated the plan in secret without voter input, many pledged to oust Louras in the next election. That election came yesterday, and challenger David Allaire's message of trust and transparency resonated. A longtime member of the city's Board of Aldermen, he turned anger over resettlement into a stunning political upset. DAVID ALLAIRE: I have no issues with refugees themselves. What I have an issue is - is with the process and with the refugee resettlement organization and their lack of information and transparency right up to this very moment. KECK: Allaire says that if resettlement is to go forward, it will have to be done in a different manner. He didn't elaborate, and to be clear, city officials don't have much of a say in refugee resettlement, an issue handled at the federal level. At the polls Tuesday, Jillian Kellogg cited refugees as one of the deciding factors in her vote for Allaire. JILLIAN KELLOGG: It's not that refugees shouldn't have somewhere place - someplace safe to go if they need to get away from a bad situation, but they need to be properly vetted in order for them to come and for us to open up our city to them. KECK: The current vetting process is intensive and typically takes about two years. President Trump signed an executive order promising even more stringent vetting. Outgoing Mayor Christopher Louras says he'd hoped the election would be about things like repairing the city's aging infrastructure or figuring out how best to attract jobs, things city leaders can really have a hand in. But he says Rutland is a microcosm of a broader dialogue that's going on about refugees and immigrants, and he has no regrets about his stance. CHRISTOPHER LOURAS: If refugee resettlement cost me my job, so be it. I'm proud of that. If that's what cost me my job - bringing those nine people here, bringing those five children here to rebuild their lives - good. That's fine. KECK: Rutland was supposed to take in 100 Syrian refugees this year. Only two families have arrived, and whether more will come is unclear. For NPR News, I'm Nina Keck. Copyright \u00a9 2017 NPR.

            "article_content": "Research shows that schools treat black and white children differently. But in one town in Maine, Somali students are leading workshops on their culture for teachers and administrators.  DAVID GREENE, HOST: Over the last 15 years or so, thousands of refugees have flowed from Somalia into the small, historically white town of Lewiston, Maine. For many of the youngest refugees, the move has meant adjusting to a new school and a school climate that can make them feel rejected. Maine Public Radio's Robbie Feinberg reports on a group of students trying to change that by teaching their teachers about what it means to be a refugee. ROBBIE FEINBERG, BYLINE: Lewiston High School junior Hodan Mosae (ph) cringes when she talks about a moment in the school cafeteria last November. Mosae says she and her friend, both refugees, walked into the lunchroom in the days leading up to the election. She says they joked about a student's Donald Trump shirt. HODAN: And he was like, yeah, when Donald Trump becomes president, you won't be here. Like, you'll be kicked out. FEINBERG: How does it feel to hear that stuff? HODAN: I was, like, shocked. FEINBERG: Yeah. HODAN: I was really, really shocked. FEINBERG: Nearly a quarter of the students in Lewiston High School are African refugees. Yet inside, many say they're still treated like outsiders. There's the name calling from other kids. But junior Maryamo Elmoge says it comes from teachers, too. According to federal data, the black, mostly African students here receive suspensions at a rate 60 percent higher than the student body as a whole. MARYAMO: Or like, oh, that's the black kid that always gets in trouble. So they always assume that you'll get in trouble or you're always that bad kid. Like, we don't want them to think that way of us. FEINBERG: About a year ago, about 20 of these students got together as part of an after-school leadership group. They complained to each other about this unequal treatment. But instead of stopping there, these students decided they wanted to do something about it, to gather the school's mostly white teachers in a room, sit them down and educate them about their culture. Principal Shawn Chabot says he was initially reluctant about the idea. SHAWN CHABOT: You want to believe that everybody treats everyone, regardless of their culture or their race, equally. But I think we'd be putting our heads in the sand if that was reality. FEINBERG: Chabot says after he heard these students' stories and the data they brought forward on racism and discipline, he saw they were serious. And last fall, he agreed to let them lead a training for more than 50 school staff. UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN: All right. So we're going to go ahead and get started. FEINBERG: Now every month, students, administrators and teachers keep that conversation going inside a basement classroom. Today, the group discusses why so many students are tardy. ABDUL MOHAMED: What really helps with that is communication with students. FEINBERG: Student Abdul Mohamed tells his story. He says he's late because he doesn't feel his teachers care much for him or other refugees. MOHAMED: I don't really have a connection with a lot of my teachers. So if they don't - like, if I go to class and if I'm late, they wouldn't care. They'll just mark me absent. FEINBERG: Mohamed says he feels getting a detention won't change the fact that teachers don't care about him. PAULA GERENCER: I think that's an unfair assumption. FEINBERG: Teacher Paula Gerencer interjects. She says if any student was absent a lot, a staff member would reach out. GERENCER: From a teacher's point of view, somebody probably hopefully would say something. MOHAMED: Well, maybe. I don't know. FEINBERG: These kinds of conversations aren't easy. But they are making a difference. English teacher Donna Olsen says the students made her see that she needs to explain why she's punishing a student and let them know they're not getting in trouble just because they're African. DONNA OLSEN: I really need to be clear on when I have a conversation with a student or when I - even if there's a consequence for a behavior that I don't find I approve of, I need to be really clear about the reasons behind it. FEINBERG: As for the refugees, they're now even working with school staff to help shape policy around race. In a community where they're often shut out, the students say leading these trainings has helped them find their voice. For NPR News, I'm Robbie Feinberg in Lewiston, Maine.

            "article_content": "Voters in the Netherlands go to the polls on March 15, with an anti-immigrant populist leading the pack in parliamentary elections.  ARI SHAPIRO, HOST: 2016 was a banner year for populist nationalism and a rough one for international institutions. First the U.K. voted to leave the European Union in the Brexit vote. Then Donald Trump won the U.S. election on an America-first platform. Two upcoming elections in Europe will show us whether 2017 will bring more of the same. In a moment, we'll talk with our correspondent in France - first, a look at the Dutch parliamentary elections happening next month. Renegade politician Geert Wilders hopes to ride the populist momentum, as he runs on an anti-immigrant, anti-Islam agenda. NPR's Frank Langfitt is in the port city of Rotterdam and joins us now. Hi, Frank. FRANK LANGFITT, BYLINE: Hey, Ari. SHAPIRO: Geert Wilders is not a new figure on the political scene in the Netherlands. Remind us of his story. LANGFITT: Yeah, he's been actually in Dutch Parliament for nearly 20 years, and he's the leader of the PVV. That's the party for freedom. He wants to ban the Koran, close mosques. And following in what happened in the U.K. with the vote last summer, he'd love to take the Netherlands out of the European Union. He's a flamboyant guy, very articulate and has this bleach blonde pompadour. Many people liken him to Donald Trump in style and definitely rhetoric and say that he's begun to really normalize political speech that here previously was out of bounds. SHAPIRO: How's that working out for him? Is his party doing well in polls? LANGFITT: Well, he was actually leading since November, doing very well. But recent polls - he's fallen behind the liberals, the biggest ruling party here. And if true, there are a couple of theories behind why this might be happening. One is, he's been under death threats for years. He can't go out and campaign too much. I was actually talking to a critic of Wilders today in the south of the city, and he said, you know, this guy is just running a campaign on Twitter. The second theory is that, you know, Mr. Trump has had a pretty rough first few weeks in Washington, and there's a concern here among some people that if they vote for Wilders, they might get the same kind of disruption that we've seen back in the U.S. SHAPIRO: And what are you hearing from people who support Wilders? LANGFITT: Well, I went to a small city not too far from here called Spijkenisse, and it's the only place that Wilders actually campaigned so far. And I heard very similar concerns about immigration that I heard when I was covering the vote to leave the EU in Britain. And it's good to remember back in 2015, the height of the European refugee crisis here, there were more than 50,000 people from Africa and the Middle East in refugee centers in the country. And a lot of the complaints I heard today are about influx of migrants and refugees over the years - hearing complaints about crime, changing in culture in neighborhoods, people not speaking Dutch - so people feeling a bit alienated in their own communities. SHAPIRO: Beyond immigration, are there other issues where people have really resonated with what Wilders is saying? LANGFITT: Well, I - it was really interesting. I had a conversation today - fascinating one - with a steelworker, a guy named Cor. He's 61. He's in really bad shape physically. He's got three herniated discs. The government has raised the retirement age, so he's just going to have to keep working. He was actually very tempted to vote for Wilders because Wilders has promised to help older people. And also, this guy Cor - he's angry with the government. And it reminded me a lot of voters that I talked to in northern England who voted for Brexit, you know, to leave the European Union in part because they felt abandoned by politicians down in London. SHAPIRO: What would the implications of a Wilders win be beyond the Netherlands? LANGFITT: Well, even if he wins - and everybody points this out - he can't form a government because he won't be close to having a majority in Parliament. The other big parties hate him, and they say they're not going to work with him. But symbolically, it could be important, and it could give the sense of momentum of the far-right heading into the next contest of course which is coming up in France. SHAPIRO: NPR's Frank Langfitt speaking with us from Rotterdam in the Netherlands, thank you. LANGFITT: Happy to do it, Ari. Copyright \u00a9 2017 NPR.  All rights reserved.

Royal Canadian Mounted Police are reporting a flurry of illegal crossings into Canada in recent months. Officials say Quebec province has seen the highest influx of people seeking asylum, with many crossing in snowy, remote areas in northern New York. One illegal crossing area that has become particularly popular among immigrants is in Champlain, N.Y., in the northeast corner of the state. At the end of Roxham Road, there's a big dead end and a \"Road Closed\" sign \u2014 but there's also a very heavily trafficked, trodden route through the snow that goes over into Canada. From the ditch, the border is about 15 feet away, and the Mounties \u2014 the Canadian police \u2014 wait on their side for those who will cross the border next. \"They'll be walking \u2014 you'll see whole families, like two adults and like three children most of the time,\" says Matthew Turner. \"They'll be walking down the road with suitcases and backpacks.\" Turner and his family moved into a trailer on Roxham Road in October. He says that, since then, he has seen people walking past his house, as well as a steady flow of taxis driving by. Taxis like the blue Honda minivan that rounds the corner. It's stopped by U.S. Border Patrol agents, but after the officer inspects the passenger's paperwork, the cab is allowed to continue. At the road's end, a young woman with an infant gets out of the taxi. She doesn't want to talk and seems to have limited English. She hugs the baby to her chest and, with her free hand, pulls a black suitcase on wheels. As she moves toward the ditch, several Canadian police officers approach on their side. One officer speaks out, saying, \"You have to go through the, the custom, the border \u2014 but if you do cross here, you'll be arrested and then we'll take you in charge, OK?\" The woman nods and steps toward them. The Canadian policeman offers to carry her baby as she makes her way through the slippery snow path. She hands the child to him and then takes the hand of another officer who helps her to the road on the Canadian side.

The Royal Canadian Mounted Police are reporting surges in illegal crossings in Canada in recent months. The police bring out a child car seat and place it in their cruiser. The woman is arrested, and she and her child are driven away from the border. The whole thing takes about six minutes. People who work with immigrants in Canada say these border-jumpers would rather be arrested in Canada than live in fear of how U.S. officials might handle their cases. \"There's quite an increase in people walking through illegally,\" says Cpl. Camille Habel, spokeswoman with the Royal Canadian Mounted Police. She says that after the Mounties arrest those who cross the border illegally, the police can only detain them for up to 24 hours before either releasing them or presenting them in front of a judge. \"Once that we do all our checks and that we can confirm that they're not a threat to national security, we hand them over to [the Canadian Border Service Agency] who then start the immigration process,\" Habel says. Habel won't give any information about the woman and child who crossed into Canada from upstate New York, but officials with the CBSA say that if they determine that she isn't a danger of a flight risk, the agency will release her and her baby. It's then up to a tribunal to evaluate her candidacy for refugee status. That woman's experience is not unique, though. At least two other families crossed into Canada at Roxham Road on Wednesday, knowingly walking into police arrest.",

President Trump says he is looking at \"tweaking\" portions of the North American Free Trade Agreement that deal with trade between the U.S. and Canada. Trump spoke at a brief news conference after meeting with Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau at the White House on Monday. Trump said U.S.-Canada trade is \"a much less severe situation\" than trade with Mexico. Trudeau pointed out that Canada is the largest trading partner of 35 states in the U.S., and that trade between the two countries is responsible \"for millions of good paying jobs on both sides of the border.\" The two leaders also addressed immigration, where their differences are far greater. Trump praised Homeland Security Secretary John Kelly, whose department oversees Immigration and Customs Enforcement, and which last week conducted what it termed \"targeted enforcement operations\" that resulted in 680 arrests. Trump said he promised during the presidential campaign to \"get the criminals out, the drug lords, the gang members,\" and said, \"We're getting them out.\" Trudeau said his country, which has accepted nearly 40,000 refugees from Syria in the past year, \"has always taken our responsibility toward security very seriously and our allies including the United States understand this focus very well.\" But, he said, \"the last thing Canadians expect is for me to come down and lecture another country on how they choose to govern themselves.\" He said his role is to govern in a way that reflects Canadians' approach \"and be a positive example in the world.\" Trump also said North Korea, which announced it had launched a ballistic missile over the weekend was a \"big, big problem,\" and that the U.S. \"will deal with that very strongly.\" He did not elaborate. Neither of the two U.S. reporters called on during the press conference asked Trump about the launch.",

The Trump administration continued to play loose with facts in week three. President Trump took aim at one of his favorite targets \u2014 the media \u2014 accusing them of not reporting terrorist attacks. The very list of attacks the White House released hours later contradicted those claims. Trump again cited incorrect statistics on the country's murder rate, though a day later he did use the right numbers. Press secretary Sean Spicer had his own \"Bowling Green massacre\" moment when he referred multiple times to a terrorist attack in Atlanta that never happened. And at the end of the week, President Trump again brought up false claims that there were illegal voters in the November election. But the number of false claims we're finding have decreased this week. We've highlighted eight issues or statements below. And throughout the week you can find us annotating the president's tweets for more context, too: \"It's gotten to a point where it's not even being reported. In many cases, the very, very dishonest press doesn't want to report it. They have their reasons and you understand that.\" Trump speaking on Monday to U.S. service members at MacDill Air Force Base in Tampa, Fla., claiming that the media weren't covering terrorist attacks and may have ulterior motives for doing so Later Monday night the White House put out a (typo-ridden) list of 78 attacks to back up that surprising allegation from the president. But instead their list included many high-profile terrorist attacks that had, in fact, drawn wall-to-wall media coverage, such as the June 2016 Orlando nightclub shooting and recent terrorist attacks in San Bernardino, Calif., and in Paris and Nice, France. As Politifact noted, \"the media reported on every one of the incidents in some fashion, except an alleged October 2015 nondeadly attack in Egypt that we could not independently verify. Whether the media covered the events enough is a matter of opinion, but it would be wrong to suggest the events weren't covered at all.\" In an interview which aired Monday with Fox News's Bill O'Reilly, Trump claims only 109 people were affected by travel ban The chaos that the hastily-implemented executive order unleashed two weeks ago was way more far-reaching than that. Politifact found that, \"On top of 60,000 valid visas affected by the order, there could be an additional 64,000 admitted refugees barred entry to the United States. That's nearly 1,140 times as many people as Trump claimed.\" Trump in a Tuesday meeting with U.S. chiefs of police and sheriffs: \"I'd say that in a speech and everybody was surprised because the press doesn't like to tell it like it is. It wasn't to their advantage to say that. But the murder rate is the highest it's been in, I guess, 45 to 47 years.\" Trump has made similar incorrect claims about the murder rate many times and has been fact checked on it many times. As NPR's Camila Domonoske reported this week: \"According to the FBI, the murder rate for 2015, the last year for which data are available, was 4.9 per 100,000 people. Every year between 1965 and 2010, the FBI reported a higher rate than that.\" On Wednesday, Trump correctly cited murder statistics the day after making the mistake, meriting a CNN headline. White House press secretary Sean Spicer cites a non-existent Atlanta terrorist attack These claims in fact came last week but gained attention this week. CNN broke down how three times, Spicer talked about a terror attack in Atlanta. The Atlanta police department told CNN that they had \"no record of an Islamic attack in the City of Atlanta,\" and that the last terror attack had been the 1996 Olympic bombing which was done by a U.S. citizen protesting abortion rights. This week, the White House confirmed that Spicer had meant to refer to the recent night club shooting in Orlando. Trump attacks CNN's Chris Cuomo on Twitter Chris Cuomo, in his interview with Sen. Blumenthal, never asked him about his long-term lie about his brave \"service\" in Vietnam. FAKE NEWS! CNN's Chris Cuomo interviewed Connecticut Sen. Richard Blumenthal on Thursday morning about Blumenthal's reports that Supreme Court Neil Gorsuch had called Trump's attacks on the judiciary \"demoralizing.\" Trump then tweeted that Cuomo had not asked Blumenthal about a years-old controversy, in which Blumenthal had falsely stated that he served in Vietnam. Cuomo responded by showing that he had, in fact, asked Blumenthal about his past falsehoods. Yemen raid \u2014 success or failure? The first military raid that Trump ordered as president has been the subject of much controversy after it resulted in the death of nearly two-dozen civilians and U.S. Navy SEAL Ryan Owens. Spicer defended it in his Tuesday briefing, calling it \"highly successful\" and said that \"anybody who undermines the success of that raid owes an apology and [does] a disservice to the life of Chief Owens.\" He was referring to Arizona Sen. John McCain, who had characterized the raid a failure. Trump swiped back at McCain, a former Vietnam POW on Twitter. As NPR's Domenico Montanaro, Tom Bowman and Danielle Kurtzleben reported, \"The binary choice of success or failure in this instance is a false one. But the raid clearly did not go as planned \u2014 and the public posture of the White House does not indicate it sees lessons to be learned for the future.\" Also, Trump has repeatedly called into question the success of the Iraq War where thousands of U.S. soldiers died. Ivanka Trump and Nordstrom My daughter Ivanka has been treated so unfairly by @Nordstrom. She is a great person -- always pushing me to do the right thing! Terrible! Trump called out the retailer on Twitter this week after they decided to stop selling his daughter's fashion line, and later Spicer characterized the decision as a backlash against the president's policies. However, Nordstrom said they made the decision over a month ago \"based on performance.\" They told NBC News in a statement that, \"Over the past year, and particularly in the last half of 2016, sales of the brand have steadily declined to the point where it didn't make good business sense for us to continue with the line for now.\" The Washington Post's Fact Checker gave Trump's claim four pinocchios. White House counselor Kellyanne Conway then took the defense of Ivanka Trump a step further, actively hawking her goods on a Fox News appearance. NPR's Jim Zarroli has more on the conflict of interest quagmire those statements opened for the government employee. Trump brings up voting fraud allegations \u2014 again It had been a while since Trump brought up his (without-any-evidence) allegations of widespread voter fraud, and the investigation he promised during his first week in office has never materialized. But Politico reported that, Thursday, in a meeting with 10 senators about his Supreme Court nominee Judge Neil Gorsuch, Trump again trotted out the wild accusations. According to the site, Trump claimed that both he and former New Hampshire Sen. Kelly Ayotte, who is helping to shepherd Gorsuch on Capitol Hill, would have won if not for \"thousands\" of voters \"brought in on buses\" from neighboring Massachusetts to vote \"illegally\" in the Granite State. Trump lost New Hampshire and Ayotte lost her bid for re-election. New Hampshire Secretary of State Bill Gardner told the Boston Globe that there was no proof of busses of illegal voters at polling places, \"suggesting that an unusually large number of voters would have drawn attention.\" Trump also went on to claim that if Ayotte had not distanced herself from Trump during the campaign she would have won. Ayotte initially said she wouldn't endorse Trump but would vote for him, but after an explosive 10-year-old video of Trump making vulgar remarks surfaced, Ayotte said she would write in Vice Presidential nominee Mike Pence instead. Ayotte actually ran far ahead of Trump in New Hampshire, losing to Democrat Maggie Hassan by just 743 votes. However, Trump lost the state to Democrat Hillary Clinton by 2,736 votes.",

RACHEL MARTIN, HOST: At the same time those judges were hearing arguments over President Trump's immigration order, a plane originating from Turkey landed at Chicago's O'Hare airport. The plane was carrying two Syrian refugee families. Susie An from member station WBEZ was there for their arrival. SUSIE AN, BYLINE: Sister and brother Aya and Mohammad Haj Khalaf had just gotten off work from their new food-packing jobs. They were eager to finally reunite with their older sister's family, especially their baby niece. AYA HAJ KHALAF: I want my niece because I very miss her. MOHAMMAD HAJ KHALAF: Hug my niece and my sister is dream. AN: The welcome party at O'Hare's international terminal was lively with colorful signs and gifts, including a stuffed animal for the baby. But the backdrop was tense as TVs broadcast the hearing over the travel ban. Five members of the Haj Khalaf family - mother, father, two brothers and a sister - were resettled in Chicago in September, before the presidential election. Since then, they've been busy. Actress Julia Sweeney is part of the family's mentoring team. JULIA SWEENEY: We, like, just met with the family, took them grocery shopping, helped them with doctor appointments - taking them out trying to show them how to do the subway system, bus system. AN: Baraa, the oldest sister, was supposed to arrive with her husband and daughter last week but were caught in the crosshairs of the executive order indefinitely banning Syrian refugees. After a federal judge temporarily halted that order, the family was able to fly to Chicago. After what seemed to be a speedy process through customs, the final members of the Haj Khalaf family were welcomed with cheers and tearful embraces. (CHEERS, APPLAUSE) AN: The eight family members were finally reunited. Older sister Baraa Haj Khalaf spoke about her arrival through translator Suzanne Sahloul. BARAA HAJ KHALAF: (Foreign language spoken). SUZANNE SAHLOUL: And this is what she expected from the American people, that they are so warm and welcoming. AN: Baraa says she's looking forward to rebuilding their lives in what she calls the country of dreams. For NPR News, I'm Susie An in Chicago. Copyright \u00a9 2017 NPR.  All rights reserved.

The refugee resettlement agency uses donations to furnish apartments for newly arrived refugees. Many resettlement agencies are relieved refugees can once again come to the U.S. now that a federal judge has blocked President Donald Trump's executive order that suspended the refugee program. So far, the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals has denied a request by the Trump administration to restore the temporary refugee ban. But this open door to refugees could close at some point depending on what the courts decide. Many refugees and workers at resettlement agencies are stuck in limbo. \"I don't know how long I will have this job, because we are thinking there will be some layoffs if this continues,\" says Omar Mohamed, a case manager for Church World Service of Lancaster, Pa. Local agencies worry they will no longer get the federal funding they need to provide services not only to new arrivals, but also to refugees still getting settled into their new country. Mohamed says there's still a lot of work for case managers to do with refugees after they move into their new homes. \"Everything is new to them \u2014 this new culture, new people, new language,\" he says. \"We have to teach them from zero.\" Mohamed Muhumed was recently reunited in Lancaster, Pa., with his wife, Ferehiya Areb Tahir, and their four children, who arrived in the U.S. from a refugee camp in Ethiopia 10 days before President Trump announced his temporary suspension of the refugee program.\n                \n                    \n                    Hansi Lo Wang/NPR\n                    \n                \nhide caption Mohamed Muhumed was recently reunited in Lancaster, Pa., with his wife, Ferehiya Areb Tahir, and their four children, who arrived in the U.S. from a refugee camp in Ethiopia 10 days before President Trump announced his temporary suspension of the refugee program. Mohamed Muhumed's family arrived in the U.S. about three weeks ago. He recently moved into a three-bedroom apartment in Lancaster with his wife and their four children. An orphan at three years old, Muhumed fled Somalia and waited 23 years in a refugee camp in Ethiopia to be resettled. In 2014, after multiple interviews and security screenings, he finally moved, by himself, to central Pennsylvania, where he now works as a fork-lift driver. His wife and children joined him in Lancaster 10 days before Trump announced his temporary ban on refugees. \"I feel very, very happy,\" says Muhumed, who adds that his family had \"good luck\" to arrive before Trump's executive order. In Philadelphia, Paw Wah doesn't know if she'll ever see her family reunited. She escaped persecution as a member of the Karen community, an ethnic minority in Myanmar, also known as Burma. Last year she moved out of a refugee camp in Thailand with her husband and their three young children, leaving behind their eldest daughter. Wah was planning to make a meal of fish paste, vegetables and soup to welcome her daughter to Philadelphia in late January \u2014 until Trump issued his refugee order. The flight to the U.S. for Wah's daughter was canceled and hasn't been rebooked yet, according to staff at the Nationalities Service Center, a refugee resettlement agency in Philadelphia that would help her once she gets off the plane.

They've also heard from a lot of people in Philadelphia who want to help. \"We actually just closed off our volunteer applications for the moment, just because we've sort of reached capacity,\" Jenson says. In Lancaster, a group of leaders from different refugee communities recently met to discuss what more they can do. \"We, the refugees and immigrants that are qualified to vote, we have to show at the polling stations in numbers, because politicians look at numbers,\" said Joseph Sackor, a former refugee who fled civil war in Liberia before he became a U.S. citizen. Sackor added that it's time for more refugees to register to vote once they get citizenship and to reach out to elected officials \u2014 for themselves and for others hoping to build a new life in America.",

It's only the second week of the Trump administration, but there has been a continued tension with facts. In his first week, the president boasted about his inaugural crowds and doubled down on false claims that there were millions of illegal voters who swayed the results of the popular vote. This week, the White House pushed back on claims about the immigration and travel ban the president signed; an adviser used a Kentucky massacre that never occurred to make an argument; the press secretary thundered over (non-)\"identical\" National Security Councils; and the president referred to refugees as \"illegal immigrants\" and kept touting the size of his electoral win, including support from black voters and Latinos.   1. \"It really is a massive success story in terms of implementation on every single level.\" \u2014 senior administration official Sunday on the travel/immigration ban and its implementation Scenes at major international U.S. airports in the U.S. showed the implementation of the order rocky. There was confusion about whether it applied to green card holders and U.S. legal residents. A 5-year-old boy was detained for hours. More than a dozen congressional Republicans broke ranks and criticized the rollout of the order, even Trump allies. \"We all share a desire to protect the American people, but this executive order has been poorly implemented, especially with respect to green-card holders,\" Senate Foreign Relations Committee Chairman Bob Corker, R-Tenn., said in a statement. Some agencies or officials who would be tasked with implementing it weren't briefed with sufficient time before the order was signed. Trump defended that in a tweet saying he didn't want to give bad dudes a heads up: If the ban were announced with a one week notice, the \"bad\" would rush into our country during that week. A lot of bad \"dudes\" out there!  2. \"These seven countries, what about the 46 majority-Muslim countries that are not included. Right there, it totally undercuts this nonsense that this is a Muslim ban.\" \u2014 White House counselor Kellyanne Conway on Fox News Sunday It's true that the words Muslim or Christian never appear in the executive order. And it's true that it doesn't ban all Muslims around the world. But the order does effectively ban Muslims from seven majority-Muslim countries and prioritizes Christians (and conceivably other religious minorities). Trump himself in December 2015 called for \"a total and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States until our country's representatives can figure out what is going on.\" Trump supporter and former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani said on Fox News on Sunday that Trump originally wanted a Muslim ban but asked how to do it legally so it became about dangerous countries instead of religion. \"When he first announced it,\" Giuliani said, \"he said, 'Muslim ban.' He called me up, he said, 'Put a commission together, show me the right way to do it \u2014 legally.' \" Trump himself stressed in an interview with the Christian Broadcasting Network, Christians would get special priority. The countries on the list are not just majority-Muslim; they are all almost entirely Muslim, as the Boston Globe's Matt Viser pointed out: Maybe \"majority Muslim\" is wrong. It's \"almost all Muslim\":Iran: 99.7Yemen: 99Iraq: 98.9Somalia: 98.9Sudan: 97Libya: 96.6Syria: 90  3. \"My policy is similar to what President Obama did in 2011 when he banned visas for refugees from Iraq for six months. The seven countries named in the Executive Order are the same countries previously identified by the Obama administration as sources of terror.\" -- President Trump, in a statement on Facebook defending his policy The Trump administration defended its choice of the seven countries by pointing out that the Obama administration had identified them as \"countries of concern,\" but unlike Trump's order, Obama's did not bar people from entering the U.S. The Obama change stemmed from two Iraqis who were arrested in Kentucky (more on that later in the week). Their fingerprints were found in Iraq on an improvised explosive device targeting Americans. That caused the Obama administration to slow down the process of admitting Iraqis, but it never stopped it.  4. \"I mean New York Times has called me wrong from the beginning. They actually apologized to their readers. They lost a lot of subscriptions because \u2014 not because the readers even like me. They say 'how inaccurate could you be?' \" \u2014 Trump, in an interview with Christian Broadcasting Network on Sunday Trump has made similar claims about the Times \"apologizing\" before, but such claims continue to not be true. As we recently wrote in a fact check about a Trump tweet: \"New York Times Publisher Arthur Sulzberger Jr. and Executive Editor Dean Baquet did write a letter to readers after the surprising election conclusion examining the paper's coverage. In the note, they acknowledged that 'after such an erratic and unpredictable election there are inevitable questions: Did Donald Trump's sheer unconventionality lead us and other news outlets to underestimate his support among American voters?' And a column from the paper's public editor (or ombudsman), Liz Spayd, pointed out problems with its data/forecasting vertical that predicted that Hillary Clinton had an 80 percent chance of winning the election. She also argued that the paper's reporters could have done a better job of tapping into 'the sentiments of Trump supporters.' \" However, neither of those pieces constitutes an apology.  5. \"And we did better with the Latino community. ... Better than Romney, better than just about for a long way.\" \u2014 Trump to CBN, Sunday Trump received 28 percent of the Latino vote, according to 2016 exit poll data compiled by CNN. Romney received 27 percent of the Latino vote in 2012. The margin of error on each of those polls is plus or minus 3 percentage points, according to Edison Research, the organization that conducted the polls. As far as performing better with Hispanics than past candidates, that's not really true, either. John McCain received 31 percent of the Latino vote in 2008, and in 2004, George W. Bush received 44 percent of the Latino vote \u2014 a figure that is often pointed to as a high-water mark for Republicans with that demographic.  6. \"And the Cuban-Americans, I got 84 percent of that vote. And they voted in big numbers.\" \u2014 Trump to CBN, Sunday It's not clear where Trump got this number. It's true that Cuban-Americans tend to be more conservative than other Latino voters. But at least in the state with by far the most Cuban-Americans, the Trump share of the vote wasn't nearly this high. According to the Pew Research Center, just over half (54 percent) of Cuban-Americans in Florida \u2014 home to two-thirds of all Cuban-American eligible voters \u2014 voted for Trump. In fact, Cuban-American voters have grown less Republican over the years. According to Pew, nearly two-thirds of Cuban-Americans were Republican or Republican-leaning as of 2002. As of 2013, it was just 47 percent. NPR has reached out to the White House for a source on this figure but did not receive a response.  7. The president tweeted blame at Delta Airlines on Monday. Only 109 people out of 325,000 were detained and held for questioning. Big problems at airports were caused by Delta computer outage,..... But while Delta did experience an outage that affected many flights on the ground, that problem was reported on Sunday night. Those delays began well after protests started breaking out at airports across the country on Saturday in response to Trump's executive order on refugees, which was issued on Friday.  8. \"The Principals Committee is merely the NSC minus the president. The idea is that the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff and the DNI are being downgraded or removed is utter nonsense.\" -- Spicer on Monday The Principals Committee under George W. Bush, whom Spicer referenced in his briefing, indeed did not specifically include the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff or the director of national intelligence (or, at the time, the director of central intelligence, as the DNI did not exist yet). Rather, the Principals Committee said that the DCI and chairman would \"attend where issues pertaining to their responsibilities and expertise\" were going to be discussed, as NPR's Domenico Montanaro pointed out in a fact check this week. However, the DNI and chairman were regular members under the Obama administration, according to one February 2009 memo. Here is the text of that list: \"The NSC Principals Committee (NSC/PC) will continue to be the senior interagency forum for consideration of policy issues affecting national security, as it has been since 1989. The National Security Advisor shall serve as Chair, and its regular members will be the Secretary of State, the Secretary of the Treasury, the Secretary of Defense, the Attorney General, the Secretary of Energy, the Secretary of Homeland Security, the Director of the Office of Management and Budget, the Representative of the United States of America to the United Nations, the Chief of Staff to the President, the Director of National Intelligence, and the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff.\" The latest action from the White House is clearly different, moving the DNI and chairman back to attendees only at certain meetings: \"The PC shall have as its regular attendees the Secretary of State, the Secretary of the Treasury, the Secretary of Defense, the Attorney General, the Secretary of Homeland Security, the Assistant to the President and Chief of Staff, the Assistant to the President and Chief Strategist, the National Security Advisor, and the Homeland Security Advisor. The Director of National Intelligence and the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff shall attend where issues pertaining to their responsibilities and expertise are to be discussed. The Counsel to the President, the Deputy Counsel to the President for National Security Affairs, and the Director of the Office of Management and Budget may attend all PC meetings.\" In addition, Stephen Bannon, the president's chief strategist, is now a regular attendee of the Principals Committee. That is one big way in which Trump's NSC really is not like Obama's or Bush's.  9. \"He's aware of what people have been saying. But I think, by and large, he's been praised for it.\" \u2014 Spicer at Monday's press briefing, referring to the White House Holocaust Remembrance Statement that left out any mention of the Jewish people Only white nationalists were celebrating the carefully parsed statement, with controversial alt-right leader Richard Spencer praising it as the \"de-Judification of the Holocaust.\" According to Politico, the White House even nixed a State Department statement that did mention Jewish victims. White House spokeswoman Hope Hicks defended the wording of the original statement, noting that while 6 million Jews were killed in the Holocaust, 5 million others were also killed, including \"priests, gypsies, people with mental or physical disabilities, communists, trade unionists, Jehovah's Witnesses, anarchists, Poles and other Slavic peoples, and resistance fighters.\" That is true, but the express purpose of the Holocaust was to exterminate the Jewish people, and minimizing that has been the goal of Holocaust deniers, white nationalists and neo-Nazis. The Holocaust Memorial Museum criticized the statement, noting that \"Millions of other innocent civilians were persecuted and murdered by the Nazis, but the elimination of Jews was central to Nazi policy.\" The Republican Jewish Coalition (which is heavily backed by GOP megadonor Sheldon Adelson) also called out the wording, saying, \"The lack of a direct statement about the suffering of the Jewish people during the Holocaust was an unfortunate omission. History unambiguously shows the purpose of the Nazis' final solution was the extermination of the Jews of Europe. We hope, going forward, he conveys those feelings when speaking about the Holocaust.\"  10. \"It's not a Muslim ban. It's not a travel ban. It's a vetting system to keep America safe.\" \u2014 Spicer briefing, Tuesday Several administration officials \u2014 including Spicer \u2014 called this a travel ban, as this CNN video shows. President Trump himself tweeted that it was a ban, though Spicer claimed that was because \"he's using he words that the media is using.\" In a tweet one day after Spicer tried to make this factually inaccurate defense, Trump again called it a ban.  11. \"If you remember I wasn't going to do well with the African-American community, and after they heard me speaking and talking about the inner city and lots of other things, we ended up getting \u2014 and I won't go into details \u2014 but we ended up getting substantially more than other candidates who had run in the past years.\" \u2014 Trump remarks at an African American History Month listening session, Wednesday Trump received 8 percent of the African-American vote in 2016, compared with the 6 percent received by Mitt Romney in 2012 and the 4 percent received by McCain in 2008. So he registered better numbers with African-Americans than the past two Republican candidates. However, George W. Bush received the support of 11 percent of African-Americans in 2004 and 9 percent in 2000. So Trump isn't right here. Given margins of error, Trump performed roughly as well as the last handful of Republican candidates with African-American voters \u2014 perhaps better than Obama's opponents did, but nothing out of the ordinary.  12. Trump tweeted of \"thousands of illegal immigrants\" that the Obama administration agreed to take in from Australia. Do you believe it? The Obama Administration agreed to take thousands of illegal immigrants from Australia. Why? I will study this dumb deal! But, as we explained over at our Tweet annotator, they are neither \"thousands\" nor \"illegal immigrants.\" There are about 1,250 people, who are seeking asylum \u2014 refugees who have fled their home countries seeking safety \u2014 many of whom are children. NPR's Two-Way blog has more.  13. \"It's hard to ever call something a complete success, when you have the loss of life or people injured, but I think when you look at the totality of what was gained to prevent the future loss of life ... it is a successful operation by all standards.\" \u2014 Spicer on Thursday That is starkly different from the way the New York Times described it the day before. \"As it turned out,\" Eric Schmitt and David Sanger wrote, \"almost everything that could go wrong did.\" CENTCOM said the U.S. recovered information helpful to counterterrorism analysts. Spicer said the operation yielded valuable intelligence about al-Qaida in the Arabian Peninsula. But NPR's Alice Fordham and Tom Bowman reported that \"local witnesses disputed that, saying the special operations troops never entered any buildings to take any computers or documents.\" NPR: \"The U.S. military has opened an investigation, and U.S. military officials tell NPR that civilians were indeed among the victims. Taken together, claims and counterclaims from the U.S. military and local residents described a chaotic operation, one that drew sharp criticism from Yemeni officials who usually support the U.S. The aftermath of the raid shows the potential dangers if the U.S. military relaxes its current restrictions about using force and protecting civilians, which President Trump has asked the Pentagon to review.\" The Times: \"The death of Chief Petty Officer William Owens came after a chain of mishaps and misjudgments that plunged the elite commandos into a ferocious 50-minute firefight that also left three others wounded and a $75 million aircraft deliberately destroyed. There are allegations \u2014 which the Pentagon acknowledged on Wednesday night are most likely correct \u2014 that the mission also killed several civilians, including some children. ... \"[T]he mission's casualties raise doubts about the months of detailed planning that went into the operation during the Obama administration and whether the right questions were raised before its approval. Typically, the president's advisers lay out the risks, but Pentagon officials declined to characterize any discussions with Mr. Trump.\"  14. \"I bet, there was very little coverage \u2014 I bet it's brand-new information to people that President Obama had a six-month ban on the Iraqi refugee program after two Iraqis came here to this country, were radicalized \u2014 and they were the masterminds behind the Bowling Green massacre. I mean, most people don't know that because it didn't get covered.\" \u2014 Conway on MSNBC's Hardball, Thursday. There was no \"Bowling Green massacre\" at all, and Conway has acknowledged she misspoke. She asked for \"grace\" for the mistake. 1/2: Honest mistakes abound. Last night, prominent editor of liberal site apologized for almost running a story re: tweet from fake account 2/2: yet won't name him, attack him, get the base 2 descend upon him. Same with MLKJr bust fake story. It's called class, grace, deep breath Conway was referring to the two Iraqi refugees referenced in Point 3. But neither had planned or executed an attack in Kentucky. Conway's further assertion that President Obama had a six-month ban on Iraqi refugees is also false. The White House slowed down the approval process but did not halt it altogether. (In her tweet, she also notes something repeatedly used by Trump and others in the administration \u2014 a mistake a Time reporter made, reporting that a bust of Martin Luther King Jr. had been removed from the Oval Office. He quickly corrected the mistake.) NPR's Sarah McCammon and Domenico Montanaro contributed to this report. ",

The multi-campus church with a membership of more than 20,000 is the largest Methodist church in the U.S.\n                \n                    \n                    Courtesy of The United Methodist Church of the Resurrection\n                    \n                \nhide caption The Rev. Adam Hamilton preaches to the congregation at United Methodist Church of the Resurrection outside of Kansas City. The multi-campus church with a membership of more than 20,000 is the largest Methodist church in the U.S. Clergy across the country are sermonizing about events in Washington, D.C. For Rev. Adam Hamilton, that is both a challenge and an obligation. Hamilton founded the United Methodist Church of the Resurrection in Kansas in 1990, hoping to attract what he describes as thinking Christians with little or no engagement with their faith. The congregation began meeting in the chapel of a funeral home. Today, it's a multi-campus church with a membership of more than 20,000. It's the biggest Methodist church in the country, and it has been cited as one of the most influential churches in America. The new sanctuary that's about to open at the main campus just outside Kansas City hosts the largest single stained glass window in the world. Hamilton tells NPR's Robert Siegel he didn't set out to claim that record. But he did set out to build a church that will serve as a house of worship for a century, if not more. \"We'll baptize 30,000 babies in here,\" he says. \"We'll give 30,000 children their third-grade Bibles. This congregation over the next 100 years will give away 50,000 units of blood, 10 million pounds of food. And over the next 100 years, we'll give between $4.5 and $6.5 billion to ministries outside the walls of our church.\" Hamilton is in the midst of a series of sermons he calls \"Unafraid: Living with Courage and Hope.\" On Sunday, his focus will be fear related to the direction of our country. He will touch on President Trump's executive action temporarily barring refugees and citizens of seven majority-Muslim countries. \"So part of it's just dealing with fear,\" Hamilton says. \"You know, our fear of President Trump, our fear of the whirlwind of activity \u2013 so if you tend to be left-of-center, there's a great deal of fear there \u2013 and I want to address that and say, 'We need to be a careful about overreacting, and being people who are stirring up fear.' \" On Trump's executive actions on immigration One of the things that struck me was that President Trump was doing exactly what he said he was going to do when he was running for office. And it was clear to me that a lot of people would feel safer because of this. I didn't personally feel safer. I think, I felt this adds to a perception of America that might further support the feelings of more radical jihadists who would say well, \"Here America's showing its true stripes.\" ... But I can understand why some people would feel that way. On the decision to talk about refugees in his sermon Well, I knew actually as of Friday night (Jan. 27) that I would be saying something, but I chose not to address it in church immediately after that on Sunday because I felt like I didn't know enough yet. And I had people who were disappointed that I didn't talk about it in church immediately after that. When you have a congregation like ours that's divided on both sides of the political spectrum ... the question is how do I continue to be pastor for all of these people? And how do I help them hear each other? Rev. Adam Hamilton And part of my thinking was, \"If every time President Trump issues an executive order that I might question on Friday, I change my sermon to preach out about it, I'm going to be preaching about President Trump every Sunday for the next four years.\" And our congregation is divided. We have some folks who are Trump supporters. We have folks who were not Trump supporters. The Trump supporters [are] like, \"Please don't talk politics every Sunday. Don't bring your personal opinions into the sermon every week.\" And other folks are like, \"Why aren't you speaking out? Why aren't you saying something?\" On what he plans for his next sermon I will also be speaking specifically about refugees, so I'll be reminding them of what the Scriptures say about the refugee, the immigrant, the alien in your midst. What does the Bible teach us about how we react to people who are in troubled situations? You know, what does it mean to be concerned for those who can't speak up for themselves? Then let's ask the question, how would Jesus define greatness? If we're really trying to be a nation that is great. The new sanctuary that's about to open at the United Methodist Church of the Resurrection's main campus has the largest single stained glass window in the world.\n                \n                    \n                    Courtesy of The United Methodist Church of the Resurrection\n                    \n                \nhide caption The new sanctuary that's about to open at the United Methodist Church of the Resurrection's main campus has the largest single stained glass window in the world. On how he feels speaking to a divided congregation When you have a congregation like ours that's divided on both sides of the political spectrum and conservative, progressive and a whole lot of people in between, the question is how do I continue to be pastor for all of these people? And how do I help them hear each other? I mean, part of the challenge in the last presidential election for Democrats is they were tone deaf to the concerns of people who were on the right, and lost an election they thought they had in the bag. And I think that's true in the congregation. That I've got to be able to understand why are some people saying, \"Finally, we've got a president who's doing something,\" while other people are fearful and saying or angry and saying, \"We have to go protest.\" I want to help both sides be able to hear the legitimate and sometimes not necessarily legitimate concerns of the other. My aim is not to see 40 percent of my congregation walk away saying, \"I don't know if I want to come back.\" And I've said to pastors across the country, I've said, \"It's easy to irritate people. It's harder to influence people.\" My hope is that I've influenced people on both sides to come together and find out, OK what's reasonable, what makes sense, and then what is in keeping with the Gospel. How does where we go, you know, when we walk out of the church and are thinking about this, influenced by our faith in Christ?",

            "article_content": "President Trump is attempting to mend his relationship with Australia after he called a refugee agreement between the two nations the \"worst deal ever.\"  ARI SHAPIRO, HOST: From Mexico to Russia to Iran, President Trump is shaking up U.S. foreign policy all over the world. The latest confrontation comes from one of the U.S.'s staunchest allies, Australia. Trump spoke yesterday by phone with Australia's prime minister. He reportedly called a refugee agreement between the nations the worst deal ever and ended the call saying it was the worst call by far he's had with any foreign leader. NPR national political correspondent Mara Liasson has more. MARA LIASSON, BYLINE: President Trump used his speech at the National Prayer Breakfast this morning to dial down the uproar over his reportedly contentious call with Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: When you hear about the tough phone calls I'm having, don't worry about it. Just don't worry about it. They're tough. We have to be tough. It's time we're going to be a little tough, folks. We're taken advantage of by every nation in the world virtually. It's not going to happen anymore. LIASSON: Toughness is Trump's stock in trade of course, but Trump's take on the call was a little different than the description shared by a much more diplomatic Prime Minister Turnbull. PRIME MINISTER MALCOLM TURNBULL: The report that the president hung up is not correct. The call ended courteously, and as far as the nature of the discussion, it was very frank and forthright. LIASSON: Later, President Trump said he didn't like the, quote, \"dumb deal\" President Obama had made with the Australians to take in about 1,200 refugees currently housed in offshore camps. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) TRUMP: For whatever reason, President Obama said that they were going to take probably well over a thousand illegal immigrants who were in prisons, and they were going to bring them in - take them into this country. And I just said, why? LIASSON: Actually, the people are in offshore detention centers, not prisons, and they are considered potential refugees, not illegal immigrants. Under the deal made by President Obama, they would be admitted to the U.S. only if they pass through the U.S. vetting process. The rhetoric sounded consistent with Trump's America-first philosophy, but significantly in this case, Trump did not say he would scrap the deal. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) TRUMP: We'll see what happens. But you know, a previous administration does something; you have to respect that. But you can also say, why are we doing this? LIASSON: On another subject, Trump began the day by praising his newly installed secretary of state, Rex Tillerson. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) TRUMP: Some people didn't like Rex because he actually got along with leaders of the world. I said, no, you have to understand. That's a good thing. That's a good thing, not a bad thing. LIASSON: Tillerson has a friendly relationship with one foreign leader in particular, Russian President Vladimir Putin, who Trump has also praised consistently. Today, the Treasury Department announced it was making what the administration called a technical adjustment to the sanctions President Obama placed on the Russian Security Agency, or FSB. The FSB is the successor to the KGB and was the main agency accused in the hacking of the 2016 elections. President Trump has suggested he might be willing to ease the sanctions on Russia in return for Russian cooperation on terrorism. And while officials from both the Trump and Obama administrations called the change a small, innocuous fix, the Russians seized the opportunity to spin this in a positive way, praising Trump for, quote, \"easing the sanctions.\" The former director of the FSB was quoted in the Russian news agency TASS as saying, without easing these sanctions, it would have been impossible to cooperate in the war on terror. This indicates that U.S. President Donald Trump has been consistent. As for U.S. president Donald Trump, when told the Russians were praising him for easing sanctions, he said, I'm not easing anything. Mara Liasson, NPR News, the White House.

            "article_content": "President Trump signs two executive orders at the Department of Defenseon  Friday \u2014 calling for the \"great rebuilding\" of the military and for \"extreme vetting\" of visa seekers from seven countries.\n                \n                    \n                    Pool/Getty Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption President Trump signs two executive orders at the Department of Defenseon  Friday \u2014 calling for the \"great rebuilding\" of the military and for \"extreme vetting\" of visa seekers from seven countries. The White House moved up the president's announcement that he was nominating Neil Gorsuch to the Supreme Court by two days, possibly to distract from the firestorm of criticism over his chaotic rollout of his refugee policy. But maybe the White House didn't have to worry. New polls show the policy may not be as unpopular as all those protests over the weekend suggested. Here are three things to consider when it comes to the politics surrounding the president's executive order: 1. What little polling there is seems to confirm the White House's confidence At the White House on Wednesday, press secretary Sean Spicer was happy to point to polls that showed support for the president's order. Spicer singled out a Rasmussen poll showing 57 percent of Americans favored a \"temporary ban on refugees from Syria.\" Rasmusssen is hardly considered a reliable and well-conducted poll. But Spicer also pointed to a Reuters poll, conducted with more traditional methods by Ipsos, which showed 66 percent of Americans agreeing with the statement \"the U.S. should limit refugees\" (which it already does). Those numbers sound like solid support for the administration's position. After all, securing the border and protecting citizens from the threat of terrorism is what most Americans expect from their government but ... 2. There's lots more in those polls Dig deeper into that Reuters poll, and you'll see something else: When you ask people if they agree or disagree with \"Trump's order,\" 49 percent agree, 41 percent oppose. That's good for the White House. But when Reuters asked should the U.S. show a preference for Christian refugees (as the president has suggested), 56 percent say no. And, in perhaps the most important finding, the country is \u2014 no surprise \u2014 very divided by party over this order: So once again, Trump has jumped both-feet-first into an issue that has deep partisan divides. This approach worked for him during the campaign, but it's not clear if it is a good governing strategy. Hundreds of people protest President Trump's travel ban at LAX airport Sunday in Los Angeles.\n                \n                    \n                    Genaro Molina/LA Times via Getty Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption Hundreds of people protest President Trump's travel ban at LAX airport Sunday in Los Angeles. 3. Political fallout Although a few Republican senators, like John McCain of Arizona and Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, agreed with national security experts who criticized the order for being wrongheaded and likely to backfire by making terrorist attacks more likely, most Republicans were either supportive or confined their criticism to the sloppy, confusing way the order was developed and implemented. Democrats, on the other hand, were uniformly appalled. They attacked the order for employing what they said was an unconstitutional religious test and for undermining democratic values of openness, tolerance and inclusion. And in a development that might be even more important than the support for the policy in the polls, there was intense and widespread public resistance to the ban. The liberal base reacted with fury. Tens of thousands of people protested at airports around the county. There was also a lot of deep resistance in Washington, too. Sally Yates, the acting attorney general, refused to defend the order, which bans people from seven Muslim-majority country, in court. She determined it was a Muslim ban. She was fired. More than 900 State Department employees signed a \"dissent cable.\" (Dissent cables have a long tradition at the State Department. There's even an award for it.) But the dissent prompted Spicer to say, \"They should either get with the program, or they can go.\" The order also seems to have further soured America's relationship with its allies. Just days after British Prime Minister Theresa May stood in the East Room with Trump, she and other European leaders blasted his plan. May called it \"divisive and wrong.\" And Wednesday night, the Washington Post reported on a tense phone call between Trump and the Australian prime minister over the ban. During the campaign, Trump's call for a Muslim ban was one of his most controversial promises. And now that he's enacting it, it's not any less divisive. Trump seems to be doubling down on division. He mocked and belittled Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer \u2014 whom he had already called a clown \u2014 for crying \"fake tears\" when Schumer choked up at an event protesting the order. \"I want to know who his acting coach was,\" Trump sneered at an unrelated event. At the time, Schumer was surrounded by distraught constituents from a diverse set of ethnicities, races and religions. Again, this kind of withering, bullying, verbal assault worked for Trump during the campaign. Will the fake-tears-of-a-clown attack help Trump govern? After all, there are many things on Trump's agenda that will need 60 votes to pass the Senate \u2014 and Schumer will have to provide some of them from Democratic ranks if Trump is to succeed. But the weekend's events have made that harder. Trump's executive order on immigration has engaged and enraged the liberal base, ensuring that Democrats in Congress will be under tremendous pressure not to cooperate with Trump on anything. The political lesson Trump appears to have learned is that division works; there's no need to adjust and it's not necessary to reach out beyond the 46 percent of voters that brought him \u2014 stunningly and improbably \u2014 to the White House.",

Children under age 14 make up nearly half of the Syrian refugees resettled in the U.S. Here's a test as to whether the Trump administration's travel ban on refugees from seven predominantly Muslim countries is truly driven by security concerns or reflects a prejudice. As I see it, the Trump ban on travel and immigration to the U.S., which is permanent for Syrians, should exempt children 10 years of age or younger. Nearly half of Syrian refugees already resettled in the U.S. are children under 14. In 2015, Republicans argued that Syrian refugees pose a security risk and hence they opposed President Obama's efforts to allow a few thousand of them into the U.S. They argued that we should learn from Europe that terrorists hide among these immigrants. In response, Democrats argued that any such limitations would violate our shared ideals as Americans, and that prolonged vetting can ensure that these refugees will not endanger us. To leapfrog this debate, I suggested that the United States should invite 25,000 Syrian families to each send one of their children under the age of 10 to the United States. Here, they would stay in foster homes until the end of the war. Their parents could reclaim them at any time and would be asked to leave instructions about whether their children should be claimed by relatives or adopted if the parents perished in the war. I took it for granted that nobody could claim that young kids pose a security risk. I pointed out that there is a precedent for this sort of action. During Operation Peter Pan, also known as Operation Pedro Pan, a large number of unaccompanied Cuban minors were brought to the United States between 1960 and 1962. The program was created by the Catholic Welfare Bureau. Initially, the children were required to have a visa to enter the United States. However, on Jan. 3, 1961, the State Department announced that Cuban minors no longer needed such visas. Several major American corporations helped finance the accommodation of these children. One of those children was Mel Martinez, who grew up to become a U.S. senator and the first Latino chairman of the Republican Party. As one who escaped Nazi Germany as a Jewish child, I also pointed to the Kindertransport program, which allowed Jewish children to leave Germany if other nations would take them. Britain agreed to shelter about 1,000 of these children from 1938 to 1940, on the assumption that the children would leave the country once the war was finished. In 2016, I wrote to 10 law firms in Washington, D.C., and asked them if they would, as part of their pro bono program, turn this idea into a draft bill. Covington & Burling responded, and their attorney did the job. He also sent the draft bill to several members of Congress, and I wrote to others. In the last hours of the 114th Congress, Rep. Mike Honda, a Democrat from California, introduced The Save the Children Act of 2016. It would have granted temporary visas to 25,000 Syrian children between the ages of 3 and 10. These visas would expire six months after our government determines that hostilities have ceased and a durable peace process has begun. The grace period will allow time for the families of the children to re-establish their households in Syria before the children return. The State Department would determine when the war is over, and the Department of Health and Human Services would ensure that the foster homes are safe for children. Bills, of course, die when a Congress expires. Rep. Honda lost his seat in last November's elections. I hence visited with the staff of some senators and met with a House member to see if they would introduce the bill into the current Congress. In the few days that have followed, no action has been taken so far. The main issue, I was told, was who will pay for the costs involved. I recently wrote to nine major charities to ask if they would foot the bill. I had done this once before, when I served as a senior adviser to the Carter administration, and sought to raise funds for taking care of the 125,000 Marielitos who suddenly arrived in Florida from Cuba in 1980. At that time, the charities were more than willing. Indeed, Catholic Charities took care of most of these immigrants. The new ban on travel suggests that waiting for Congress to act may be the wrong way to proceed. I see no reason, if the Trump administration is sincere that its concern is security, that it would not make an exception for Syrian children. Otherwise, one cannot but conclude that it is acting mainly on ideological or political grounds. Indeed, given the harsh rhetoric and flood of harsh measures, making an exemption for children would help the new Trump team to show that somewhere, under all this bluster and swagger, there is a functioning heart.

Former President Barack Obama has criticized President Trump's immigration and travel ban issued on Friday, saying through a spokesman that he is \"heartened by the level of engagement\" over the weekend in opposition to the action. \"In his final official speech as President, he spoke about the important role of citizen[s] and how all Americans have a responsibility to be the guardians of our democracy \u2014 not just during an election but every day,\" Obama spokesman Kevin Lewis said in a statement. \"Citizens exercising their Constitutional right to assemble, organize and have their voices heard by their elected officials is exactly what we expect to see when American values are at stake.\" It is the first public comment from Obama since he left office just over a week ago and departed for a vacation in Palm Springs, Calif. In his final press conference, Obama signaled he would give the new president some deference but that he wouldn't hesitate to speak up if he believed the country's \"core values may be at stake,\" including \"systematic discrimination being ratified in some fashion.\" The former president apparently felt that was in fact happening with Trump's executive order, which blocked travelers from seven countries, all of which are Muslim-majority \u2014 Iraq, Iran, Syria, Yemen, Sudan, Libya and Somalia \u2014 for 90 days. New refugee admissions are suspended for 120 days, while Syrian refugees are banned indefinitely. Trump also signaled in a weekend interview with the Christian Broadcast Network that he would give priority to Christian refugees over Muslim refugees. The administration has maintained that the sweeping actions don't constitute a Muslim ban, though. \"With regard to comparisons to President Obama's foreign policy decisions, as we've heard before, the President fundamentally disagrees with the notion of discriminating against individuals because of their faith or religion,\" the statement from Lewis added. There was confusion across the country over the implementation of the ban, which blocked some valid visa holders from entering and detained many people who had legal status and green cards. Protests sprang up at major international airports, and on Saturday night a federal judge issued a temporary stay blocking the deportation of valid visa holders. Trump has argued that his new policy is \"similar to what President Obama did in 2011 when he banned visas for refugees from Iraq for six months.\" However, as the Washington Post points out, that was in response to a specific threat after Iraqi refugees had been found to be colluding against U.S. troops. And the refugee process was slowed, not halted.",

Less than 24 hours after White House press secretary Sean Spicer had spouted numerous falsehoods about inauguration crowd size and more, Kellyanne Conway went on NBC's Meet the Press to defend him. In the process, the counselor to President Trump coined a phrase that's now destined to follow Trump throughout his presidency \u2014 \"alternative facts.\" The Trump administration's pushback on easily verifiable facts is unprecedented and shows that the Trump we saw on the campaign trail and in debates \u2014 who was freewheeling with facts and assertions and often peddled wildly exaggerated claims \u2014 had not changed once he took the oath of office. And it's only Week 1. Below we've rounded up some of the White House's assertions here that are exaggerated or just flat out false. President Trump told members of Congress during a Monday evening meeting that there were 3 million to 5 million illegal votes cast in last November's election. In an interview with ABC News's David Muir on Wednesday, he repeated those claims, saying that, \"You have people that are registered who are dead, who are illegals, who are in two states. You have people registered in two states. They're registered in a New York and a New Jersey. They vote twice. There are millions of votes, in my opinion.\" THE FACTS: This is not true, no matter how many times Trump and his surrogates repeat it. The administration has never provided proof of this claim, and the studies they have cited do not, in fact, support the claim. Even the authors of those studies have said that the studies are being misused by Trump. Analyses do show that a tiny bit of voter fraud does happen, but there is no evidence of voter fraud on this scale; that would be a scandal of \"astronomical proportions,\" as NPR's Mara Liasson said to Spicer this week. Trump also pointed to a frequently cited Pew study as evidence, which Muir pushed back on, saying correctly it showed \"no evidence of voter fraud.\" Trump said the author was \"groveling again. You know, I always talk about the reporters that grovel when they wanna write something that you wanna hear but not necessarily millions of people wanna hear or have to hear.\" THE FACTS: That Pew 2012 report does show that 2.8 million people are registered to vote in more than one state and that 24 million registration records \"are estimated to be inaccurate or no longer valid.\" But that is not evidence of fraud unless people vote in both states. And the author is not \"groveling\" when he simply pushes back because his report is taken wildly out of context and twisted into falsehoods. It is not a felony to be registered in two states \u2014 in fact, several Trump family members and advisers are registered in two states. \"No, no, you have to understand, I had a tremendous victory, one of the great victories ever. In terms of counties, I think the most ever or just about the most ever. When you look at a map it's all red.\"  \u2014 Trump to ABC, Jan. 25 THE FACTS: Trump did have an overwhelming victory, countywise. But he still lost the popular vote to Hillary Clinton by nearly 3 million votes. And his Electoral College victory ranked 46th out of 58 presidential elections. \"He won overwhelmingly with 306 electoral votes, the most since any Republican since Reagan. He's very comfortable with the depth and breadth of the support that he got from the American people and the 33 states that voted for him, the nine of 13 battleground states, the 2,600 counties. He's very, very pleased with that.\" \u2014 Spicer at Jan. 24 briefing THE FACTS: While Trump should have gotten 306 electoral votes according to the state by state results, he in fact will only end up with 304 because two electors in Texas defected when Electoral College voters cast their ballots; Clinton had several defectors, too. And Trump's victory wasn't the largest GOP win since Reagan \u2014 George H.W. Bush won 426 electoral votes in 1988. \"I got a standing ovation. In fact, they said it was the biggest standing ovation since Peyton Manning had won the Super Bowl and they said it was equal. I got a standing ovation. It lasted for a long period of time. What you do is take \u2014 take out your tape \u2014 you probably ran it live. I know when I do good speeches. I know when I do bad speeches. That speech was a total home run. They loved it.\" Trump in ABC interview \"I had a standing ovation like you wouldn't believe....They actually \u2014 they were standing from the beginning. They didn't even sit down. It was one standing ovation, the whole thing.\" Trump in interview with Fox News' Sean Hannity, Jan. 26 THE FACTS: Trump never told the CIA officers to sit at the beginning of his speech, and it's standard protocol without a directive from the president, they wouldn't have sat down, as Huffington Post's S.V. Date explains. And there were about 400 staffers at the speech. There were 71,088 fans who attended the Super Bowl last year where Manning led the Denver Broncos to the championship. So, no \u2014 it was not \"equal\" to the reception Manning got by any measure or standard, and it's not clear who \"they\" are that Trump claims made this false claim. \"I had the largest audience. I did. I had the largest audience. If you add the television, you add all the sources, the largest audience in the history of inaugurations. I did. They try and demean it so much. And when you look at pictures \u2014 I would love to show you a picture, when I was in that speech, I looked at, it was a sea of people and they want to demean it. I don't even know when that picture was taken by the way, to be honest with you. But it wasn't taken from where I was. They take a picture from the back, from the Washington Monument, a backward picture. They are so demeaning and they are so dishonest.\" Trump interview with Hannity THE FACTS: Side-by-side photos taken during the same time frame of Trump's inauguration and President Obama's inauguration clearly show a larger crowd eight years ago along with empty areas along the mall, as we debunked earlier in Spicer's weekend tirade. According to Nielsen, 30.6 million people watched Trump's inauguration \u2014 which is certainly notable \u2014 but 38 million people tuned in for President Obama's first inauguration in 2009. It's tougher to determine how many people streamed the inauguration, which has grown as a platform in eight years. But CNN reported they actually had a larger streaming audience for Obama's inauguration than Trump's. And as for the \"backward\" picture \u2014 the Obama photo was taken from the exact same angle. \"Do you know if you were a Christian in Syria it was impossible, at least very tough to get into the United States? If you were a Muslim you could come in, but if you were a Christian, it was almost impossible and the reason that was so unfair, everybody was persecuted in all fairness, but they were chopping off the heads of everybody but more so the Christians. And I thought it was very, very unfair.\" Trump's interview with the Christian Broadcasting Network, Jan. 27 THE FACTS: This Pew Research study shows that roughly the same number of Muslim refugees and Christian refugees were admitted to the U.S. in 2016. And while Christian refugees from Syria were admitted in far less numbers than Muslim refugees from the same country, they make up only about 5% of the population in Syria. As the Washington Post fact-checker finds, when looking at Iraqi refugees, Christians made up about 15% of those admitted to the U.S. even though they make up less than 1% of the Iraqi population. As Glenn Kessler of the Post writes, \"The basic fact is no one understands why there is such a disparity. The president could highlight that situation without suggesting that something nefarious is going on.\" \"Chicago is like a war zone....when President Obama was there two weeks ago making a speech, very nice speech. Two people were shot and killed during his speech. You can't have that.\" Trump in ABC interview THE FACTS: As the Chicago Tribune reports, police records show that, \"Not only did no homicides take place in Chicago during Obama's address of about an hour Jan. 10, but the official Police Department records and the Tribune's crime database show that no shootings at all occurred over that time frame.\" \"Here in Philadelphia, the murder rate has been steady \u2014 I mean just terribly increasing.\" Trump speaking to the GOP House retreat in Philadelphia on Jan. 26 THE FACTS: There were just 277 homicides in Philadelphia in 2016, down from 280 the year before, the Washington Post reports. And that is steadily down from 10 years ago when there were 391 murders in 2007. While there have been 27 murders so far in 2017 \u2014 10 more than this time last year, as the Post notes, \"that is too small a sample size to say violence is 'terribly increasing.'\" \"And the President's top priority is to retain and attract American jobs, which have already seen happening through his actions on Carrier, Sprint, General Motors and so many more.\" Spicer on Jan. 23 press briefing THE FACTS: When Trump touted back in December that he had saved 1,000 Carrier jobs from going to Mexico \u2014 a frequent campaign stump speech promise when he was in the Midwest \u2014 it was hailed as evidence that his aggressive approach to keeping manufacturing jobs would work. In fact, the Carrier deal saved less than half of the jobs there, though the broader deal did also save jobs at the United Technologies' factory elsewhere in Indiana. However, some of those Carrier jobs will eventually be lost to automation. Ultimately, about 1,000 jobs will still move to Mexico. The deal also included $7 million in tax breaks for the company, which even vocal Trump supporter Sarah Palin called \"crony capitalism.\" After Trump called out GM for making their Chevy Cruze in Mexico, the company pointed out that the main model sold in the U.S. is manufactured in Ohio. The company later announced they would move a production for parts from Mexico to Michigan, adding 450 jobs, and also moving more IT jobs back to the United States. Trump claimed credit, but GM leaders said the move had been planned for a long time. \"...buy America and hire America is at the core of the president's plan to create an economy that works for everyone...\" Spicer on Jan. 23 press briefing THE FACTS: Many of Trump's own signature pieces sold at his clubs and clothing from his daughter Ivanka's clothing line are made overseas. \"This memorandum counters through dramatic expansion of the federal workforce in recent years.\" -- White House press secretary Sean Spicer during afternoon briefing THE FACTS: There were nearly 2.8 million federal workers when Obama took office. As of December 2016, there were just a little more than 2.8 million. That's not exactly a dramatic increase, as this chart shows. The only dramatic increase happened in April 2010, when the government hired hundreds of thousands of temporary census workers, which happens every 10 years.",

            "article_content": "In the last 24 hours, President Trump has taken steps to close the door on refugees and build up the military. He has calls with foreign leaders scheduled for Saturday. We look at Trump's first week.  SCOTT SIMON, HOST: President Trump has phone calls scheduled today with several world leaders, including Vladimir Putin. In just the last 24 hours, Trump has suspended all refugees from entering the United States and suspended immigration for the next three months from seven countries that have Muslim-majority populations. He's talked about negotiating a new trade agreement with the United Kingdom and blowing up an old trade deal with Mexico, all in one week. NPR's Scott Horsley joins us. Scott, thanks for being with us. SCOTT HORSLEY, BYLINE: Good to be with you, Scott. SIMON: The president signed a couple of papers at the Pentagon last night, including this executive order that puts into practice his campaign promise of extreme vetting. What does that propose to do? HORSLEY: Well, remember, Scott, Trump's original call on the campaign trail was for a complete ban on Muslims entering the United States, and that morphed over time into extreme vetting. The order the president signed at the Pentagon is somewhere in between. He described this as a way to keep would-be terrorists from getting into the country. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: We want to ensure that we are not admitting into our country the very threats our soldiers are fighting overseas. We only want to admit those into our country who will support our country and love deeply our people. HORSLEY: This order bars entry of all refugees for 120 days. It bars entry of Syrian refugees indefinitely. It cuts by more than half the total number of refugees the United States is expected to take in this year and gives priority to Christians from the Middle East. And it closes the door for 90 days to all visitors from seven countries with largely Muslim populations - Syria, Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Yemen and Sudan. SIMON: It's getting quite a reaction. What's the range of reaction, as you've been able to tell? HORSLEY: Congressional Republicans applauded the move. The GOP chairman of the House Judiciary Committee called it a sensible pause on the entry of refugees. But the order was roundly criticized by human rights groups and Democrats on Capitol Hill. Oregon Senator Jeff Merkley said it's contrary to our founding values and a smokescreen for religious discrimination. Others said it would make the country less safe, not more. A number of critics noted this order was signed on Holocaust Remembrance Day, when the White House itself honored the victims of Nazi Germany. It bears noting, Scott, some of those Jewish victims sought refuge in the United States and were turned away, a chapter in our history that we now view with considerable shame. SIMON: Trump held his first face-to-face meeting with a foreign leader yesterday, Prime Minister May of the United Kingdom. Always talk about the special relationship between our two countries. Now, there are some similarities in their political rise, but a lot of differences, too, aren't there? HORSLEY: Yeah, the similarities are sort of superficial. You know, both countries are asserting their sovereignty - the U.S. after the November election, the U.K. after Brexit. They're both pulling back a bit from international cooperation. But while Trump was the architect of his America First campaign, Theresa May was sort of the reluctant inheritor of the Brexit vote, and she's trying to make it work. But she's far more committed to the preservation of the European Union and cooperative groups like NATO than Trump appears to be. May is also more suspicious of Russia and insisted yesterday that sanctions against Russia over its meddling in Ukraine should be preserved. Trump, however, said it's too early to say what should happen to those sanctions. SIMON: President Trump also spoke by telephone yesterday with the president of Mexico. They've kind of been barking at each other earlier in the week over Twitter. Phone call make a difference? HORSLEY: At least they sort of papered over their differences for the moment and maybe turned down the temperature on what, you're right, was threatening to become an all-out Twitter war. Both sides said yesterday the call was constructive. But, you know, Donald Trump and Enrique Pena Nieto are still on opposite sides when it comes to that wall. They scrapped a planned meeting here in Washington next week. So this is a low point in relations with our next-door neighbor. And remember, Mexico is one of the United States' biggest trading partners, even if Trump insists the U.S. is getting played. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) TRUMP: We have a trade deficit of $60 billion with Mexico. On top of that, the border is soft and weak, drugs are pouring in, and I'm not going to let that happen. HORSLEY: The administration did admit this week it's looking for other ways to pay for the border wall, including a possible tax on imports that would hit U.S. consumers, never mind the president's promise that Mexico would foot the bill.

France, the Netherlands and Germany all face national elections this year and in each case right-wing populists are in a strong position. Emboldened by Donald Trump's win and inauguration, several of Europe's top populist leaders gathered in Germany this weekend to strategize on how they might help each other in their upcoming national elections. Marine Le Pen, who heads France's far-right National Front, proved especially popular with the largely German crowd that packed a convention hall yesterday in the historic western city of Koblenz, nestled between the scenic Rhine and Mosel Rivers. She lauded the British decision last year to leave the European Union, dubbed Brexit, which she said would cause \"all of the dominoes of Europe to topple.\" She also spoke glowingly about Trump. \"2016 was the year the Anglo-Saxon world woke up,\" she said to wild applause. \"I am certain 2017 will be the year when the people of continental Europe wake up.\" Right-wing Dutch politician Geert Wilders said he's optimistic that his and Le Pen's factions, as well as the Alternative for Germany (AfD) party, will do well in elections this year. Wilders heads the Freedom Party, which according to recent polls is popular with about a quarter of Dutch voters and leading all other political factions in the Netherlands. But it's unlikely the anti-Islam MP would head any Dutch coalition government because no parties are willing to work with him. Wilders added if he and his fellow populists don't win, \"the genie won't go back into the bottle.\" \"We will be here; not only next year but many years,\" he said. There is some basis for his optimism, given the growing popularity of populist politicians among middle-class voters across Europe. They've grown increasingly frustrated with the inability of the European Union leadership to boost wages, services and jobs; to solve recurring problems with the Euro, and for failing to develop a workable refugee policy despite 1.5 million or more asylum seekers arriving there over the past few years. More recently, the 28 bloc leaders have earned more animosity from constituents over their inability to stop Muslim extremists from carrying out terror attacks. It's that dissatisfaction and fear that populist parties are capitalizing on, not unlike Trump did during his presidential campaign. \"Donald Trump has found a way out from a dead end,\" explained Frauke Petry, the 41-year-old co-chair of AfD. Trump's approach is something she and others at Saturday's conference said they hope to emulate, although Petry told NPR in a recent interview she doesn't believe her party will get enough votes in next September's elections for her to think about becoming the German chancellor. To boost their chances, European populists set aside their differences over how their countries and economies should be run, said Petry's husband, Marcus Pretzell, who is a European Parliament member and heads AfD's North Rhine Westphalia chapter. \"Realpolitik needs partners ... if we want to turn the EU on its head.\" \"What we all believe is the common people and not the political elite should be in charge again,\" Geert Wilders added. \"We want less European Union. We want more nation-state. We want to be in charge of our own law-making, our own money, our own border control. That is what we want, that is what we demand.\" But thousands of demonstrators who gathered outside the convention hall yesterday to protest the meeting dismissed the populists as Nazis and racists. \"Germany is colorful, not brown,\" they chanted, or diverse, rather than the shirt color associated with the Nazis. They later sang \"Ode to Joy,\" the Friedrich Schiller poem set to Ludwig Van Beethoven's Ninth Symphony, the music of which is the anthem of the European Union. German Vice-Chancellor Sigmar Gabriel came to see one of the protests. \"There was a sign I particularly liked: 'Whoever sleeps in a democracy, wakes up in a dictatorship,'\" he said. \"It's great that people here are resisting the notion that all of Europe is moving to the right.\" In a bid to appeal to more Germans, the AfD leaders recently have tried to distance themselves from racist and controversial comments made some of its senior members, like last week's condemnation of the Holocaust Memorial by Bjoern Hoecke, an AfD leader in Thuringia. He told supporters in Dresden on Jan. 17: \"We Germans are the only people in the world who would plant a memorial of disgrace in the heart of their capital.\"",

Last year, NPR's Ari Shapiro visited Toledo, Ohio, to talk to refugees settling there from Syria's civil war. Recently, he returned to Toledo to check in on the community. Mohammed Al Refaai is a 23-year-old butcher who fled Syria. He lives in Toledo, Ohio, with three other guys, who are also in their 20s, who decided they wouldn't mind having a refugee for a roommate. In the year and a half since he moved in, he has learned English from the Americans including the lyrics to some Top 40 hits. In return, he taught them some of his favorite Arabic pop tunes. They generally avoid talking about more difficult things. But his roommates \u2014 Doug Walton, Andrew Trumbull and Johnny Zellers \u2014 made an exception during our recent visit to Toledo. While Refaai was at work, they talked about politics and whether he will ever be reunited with his family. \"Moh,\" as they call him, won't really talk about these things, Walton says. \"This is by far the most depth we've ever gone into it, and if Moh was here, we probably wouldn't, because he doesn't like the topic,\" Walton says. Refaai's story is atypical. He was the only one of his family allowed into the United States as a refugee. His siblings and parents are still in Jordan, waiting for approvals. They've been there since the family fled Syria in 2011. Refaai is now trying to get a Green Card so if they can't come to the U.S., he can at least go visit them. The recent presidential election hit especially \u2014 and literally \u2014 close to home, Zellers says. \"We actually got a flier from Trump, and it had ... three big issues,\" he says. \"The third one was 'Stop the influx of dangerous refugees from Syria' \u2014 as ... the biggest bullet point. I was like, 'No, we want more of 'em. ... We have one, I have one in my house right now. ... I can go say hi to him!' \" The guys in this house lean conservative. They all take their Christian faith seriously. None of them voted for Trump; it was a mix of Clinton and third-party votes. They didn't even know who voted for whom until we all started talking about it. \"It is weird to have a vote in a situation that felt like we were voting for people who were helpless. Usually we vote on jobs or whatever, and so for me, I'm like, that's not a big deal. I find a job. I'll make things work, whoever gets elected \u2014 they're not going to change things that drastically,\" Trumbull says. The guys don't own a TV, so on election night, they all went into Walton's room and huddled around their phones with Refaai to watch the results come in. \"So we were all kind of together just like kind of hugging him and just kind of watching it all go down,\" Walton says. \"He definitely kind of got sad a little bit just thinking of like, OK, maybe his family may not be able to like ever come here,\" Zellers says. \"That's like the biggest hope that he's had like this past year. ... Now Trump elected it's like, oh, those chances go down like a lot.\" An \"unusual\" situation Refaii is a butcher at a new Middle Eastern supermarket and restaurant in Toledo. Mohammed Refaai, a butcher, works at a halal meat market in Toledo, Ohio.\n                \n                    \n                    Matt Ozug/NPR\n                    \n                \nhide caption Mohammed Refaai, a butcher, works at a halal meat market in Toledo, Ohio. When we met him a little over a year ago, he barely spoke any English. He had learned the terms that a butcher uses every day \u2014 chicken legs, chicken breast, steak, lamb \u2014 and that was about it. Today he looks confident. He doesn't use an interpreter when he talks to us. He video chats with his family in Jordan about once a week. He shows them the snow on the ground in Ohio, and they tell him how proud they are that he's learning English and working. \"I like it they come here, but I don't know how. I need they be safe and close to me, my family, but I can't do anything,\" he says. \"I feel bad for they not with me, but I can't do anything for help him.\" We asked the State Department about Refaai's situation. Just like a year ago, they told us they don't comment on specific cases. But veterans of refugee work say his situation is not normal. \"This situation you've described is very unusual,\" says Eric Schwartz, who ran the State Department's refugee resettlement program earlier in the Obama administration. He's now a dean at the University of Minnesota's Humphrey School of Public Affairs. He says once you're over 21 like Refaai, your case is considered on its own. But even then, grown children are rarely separated from their parents and siblings. \"And it would be very unusual for them not to be departing and coming to the United States together,\" he says. It might have just been an oversight. Schwartz says an immigration lawyer might be able to sort out what happened \u2014 but Refaai and his family don't have one. [Editor's note on Jan. 9: After this story was broadcast and published, Schwartz contacted NPR to note that hiring a lawyer is not required and that non-profit refugee advocacy organizations often make case inquiries with the Department of State at no cost to the refugees themselves.] \"This is a program that involves so many tens of thousands of individuals that sometimes mistakes or problems do arise, and the way they get fixed is somebody asks about them and somebody presses them,\" he says. Refaai fears that his window is closing as the days tick down to Trump's inauguration. The office that issues Green Cards has told him to stop calling, and that has changed the way the other guys in this house think about their future. \"Before it's just like 'Oh, Moh is here, his family will come and then I'm like, well, I'll move on with our lives \u2014 we'll all move away or get different jobs or, I don't know, and then Moh will have his family. But now it's like his family may never come,\" Zellers says. Walton says Refaai won't talk about that. \"He doesn't even want to acknowledge that could happen because thinking about this family being broken up, that like leaves him lost in a sea in a way,\" Walton says. \"But we don't know what's going to happen. So I don't know what's going to be asked of me as his brother, but I guess I'm just more aware that he may have more need for support than even he does now.\"",

            "article_content": "\"What's the difference between the FBI director and Mr. Snowden?\" Russian President Vladimir Putin asked Thursday during his yearly live call-in show, saying that he would offer political asylum to fired FBI head James Comey in the same way Russia has sheltered former NSA contractor Edward Snowden. By phrasing a question uniquely constructed for these unusual times, Putin put a new spin on the ongoing saga over Russia's tampering in the U.S. election, links between President Trump's inner circle and Russia, and allegations that the president tried to stop at least one line of inquiry. Comey recently testified that Trump fired him after asking him to end the investigation into former national security adviser Michael Flynn \u2014 a request that Comey says he memorialized in personal notes that he allowed to be leaked to the media. \"[Comey] said he'd written down his conversation with President [Trump] and handed it to the media through a friend of his,\" Putin said, according to a translation by Radio Free Europe. \"This does sound and look odd: the director of a security service making records of his talks with the supreme commander and handing it over to the media through a friend of his.\" Putin made the remark during his annual Direct Line appearance on state TV, in which he spends hours taking questions from a studio audience and from civilians across Russia.

Comparing Comey to Snowden, Putin said, \"It makes him not a security service director, but a civil activist advocating a certain belief.\" He added, \"By the way, if he faces any kind of prosecution in this regard, we will provide political asylum in Russia for him as well. He should be aware of that.\" As wide smiles broke out among the studio audience at that last remark, Putin pivoted in his chair, signaling that the question had been dealt with. This year, the Kremlin says, the call center that funnels the public's curiosity received some 2 million messages, including 1.3 million phone calls. The Kremlin says most of the calls at this year's question-and-answer session dealt with Russia's future. Many of the topics centered on wages, inflation and the economy.

Noting that the U.S. Senate has moved to impose new sanctions on Russia and to prevent the Trump administration from rolling back the sanctions without congressional approval, Putin said, \"Whatever the case, I believe this is utterly groundless.\" Putin's annual Q&A sessions are notorious for generating softball questions for the president. Late in Thursday's session, for instance, one man asked, \"What is the largest fish you have ever caught?\" Putin replied, \"20 kilograms (44 pounds),\" while also acknowledging that if someone added a bit of weight to the scale when he wasn't looking, he hadn't noticed.",

Thousands of party-goers are expected to see in the New Year at Berlin's iconic Brandenburg Gate where an official party and firework display are planned. As usual, security will be tight with road blocks and an increased police presence of some 1, 600 officers. But this year, female revelers attending the open air event will also be able to access a women-only safety zone staffed by the German Red Cross. The measures are being introduced by the police for the first time in Berlin because of concerns about sexual assaults. Anja Marx, spokesperson for the organizers of the Berlin event, says a similar set-up worked very well at Oktoberfest in Munich this year, adding that psychologists would also be available in the safety zone. Two years ago, hundreds of women in the city of Cologne reported being attacked and robbed by gangs of men while out celebrating New Year's Eve on the square in front of the famous cathedral. Police targeted migrants after many of the victims described the perpetrators as looking North African or Middle Eastern. Although hardly any prosecutions were ever made, fears soon spread about the large number of refugees and migrants who had arrived in Germany in 2015. While many Germans initially supported Angela Merkel's decision to allow asylum-seekers to come straight to Germany, the attacks on New Year's Eve in Cologne and, on a smaller scale, in other German cities, heralded a change in public mood. Consequently, Merkel's conservative bloc lost more than a million voters to the anti-Islam, populist Alternative for Germany party (AfD) in the September election. The AfD is the first right-wing party to enter the Bundestag in more than half a century. The issue of migration continues to cause tensions as Merkel struggles to build a coalition government. Following the collapse in talks with the Green party and the libertarian Free Democrats, Merkel's former coalition partner, the center-left Social Democrats (SPD), have agreed to start negotiations next week. But immigration will prove a major hurdle. The SPD are against Merkel's conservative bloc's proposal to introduce an annual upper limit on asylum-seekers. Both the SPD and Merkel's Christian Democrats worry that a repeat of attacks on the scale of those that happened in Cologne two years ago could politically benefit the right-wing AfD party. Nonetheless, the move to set up a safety zone for female party-goers in Berlin is not welcomed by all, even from within Merkel's own party. Antonia Niecke, chairperson of the Christian Democrats' youth wing in Hamburg, argues that safety zones for women assume that sexual assault is a given and, knowing that, questions how women can really be expected to enjoy New Year's celebrations. Criticism has also come from the German police, despite the fact that the safety zone has been set up by the capital's own police force. Rainer Wendt, head of Germany's police union, told a regional paper on Saturday that the apparent need for safety zones implies that public space is unsafe, indicating \"the end of equality, freedom of movement and freedom of choice.\" Wendt says women should feel safe everywhere.",

            "article_content": "German chancellor Angela Merkel has been a leading figure in Europe and on the world stage but critics say her party's poor showing in the recent German elections has occupied her attention.  DAVID GREENE, HOST: So in the span of two months, German Chancellor Angela Merkel has gone from being Forbes magazine's most powerful woman in the world to a leader largely absent from the international stage. She's in trouble because three months after elections in Germany, Merkel has not been able to form a new government. NPR's Soraya Sarhaddi Nelson reports from Berlin that this crisis is not likely to end anytime soon. SORAYA SARHADDI NELSON, BYLINE: Angela Merkel is reluctant to commit Germany to anything these days. Take her recent news conference in Brussels with French President Emmanuel Macron. The French leader wants to bring EU member states closer politically and economically, and desperately needs Germany's support for his plans. But the German chancellor couldn't give it to him. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) CHANCELLOR ANGELA MERKEL: (Speaking German). NELSON: Merkel told reporters, there will be a joint vision for EU reforms, but that it will take time. She said the next step in the discussion won't come before next March and possibly June. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) MERKEL: (Speaking German). NELSON: Back in Berlin, Merkel explains her reasons. She said she chose those dates because by then she hopes to be heading a new government. She said any new direction in Germany's foreign policy decisions would need input from her new governing partner. She needs that partner because her conservatives did not win an outright majority in the parliamentary elections. That's left Germany in political limbo and Merkel adding another milestone to her accomplishments. She's the chancellor who has taken the longest to form a new German government. JOSEF JANNING: On the European level, she's clearly distracted, and she's also constrained in what she can do. NELSON: Josef Janning heads the Berlin office of the European Council on Foreign Relations. JANNING: That is weakening Germany's role in Europe, even though Merkel, in the circle of the European Council, is as respected and as experienced as she used to be. But she doesn't have the largest member state and its possibilities in hand at this point in time. NELSON: Her weakness has emboldened her detractors within the European Union. They are trampling on key policies she's led on, like a mandate to redistribute refugees among bloc states to ease the pressure on Greece and Italy, where most asylum-seekers first enter Europe. Janning says other programs could stall as well, like the EU's new joint security defense pact. Key talks on EU financing for the next seven years are also scheduled for 2018. JANNING: These negotiations will probably be the toughest budget negotiations that we have ever seen, and with Germany not active, it's going to be very odd because a lot of the debate will depend on where Germany wants to go. NELSON: For now Merkel has no choice but to focus her undivided attention on ending the political crisis at home. Talks resume in the new year between her conservatives and the center-left Social Democrats, and they are, at best, lukewarm about forming a new government with Merkel.

            "article_content": "German Chancellor Angela Merkel now faces the choice of forming a minority government or calling new elections. Either way, the failure is a setback to Merkel's leadership.  STEVE INSKEEP, HOST: Germany's chancellor, Angela Merkel, is still struggling to form a government. Her party won elections in September. That's the good news for her. The bad news is, she needs to form a coalition with other parties and has failed. Now she and others have been urged to keep trying. NPR's Soraya Sarhaddi Nelson has been traveling around Germany, talking with voters. We find her in a shopping mall. And Soraya, let's start with the political news here. How bad is this? SORAYA SARHADDI NELSON, BYLINE: Oh, it's pretty bad. I mean, certainly, the lack of a coalition government would be unprecedented in post-war German history. So what ended up happening last night is that one of the four parties Merkel needs to form a government walked out. The issue that's been stymieing everybody for weeks has been climate change to some extent, but refugees, for sure, is the main issue. INSKEEP: Oh, let's talk about this. Germany, of course, has led in a great many refugees from North Africa and the Middle East. Merkel has allowed that but has been criticized. What is it that people want done or her critics want done? NELSON: Well, there's a real concern about, how do you accommodate all these people? There are still very many of them who haven't been processed. There've been attacks here in Germany carried out by some asylum seekers, the largest-scale one being the Christmas market attack in Berlin last December. And people just want - they're concerned that Germany can handle this. And certainly, that's the mandate that the voters came back with in September. It's why Merkel's party and her Bavarian ally did not do as well, why the right-wing populace did. And so the discussion that ended up happening over these past four weeks centered a lot on, what should be done with refugees? And so they just couldn't come to any kind of consensus, at least before last night. INSKEEP: OK, so right-wing populists didn't do that well in the elections but well enough to scramble the results, make it difficult to get a majority coalition. Who could force the parties to work together? NELSON: Well, interestingly enough, it's the president of Germany. This is mostly a ceremonial post, and now he really holds the future of Germany in his hands. And basically, he can call elections. He can decide whether or not Chancellor Merkel can actually lead a minority government in parliament. But it was interesting - today, he just had harsh words for the parties that were in the negotiations that faltered. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) PRESIDENT FRANK-WALTER STEINMEIER: (Speaking German). NELSON: Steinmeier says that the parties that were involved in these negotiations asked for the responsibility on September 24 during the elections to form a government and that they have no right to be handing this back to the voters now. INSKEEP: Soraya, it sounds very interesting where you are. Will you describe what you've been hearing in that shopping mall? NELSON: Yes. Let me just briefly describe where I am first in Lower Saxony. This is a town called Salzgitter. This is northwestern Germany, and it's the first town in Germany to put a ban on refugees. No more refugees are allowed to move in here because they felt that in a town of 106,000 people that 5,700 refugees were just too many. And so we've been talking to people here. And it's - it doesn't look super diverse when you're standing in the mall. I would say Berlin is far more diverse. But people here - they're very disappointed in the fact that the talks broke down. We didn't hear a whole lot of people here interested in going to the ballot box again. But they say they understand why the refugee issue is the thing that ended up costing this coalition because they feel this is an issue that the government and that the mainstream parties just have not dealt with. INSKEEP: Is there support for Angela Merkel even in that place where there is resistance to refugees? NELSON: Yes, there is. I mean, this is a woman who's been chancellor for 12 years, and there is really no replacement in sight. And the feeling is that she is very methodical in her approach, very rational and reasonable. And so there - I think there is still hope that maybe the mainstream parties pull this out, but they are very angry and disappointed today. INSKEEP: NPR's Soraya Sarhaddi Nelson reporting from Germany - thanks very much. NELSON: You're welcome, Steve. Copyright \u00a9 2017 NPR.  All rights reserved.

The crowd is awash in Catalan independence flags and signs reading \"free political prisoners.\" Demonstrators clogged plazas and blocked roadways across Catalonia on Wednesday, calling on Spain's central government to sanction the region's bid for independence and release the eight politicians who were arrested for pursuing it. The one-day, general strike ground traffic to a halt and caused train cancellations in Barcelona and other Catalan cities. Yet even as protesters chanted in the square outside Barcelona's parliament building, halfway across the country in Madrid, the Constitutional Court was formally annulling the Catalan parliament's declaration of independence. That declaration last month had already drawn the federal government's swift, sweeping decision to dissolve the previously semi-autonomous region's government. And the court's move Wednesday was not unexpected: In early September, weeks before Catalans even went to the polls (amid chaotic circumstances) to vote on whether to secede, the same court had suspended the regional law that enabled the independence referendum in the first place. Though seemingly foreordained, the Madrid court's decision still only deepened the standoff. That was nowhere more evident than a six-hour drive away in Barcelona where law enforcement sought to dislodge demonstrators intent on causing gridlock.

Reporting from Barcelona for NPR's Newscast unit, Lucia Benavides noted that the blockades had left much of the normally bustling city uncharacteristically quiet \u2014 while elsewhere, in the areas around government buildings, protesters raised cacophonous chants for the release of the lawmakers in custody, whom they called \"political prisoners.\" Those eight lawmakers have been jailed during a sedition and rebellion investigation against them. They face up to 30 years in prison if tried and convicted. As part of a general strike Wednesday, protesters block a major highway in Borrassa, a municipality in Catalonia.

The scene was just one of several miles-long traffic jams caused by demonstrators gathering on the region's streets and railways. Meanwhile, Catalan President Carles Puigdemont and several fellow separatist politicians remain in Belgium, where they fled after the central government sacked regional lawmakers in retaliation for the independence declaration. They were briefly jailed there, before being released on the condition that they appear at all future court hearings and do not leave the country without permission. \"Free without needing bail,\" Carles Puigdemont tweeted in Catalan on Monday. \"Our thoughts are with our colleagues unjustly imprisoned by a state far from democratic principles.\" En llibertat i sense fian\u00e7a. El nostre pensament \u00e9s per als companys injustament empresonats per un Estat allunyat d la pr\u00e0ctica democr\u00e0tica Puigdemont, who remains wanted by Spain for alleged crimes including rebellion and sedition, has said he and the other politicians do not intend to seek political asylum in Belgium, and Belgian Prime Minister Charles Michel said Wednesday that his government does not intend to intervene in the dispute. \"It is a question of democracy, the rule of law,\" Michel told the Belgian parliament, according to a Politico translation. \"I will see that there is no interference, [that] the independence of justice and the separation of powers [is ensured.]\" Still, Teri Schultz reports for NPR that \"it could take as long as three more months\" before the politicians are sent back. As the fate of the Catalan leaders follows its twists and turns, Spanish Foreign Minister Alfonso Dastis appeared to signal little bit of leeway developing in Madrid's stance on secession, which has toed a hard line so far. \"We have created a committee in parliament to explore the possibility of amending the constitution to be able to accommodate better the aspirations of some of the Catalan people,\" Dastis told the BBC on Wednesday. \"We acknowledge there is a political situation that deserves to be looked at but, in any case, it's clear that the decision will be taken, will have to be taken by all Spaniards.\" Snap elections to refill the region's leadership positions have been scheduled for Dec. 21.",

Updated at 2:37 p.m. ET Ousted Catalan leader Carles Puigdemont says he and several of his fellow politicians might have fled Spain for Belgium, but they have no intention of seeking political asylum there. Rather, he told a news conference in Brussels on Tuesday, they had \"decided to err on the side of caution\" by leaving the tumult in Catalonia. The statement comes after the region formally declared independence Friday, then saw Spain retaliate by taking over direct rule and announcing sedition charges against Catalan leaders. \"I did this to avoid the threats that I was receiving,\" Puigdemont told reporters through an interpreter. \"The five ministers I'm with have no protection. We also wanted to avoid any confrontation that may possibly have occurred had we stayed in Barcelona.\" Just hours after the news conference, a Spanish judge ordered the separatist leader and members of his deposed administration to testify before the court. They have been called to appear Thursday to speak on the charges lodged against them by Spain's attorney general, which include rebellion and embezzlement and carry a possible sentence of 30 years in prison. As of this writing, the Catalan politicians have not publicly responded to the summons. But before it was issued, Puigdemont had told reporters that \"you have to abide by the law \u2014 and we won't shy away from our responsibilities.\" But he added that \"we do need guarantees\" in order to return to Spain. The volley of statements Tuesday follows a day filled with confusion in Catalonia. As some Catalan officials defied Madrid's order dissolving the regional government by going to work, and later were summarily removed \u2014 a photo was posted on Puigdemont's Instagram, apparently taken from his office. Later in the day, it was revealed he and several other Catalan politicians had fled Spain for Belgium. Bon dia \ud83d\ude0a A post shared by Carles Puigdemont (@carlespuigdemont) on Oct 29, 2017 at 11:39pm PDT As NPR's Lauren Frayer notes, that move did not sit particularly well with Spanish officials \u2014 or with some Catalan independence activists, either. In Lauren's words, a Catalan schoolteacher named Laia Llobet told her that Puigdemont \"just up and left at the most important moment\": \"She wants Puigdemont to come back and run in elections set for Dec. 21. Two civic leaders of the Catalan independence movement have already been arrested and charged with sedition \u2014 Llobet says it's unfair for Puigdemont to leave them behind languishing in jail.\" Puigdemont asserted they fled not to pursue Belgian protection, but rather to \"act with freedom and security.\" Referring to the independence referendum on Oct. 1, when clashes broke out between Spanish police and Catalans attempting to go to the polls, Puigdemont said he had seen \"what the reaction of the federal government was and how violent they were with our people.\" \"I wanted to avoid this at all costs,\" he added. \"I wanted to avoid confrontation or any possible clashes.\" But he also added that he would accept the results of those Dec. 21 elections called by the central Spanish government, under one important condition: \"I want a clear commitment from the state. Will the state respect the results that could give separatist forces a majority?\"",

They will both take seats in the country's Parliament later this month.\n                \n                    \n                    John Macdougall/AFP/Getty Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption Alexander Gauland, 76, and Alice Weidel, 38, are the leaders of the populist, anti-immigrant Alternative for Germany party. They will both take seats in the country's Parliament later this month. When Germany's Parliament convenes later this month, members of a far-right party will take seats for the first time since the 1950s. The Alternative for Germany (AfD) came in third in last month's parliamentary elections and promises to raise its voice in the opposition. Alice Weidel and Alexander Gauland took the reins of the populist, anti-immigrant party after internal disputes led to the resignation of former leader Frauke Petry, who has since vowed to form her own party. Weidel and Gauland are separated in age by nearly four decades and come from markedly different backgrounds, but analysts say they make an effective pair. Alice Weidel: 'For my children' Weidel, 38, a former investment banker with Goldman Sachs, joined the AfD in 2013 and was elected as its co-lead candidate in April. Her party favors xenophobic positions, but Weidel has lived abroad and speaks conversational Mandarin. The AfD manifesto favors a \"traditional family\" having \"a father, mother and children\"; Weidel is openly lesbian and is raising two children with her partner Sarah Bossard, a Switzerland-based film producer. When asked about her motivation for joining the AfD, Weidel told the Frankfurter Allgemeine newspaper, \"I do not want to be reproached later for having not tried. I do it as well for my children.\" Weidel studied business, earning a Ph.D. summa cum laude at the University of Bayreuth, and wrote her dissertation about the retirement system of China. She studied on a prestigious academic fellowship and worked at the Bank of China. Toralf Staud, a German journalist who closely follows right-wing extremism, is not surprised by incongruities between Weidel's private life and her political ideology. \"Look at Trump,\" he says. \"Grabbing women's genitals and being proud of it is not the core character of a conservative. When other matters are more influential for the voting decision, people look beyond the character deficits and programmatic contradictions.\" Earlier this year, reports circulated that a Syrian asylum seeker was working illegally in Weidel's family home in Switzerland. In a statement, Weidel explained she had befriended a Syrian refugee family more than two years earlier. She emphasized that the family was Christian and said they had been persecuted by the Islamic State. After helping them with the challenges of being new in a foreign country \u2014 paperwork, translation, finding a place to live \u2014 she said the Syrian family wanted to give something back and had volunteered to help around the house. Alexander Gauland: 'The CDU has left me' The 76-year-old Gauland, born and raised in the former East Germany, has been in politics most of his life. A lawyer by training, he spent 40 years on the center-right as a member of the Christian Democratic Union (CDU), led now by Chancellor Angela Merkel. He is renowned as a speechwriter and held various roles at the state level. Gauland fled East Germany in 1959 to study in the West. When a German newspaper asked if this made him a refugee, he responded: \"To call me a refugee is an impudence. I was not a refugee, I was a German in Germany.\" From 1991 to 2005, Gauland \u2014 who's known for wearing ties with dog patterns \u2014 was one of the publishers of a regional newspaper in Potsdam. His media experience has been helpful ever since: He understands how to provoke, how to push boundaries and break taboos. He provoked outrage last month when he said Germans should be \"proud of the achievements of the German soldiers in two world wars.\" In 2013, Gauland turned his back on the CDU because he had trouble identifying with its political re-positioning toward the left. Speaking of his decision to join the AfD, Gauland said, \"The CDU has left me, not the other way round.\" He has attacked it ever since. He promised after the election that he would \"hunt Frau Merkel ... and we will reclaim our country and our people.\" According to analysis of last month's election results, a million AfD voters were former CDU supporters. Some argue Gauland may be using the AfD as a populist instrument to try and push the CDU back to more conservative positions. But others believe his words suggest he's fully embraced the AfD. Recently, Gauland proposed to \"dispose of\" Aydan Ozoguz, Germany's commissioner for immigration, refugees and integration, by sending her to Turkey. And last year, speaking of refugees, he said: \"We have to endure the cruel images and keep the borders closed. We cannot be blackmailed by the eyes of kids.\" Gauland's daughter, Dorothea Gauland, works as a pastor and has distanced herself from her father's rhetoric. She welcomed an Eritrean refugee into her parish in Ruesselsheim, near Mainz, and has called her father's statements about immigrants and closing borders \"terrible.\" 'Both quite fit with the AfD' Peter Matuschek, director of political opinion research at Germany's Forsa polling firm, says that AfD supporters are not primarily motivated by individual leaders, but by ideology. \"This is what separates them from the supporters of all other parties,\" Matuschek says. \"This is why the biography of Ms. Weidel has no influence on the degree of support for the AfD.\" The AfD's internal disputes over leadership have not harmed the party's support either, he says. Hendrik Traeger, a political scientist at the University of Leipzig who has closely followed developments in the AfD, believes the differences between Gauland and Weidel work to the party's advantage. \"Gauland and Weidel are very different personalities, but both quite fit with the AfD,\" he says. \"They possibly attracted different segments of voters.\" Simon Schuetz, a political reporter for the German daily Bild, is an Arthur F. Burns Fellow.",

The election results are a major shock for Germany's political establishment.  ROBERT SIEGEL, HOST: Angela Merkel is German chancellor for the fourth time. Her party won the most votes in yesterday's parliamentary election. But support from Merkel's Christian Democrats was at its lowest level since World War II. AILSA CHANG, HOST: And a right-wing, anti-migrant party stormed into the German Parliament for the first time. It's called the Alternative for Germany. Its campaign focused directly on Merkel and her migration policies. Now it's expected to take more than 90 seats. NPR's Soraya Sarhaddi Nelson reports from Berlin. (APPLAUSE) SORAYA SARHADDI NELSON, BYLINE: Here in Berlin, campaign workers for Alternative for Germany, or AFD, celebrated their party's better-than-expected returns last night. They did especially well in the former East Germany, where Merkel grew up and has her electoral district. While exit polls suggest AFD benefited from a protest vote, Alexander Gauland, who is one of the party's newly elected MPs, is making the most of it. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) ALEXANDER GAULAND: (Speaking German). NELSON: One of the first things he promised to do was to, quote, \"hunt down Mrs. Merkel and whoever else stands in our way and take back our country and people.\" (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) GAULAND: (Speaking German). (APPLAUSE) NELSON: The party says its goal is to craft a sensible immigration policy that protects German jobs and benefits, as well as pull Germany out of the eurozone so that German taxpayers stop paying for bailouts of debt-ridden countries. The new MPs also pledged to launch a parliamentary inquiry into Merkel and her refugee policy, which led to more than a million asylum seekers coming to Germany in recent years. But AFD's many critics say what the party is really about is deep-rooted xenophobia, anti-Semitism and a nationalist agenda that threatens to tear Germany apart in flight. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN: (Speaking German). UNIDENTIFIED MAN #1: (Speaking German). NELSON: During a televised debate last night, mainstream politicians criticized Gauland's recent speech, which called on Germans to be proud of what their soldiers achieved during the first and second world wars. The fourth term was always likely to be a difficult one for Merkel, and the presence of AFD in Parliament will only make that worse. But there are limits to what AFD can accomplish given that none of the other six parties that won seats in the new German Parliament are willing to work with it. Another problem for the AFD is strife within the party. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) FRAUKE PETRY: (Speaking German). NELSON: Co-chair Frauke Petry walked out on a news conference she and her party's new MPs held this morning, saying she had no interest in serving in Parliament with her stunned colleagues. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) UNIDENTIFIED MAN #2: (Speaking German). NELSON: Petry later admitted on German public television that she had planned the dramatic exit. She hinted she would start her own version of the party without the extremist rhetoric, although she's been accused of that herself in the past. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) PETRY: (Speaking German). NELSON: Petry said she wants, quote, \"constructive politics\" and that Germany needs a new beginning, which she predicts her new party will provide four years from now. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) CHANCELLOR ANGELA MERKEL: (Speaking German). NELSON: Merkel, meanwhile, told reporters she is determined to win back the million voters she lost to AFD and promised, quote, \"hard confrontations\" with the right-wing party in the Parliament.

Chancellor Angela Merkel may have won Germany's national election on Sunday, but her Christian Democratic Union/Christian Social Union faction only won a third of the vote, its poorest showing since 1949. In another blow to the incumbent leader, German voters also are sending right-wing nationalists to the parliament or Bundestag for the first time in 60 years. Exit polls suggest that decision was more of a protest vote than a German shift to the right. But the anti-Muslim, anti-immigrant Alternative for Germany (AfD), which Merkel said nabbed 1 million of her voters, was jubilant about its better-than-expected returns of 12.6 percent across Germany, where an estimated 76 percent of registered voters turned out. In eastern Germany, where Merkel grew up, the right-wing nationalist party did even better, earning 21.5 percent of the votes. At a post-election party, Alexander Gauland, one of the party's top leaders and a new member of Parliament, vowed to hunt down Merkel and anyone else who stands in the way of AfD's agenda. What that agenda entails is a matter of some debate. AfD spokespeople claim their goal is a sensible immigration policy and getting Germany out of the Eurozone so that German taxpayers stop paying for bailouts of other European countries that use the currency. Another AfD leader and new member of Parliament, Alice Weidel, has also vowed to start a parliamentary inquiry into Merkel and her refugee policy. But the right-wing group's many critics \u2013 including every other party headed to the Bundestag \u2013 accuse AfD of deep-rooted xenophobia, anti-Semitism and having a nationalist agenda that threatens to tear Germany apart. At a televised debate in Berlin on Sunday night, those parties pointed out Gauland's speech earlier this month, when he called on Germans to be proud of what their soldiers achieved during the First and Second World Wars. During the televised debate, Merkel vowed there would be \"hard confrontations\" between her faction and the AfD in Parliament. And within the AfD on Monday, internal squabbles erupted as well, when one of its co-chairs, Frauke Petry, walked out on an AfD press conference after saying she had no interest in serving in Parliament with the rest of her party's ticket. She suggested she would start her own version of the party, but without the extremist rhetoric. \"I'm happy we won because for 4 1/2 years, we worked hard to get into the Parliament,\" she told German Public Television ARD. \"But unfortunately, our party frightens too many voters. We have in Germany an estimated 30 percent of voters who want sensible, conservative policies and can't find anyone to provide them, so I am available to fulfill that role.\" Merkel says a top task on her agenda is to win back AfD voters to her conservative faction. But she first must partner with one or more of the other parties in the next Parliament to begin her new term as chancellor. That will be a difficult negotiation that Merkel says could last until Christmas \u2014 or longer. Martin Schulz, the leader of Merkel's most recent coalition partner, the Social Democrats, said in no uncertain terms that it won't be his party. His SPD ran on a social justice platform aimed at easing income disparity and improving welfare benefits and education, but it didn't persuade voters. The party had its poorest showing in many decades. During the TV debate on Sunday night, Schulz blamed the loss on Merkel. \"This grand coalition was voted out,\" he said. \"It's clear the people don't want it and the role that's been assigned us is to be the opposition.\" Merkel fired back she was \"sad the good work we did in the grand coalition is now being characterized this way.\" She had campaigned on her record as a highly respected leader not only in Germany, but also internationally. She highlighted the country's record-low unemployment and strong economic growth under her leadership. But German unhappiness over the long-time leader's refugee policy \u2014 which allowed more than a million asylum seekers into the country since 2015 \u2014 was something from which Merkel never fully recovered. \"Merkel has become a very polarizing figure, something she never envisioned for herself, never saw happening,\" said Merkel biographer Stefan Kornelius, the foreign editor of Germany's daily Sueddeutsche Zeitung. \"As much as she pushed to the center on the refugee issue and brought in the left part of electoral voters in her camp,\" he said, she lost voters to the right of the spectrum. As early as this week, Merkel's faction will start talks with two possible coalition partners: The pro-environmental Green party and the business-friendly Free Democratic Party, which Merkel said won 1.3 million voters from her faction. The Green party and Free Democrats are hardly natural allies. Merkel says under no circumstances will she ask the other two winners \u2014 the Left Party, which is the successor to the East German communists, and the AfD \u2014 to be in her government. But even though Merkel and other mainstream politicians in Germany want to isolate AfD, they won't be able to ignore the party completely. The right-wing party last year helped shift the debate on asylum seekers from one over integration into German society to one focused on increasing and speeding up deportations. There is one thing Merkel and AfD more or less agree on: the need to engage the Trump administration. The right-wing nationalists have said they see a kindred spirit in President Trump, even if AfD's lead candidate Alice Weidel criticized his Twitter habit at a recent news conference Merkel, during her only televised debate during the campaign, said Germany must work with the U.S. on issues like ISIS and Afghanistan and that despite their differences on diplomacy, trade and climate change, she will do her best to find common ground with the American leader.",

Most voters here have been loyal to Merkel and admire her, says Benjamin Fischer of the regional paper Ostsee-Zeitung. BENJAMIN FISCHER: (Speaking German). NELSON: He says residents are proud the most powerful woman in Germany happens to be their MP. Fischer says they are also drawn to the chancellor's down-to-earth personality and enthusiasm, not only for politics but everyday topics like cooking. But the editor says voters here in Stralsund turned on the chancellor over her decision to allow more than a million mostly Muslim asylum-seekers into Germany since 2015. Most Eastern German voters are frustrated by lingering economic disparity with their Western German counterparts and fear the situation will worsen because of the refugees. It's a fear stoked by the right-wing populist Alternative for Germany, or AfD. The party scored an embarrassing victory over Merkel's Christian Democrats in elections last year in the German state that is home to her electoral district. Stralsund was the first German town where Merkel came face to face with AfD protesters. (SOUNDBITE OF PROTEST) UNIDENTIFIED PROTESTERS: (Chanting in German). NELSON: They shouted, \"Merkel must go\" as she arrived for a meeting at the city hall in late February 2016. Fischer says among the protesters was former radio presenter Leif-Erik Holm, who is now challenging the chancellor for her parliamentary seat. LEIF-ERIK HOLM: (Speaking German). NELSON: Holm says he is confident he can win here, even if Merkel's Christian Democrats, or CDU, are long established and far better-financed here. HOLM: (Speaking German). NELSON: He says Merkel's refugee policy makes her vulnerable, even though fewer asylum-seekers are coming to Germany these days and few refugees ever settled in Stralsund. Holm says voters see TV reports on asylum-seekers committing crimes in other parts of Germany, like the terror attack in Berlin last Christmas, or forming what he describes as parallel societies that threaten German culture and existence. Ann Christin von Allwoerden is a policewoman and Stralsund's CDU representative in the Mecklenburg-West Pomerania state legislature. She says the perceived threat by refugees, however exaggerated, hurts her and other Christian Democrats. ANN CHRISTIN VON ALLWOERDEN: (Speaking German). NELSON: The state lawmaker says she won by only 56 votes. But she doesn't blame Merkel for the CDU's poor showing, saying she supports her refugee policy as just and humane. Most Stralsund residents NPR spoke to were reluctant to share their views on Merkel or how they plan to vote in parliamentary elections on September 24. Surveys have shown some drop in support for the AfD populace in recent months. And another trend that benefits Merkel is that her party tends to do better in national elections than local ones here.

The measure was approved by the government on Tuesday. Austria became the latest European country to ban the full-face veil on Tuesday, with the legislation supported by both of the country's ruling parties. \"Starting in October, police will be charging fines from people who wear clothes that obstruct their facial features,\" Deutsche Welle reports. \"The 150-euro ($166) fine would also apply to women wearing burqas and niqabs at universities, courts, or in public transport.\" France, Belgium, the Netherlands and Bulgaria have already banned or partially banned wearing a burqa or niqab. Germany and Norway are also working on bans. \"The ban on the full-face veil is seen above all as a symbolic measure designed to avert pressure from the anti-immigration Freedom party,\" reports the Guardian. \"Only between 100 and 150 women are estimated to wear the full-face veil in Austria.\" The ban is part of a larger \"integration law\" that was assembled by Austria's two major parties, the Social Democratic party and the center-right Austrian People's Party. The policies are seen as an effort to avoid a collapse of the coalition government, which would trigger snap elections. The government is under pressure from the far-right Freedom Party, which said that the law did not go far enough. The new package of laws is intended to create \"better framework conditions for this long and difficult road to integration,\" said Austrian Foreign Minister Sebastian Kurz in a March press release. It creates a number of rules and regulations for people who want to settle in Austria, including a 12-month \"integration school\" with lessons in German language and Austrian values. Asylum seekers will also be expected to do unpaid public work to prepare them for the job market, Deutche Welle reports. \"This is meant to ensure long-term integration into the labour market,\" said the foreign ministry's press release. Migrants who refuse to take part in the courses would see their social welfare benefits cut, reports Deutsche Welle. In February, thousands of people marched in Vienna in a rally organized by Muslim groups, protesting the proposed legislation. In a press release that month, Kurz referred to full-body veils and Salafist literature distribution as \"symbols of a counter-society.\" Germany's lower house, the Bundestag, approved a similar draft law last month that would prohibit wearing the full-face veil at work for civil servants, judges and soldiers. German Chancellor Angela Merkel called for a ban on full-face veils \"wherever legally possible.\" She faces an election in September, and her party has been losing some support to the anti-immigrant Alternative for Germany party, reports Deutsche Welle. In March, the EU's highest court ruled that a Muslim woman who was fired in Belgium over wanting to wear an Islamic headscarf at her job did not suffer from direct discrimination, because her employer had a general rule against religious or political displays. The veil bans join a long history of regulating and legislating women's clothing. France became the first European country to ban the full-face veil in 2011. Last summer the country introduced a ban on the \"burkini\"; the ban was enforced by mayors on the French Riviera until it was overturned by France's top administrative court.",

            "article_content": "Germany's interior minister proposed establishing 10 principles to preserve German identity at a time of mass migration. He said asylum seekers and others should adapt to German culture or get out.  STEVE INSKEEP, HOST: Germany's interior minister said this week it is time for Germans to embrace their roots. The interior minister said asylum seekers and other immigrants should adapt to German culture or get out. He's not the only politician talking this way. The lower house of Germany's parliament last week passed a partial ban on the burka, face coverings worn by some Muslim women in public. NPR's Soraya Sarhaddi Nelson is covering this story from Berlin. Hi, Soraya. SORAYA SARHADDI NELSON, BYLINE: Good morning, Steve. INSKEEP: OK, embrace their roots. What does the interior minister mean by that exactly? NELSON: Well, Interior Minister Thomas de Maiziere laid this out in 10 theses, if you will, in the Bild am Sonntag newspaper. He tried explaining, you know, Germany is an open society. We show our face. We shake hands. We are not the burka. And the burka that he's referring to is this all-encompassing covering that some Muslims wear to hide their bodies and faces. So basically, what he was saying is that people should embrace their German roots, embrace the German language, embrace German culture and that immigrants who come to Germany and don't do so aren't going to fit in well there and should, you know, pretty much leave. I mean, he doesn't spell it out in very direct terms, but that's certainly the implication. INSKEEP: And when he says 10 theses, it makes me think of Martin Luther, of all things, \"The 95 Theses,\" this protest against the direction of events. He's trying to make a strong statement here is what he's doing. NELSON: He certainly is. And it is the 500th anniversary of those theses. But pretty much what he's doing here, though, contradicts what his - what the chancellor, who's his boss, has been saying about Islam being a part of Germany, especially because he's referring to the burka. The other thing that he talks about, which created some controversy here, is that he's talking about that Germans should embrace enlightened patriotism. In other words, that they should love their country but not hate others. And he tries to differentiate that from German nationalism, which he says is dead. INSKEEP: Can I just mention for the American audience that Germany's in the middle of an election campaign. Could this have anything to do with the interior minister raising this subject at this time? NELSON: Well, certainly that's what his critics say, both on the right and the left. The voters that he might be appealing to with this sort of thing are ones that have been going to the populist Alternative for Germany party. And their co-chair tweeted that, yes, this is an election ploy in their eyes. But there's also concern on the part of people who are concerned about this, you know, the critics, that are saying that it's the German constitution that should dominate, not the German culture when it comes to how Germany conducts itself and what people who come here should be embracing. INSKEEP: OK, so the interior minister is laying out these theses, which are just ideas. It's a political platform. But we mentioned that the legislature is also talking about a law. What would the burka ban really do in practical terms? NELSON: It's a pretty watered-down version of what was initially planned because the fear is that it wouldn't stand up in court. So what this amounts to, what the lower house of parliament has passed, would apply to Germans or anybody working within the German government or military or schools who wears a full or partial face veil. And reporters who've looked into that here say that amounts to zero employees. What it does do that's interesting, though, if it's passed is it gives authorities power, which they don't have now, to be able to demand that women whose faces are covered, that they have to lift their veil so that their appearance can be checked against their IDs. So if that happens, Germany will be joining a growing number of European countries with a partial or full ban on face veils. INSKEEP: OK, at least symbolically important. Soraya, thanks very much, as always. NELSON: You're welcome, Steve. INSKEEP: That's NPR's Soraya Sarhaddi Nelson in Berlin. Copyright \u00a9 2017 NPR.  All rights reserved.

Frauke Petry is a paradox. The petite 41-year-old German chemist with a pixie cut is well known for being tough as nails, chewing out journalists and wresting control of the nationalist Alternative for Germany (AfD) political party a couple of years after it was founded. But Petry looked a little lost as the AfD hosted last weekend's summit of Europe's populist stars next to the Rhine River in Koblenz. She shifted awkwardly onstage next to charismatic National Front leader Marine Le Pen, her far-right ally from France, who posed with Dutch isolationist phenomenon Geert Wilders as he snapped selfies on his smartphone. Petry's party and its counterparts across Europe are seeing an unprecedented surge in support. Wilders' Freedom Party is now polling ahead of its rivals in the Netherlands, where elections are scheduled in March. Le Pen has a shot at the French presidency a month later. AfD has managed to win seats in more than half of German state legislatures over the past couple of years and is expected to do the same in parliamentary elections this fall. That's the most support any nationalist faction in Germany has received since World War II. Compared to the fiery oratory of Le Pen, who riled up the largely German audience at the summit with predictions of a populist toppling of the EU, Petry drew more polite applause with her speech that sounded rather like a history lecture on the declining state of Europe. She's more relaxed and conversational when I meet her in Leipzig, arriving in jeans with her youngest child, Tobias, in tow. The elementary school-age boy is recovering from a cold and clings to her legs as she coaxes him to unpack his toys at a colleague's desk and play. Petry tells me she married her live-in boyfriend, Marcus Pretzell, right before Christmas. He's a member of the European Parliament and head of the North-Rhine Westphalia AfD branch. The party recently announced that she's pregnant with their first child, which is her fifth. Call it practicing what you preach: Petry believes Germans having more children is the way to solve the worker shortage and other problems resulting from her country's aging population, rather than relying on immigration as the government does currently. European political party leaders greet supporters at a conference of European right-wing parties on January 21 in Koblenz, Germany.\n                \n                    \n                    Soraya Nelson /NPR\n                    \n                \nhide caption European political party leaders greet supporters at a conference of European right-wing parties on January 21 in Koblenz, Germany. \"It will be hard because you cannot force people to have children, obviously, and we do not want that anyway,\" she says. But she'd like to see the government provide financial incentives to encourage German couples \"to have more children, to start having children earlier\" \u2014 in their 20s, rather than in their 30s or later. As to why she thinks Muslim asylum seekers are a danger to Germany, Petry suggests reading Machiavelli. \"The principles of migration have always been the same,\" she explains. \"It's a question of period of time, process and numbers, and if migration population in the long run [outnumbers] the ethnic population of this country, the country will disappear, it will change dramatically. And that's what we see when we talk about illegal migration today in Germany and Europe.\" Petry claims to have no problem with Muslim immigrants who have assimilated into German society. But she completely rejects Chancellor Angela Merkel's claim that Islam belongs to Germany. \"If you talk about the religious differences, we do have serious problems with Islam and it's much easier to integrate someone from France, or from Poland, from Spain, from Britain or from wherever in Europe, into a European culture like the German culture than someone from a Middle East country,\" she says. \"I think that's obvious.\" The fear of German extinction is something Petry and her AfD party have successfully used to rally support in local elections over the past couple of years. Martin Kroh of the German Economic Research Institute in Berlin says that is not how the controversial party started out. AfD was founded in 2013 by economists, business leaders and academics who opposed German bailouts of the Eurozone. Their criticism of Merkel and the EU resonated with many Germans who were fed up with their country footing the bill for the euro debt crisis. Even so, AfD failed to get enough votes to meet the 5 percent threshold required to enter the German parliament in 2014. The following year, Petry and her allies took over. \"The party changed from this moderate, economic Euroskepticism to more right-wing, populist statements and also anti-immigrant positions, and also being more conservative on family policies,\" Kroh says. A Jan. 20- Jan. 23 poll by the German research firm INSA for the German newspaper Bild shows 14.5 percent of German voters plan to cast ballots for Alternative for Germany in national elections this September. Many of the votes are shifting from Chancellor Angela Merkel's Christian Democratic Union-led bloc. According to the poll, the bloc's approval rating dropped to 32.5 percent and if it keeps declining, Merkel will have a tough time forming a new coalition government. Her political allies are worried enough to have taken stances against migrants and the European Union that sound a lot like AfD's positions. Petry smiles when I ask her about that. \"These ideas have already been there for quite a while, but they were called racist or xenophobic or something else,\" she says. \"Politicians of all the other parties realize that all the so-called solutions up to now haven't worked.\" Still, Petry is pushing her party to tone it down, especially when it comes to anti-Semitism. The AfD is considering kicking out its Thuringia branch head, Bjoern Hoecke, for recently condemning the Holocaust Memorial in Berlin. He told supporters in Dresden on Jan. 17: \"We Germans are the only people in the world who would plant a monument of shame in the heart of their capital.\" Le Pen, Wilders and other European populist leaders say Petry should be the next German chancellor. But she isn't prepared to address a run in our interview. \"Our party has to enter the German parliament, first of all,\" she says. \"And I'm willing, and my party is willing, to change the political situation in Germany and in Europe. Anything else apart from that is way too early to discuss.\" She'll likely need a parliamentary majority to become chancellor because \u2014 like Wilders' Dutch opponents \u2014 no mainstream German party is willing to partner with Petry or her AfD.",

Popova says she had to leave Russia in 2014 because of her work as an aide to the only Russian member of parliament to vote against the annexation of Crimea. On a bright Sunday afternoon last November, Anastasia Popova was picketing outside the Russian Embassy in Washington with a dozen other activists. \"Russia will be free! Russia will be free!\" they chanted at the hulking white building on the other side of the street. The forlorn group of protesters held up signs calling for the release of a jailed Russian activist, Ildar Dadin, and displayed photographs of other people they called political prisoners in their home country. Under somewhat different circumstances, Popova, 29, might have been sitting inside the embassy looking out. She aspired to become a diplomat, but after getting involved in opposition politics in Russia, she had to make a choice. \"They told me: 'You can't work for the government in the daytime and prepare protests against that government in the evening,'\" Popova said. She chose politics \u2013 and joined the staff of Ilya Ponomaryov, one of the lone opposition voices in the Russian parliament. A time of uncertainty Russian opposition figure Ilya Yashin says he will stay in Russia despite the risks. He recently visited the U.S. and met with Russian exiles like Popova.\n                \n                    \n                    Lucian Kim/NPR\n                    \n                \nhide caption Russian opposition figure Ilya Yashin says he will stay in Russia despite the risks. He recently visited the U.S. and met with Russian exiles like Popova. Five years ago, Russia was in upheaval. Vladimir Putin's decision to run for an unprecedented third term as Russia's president was fueling street protests in Moscow and other cities. Politicians like Ponomaryov saw a potential opening to begin liberalizing Russia's tightly controlled political system. Hopes for a thaw were soon dashed. Putin, who had been president from 2000 to 2008, and prime minister from 2008 to 2012, won the presidential election in March 2012. Many protest leaders found themselves facing lawsuits and jail time. In 2014, Ponomaryov was the only member of parliament to vote against annexing Crimea, which Russia had just seized from Ukraine. Russian authorities then started building a criminal case against him. Ponomaryov moved to the United States, and before long, Popova says she got a warning that she, too, should leave the country \u2013 immediately. \"That was the end of October 2014. And that was my personal Halloween, you know, when I found myself in the U.S. with just a suitcase, and I had no idea where to go next,\" she said. A long tradition Popova follows in a long history of Russian political exiles dating back to the 1800s. In the past century, there have been spurts of immigration from Russia to the U.S.: Jews escaping persecution, Russian aristocrats fleeing revolutionaries, and dissidents getting the boot from the communist regime. Russian applications for political asylum in the U.S. have increased for the fourth straight year, according to a Freedom of Information Act request filed by Radio Free Europe. In the last fiscal year, 1,912 Russians applied for asylum, the highest level in more than two decades. Exiles granted asylum may be safe from persecution abroad. But they're also cut off from their homeland. \"Once they're out, it's actually quite difficult for them to have an influence back again,\" said Fiona Hill, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution in Washington. \"They run the risk of harming contacts, even family members, if they engage in overt political activity that in some way is involving organization of protest movements still in Russia itself.\" Hill said that the Internet affords little help to effect change at home. \"I think social media does add a different ingredient, but what it creates is a sort of a parallel alternative community,\" she said. \"It doesn't necessarily translate to action on the ground.\" Remaining in Russia Someone who's still trying to take action inside Russia is Ilya Yashin, an opposition leader refusing to leave. In late October he visited the U.S. to build bridges to members of Russia's far-flung diaspora. \"Sure, I agree, the risks are high. And from a certain point of view it probably is crazy to oppose Putin inside Russia. But somebody has to do it,\" Yashin said in an interview in an Alexandria, Va., coffee shop. \"The Putin regime is happy to get rid of its opponents and does everything it can so that we leave,\" Yashin said. \"That's the reason I see my mission to do everything so that Putin's critics stay in Russia. That's why I haven't left.\" Yashin said many political activists left Russia after his friend, opposition leader Boris Nemtsov, was assassinated outside the Kremlin in February 2015. As for Popova, she said exile was her only option. \"I believe that being in the U.S. and telling the U.S. government the truth about the political situation in Russia is more useful than just being tortured in jail,\" she said. When it comes to dealing with Russia in the future, Popova had a message for President-elect Donald Trump: Negotiate hard, don't make any concessions as a sign of good will, and keep expectations low.",

With President-elect Donald Trump's tough talk on immigration, private prisons may be an early winner under his administration. In the week after Election Day, stocks of GEO and CoreCivic, the two biggest for-profit detention companies, shot up more than 20 and 40 percent, respectively. Last spring at a town hall meeting on MSNBC, Trump said this about the confinement industry: \"By the way, with prisons I do think we can do a lot of privatizations and private prisons. It seems to work a lot better.\" Two possible categories of unauthorized immigrants who would go behind locked gates: First, the Trump campaign vowed to stop the catch and release of people who cross the border without documents to ask for asylum. And second, as president-elect, Trump has said he wants to deport 2 to 3 million \"criminal aliens.\" \"Detention is an inherent part of the machinery of deportation, and so I think we're looking ahead at massive expansion of our detention system,\" says Mary Small, policy director for Detention Watch Network, which opposes private prisons. \"And what we've seen over the last decade is that when the detention system grows that's mainly through the use of private prison companies.\" The Obama administration played red light, green light with the corrections industry. The Department of Homeland Security relies heavily on private lockups for more than 70 percent of its detainees. And recently, the agency has been signing contracts for hundreds of new detention beds. Meanwhile, the Department of Justice announced in August it wants to phase out all private prisons, including those that hold convicted immigrants. The inspector general declared them less safe and less secure than federal prisons. But Trump's Justice Department may reconsider private prison contracts, says Michele Deitch. \"This summer, the Justice Department decided to reduce its use of privatization, and I think that will certainly be looked at again under a Trump administration,\" says Deitch, who follows prison issues at the LBJ School of Public Affairs at the University of Texas, Austin. GEO and CoreCivic, formerly Corrections Corporation of America, declined to comment on whether a Trump presidency would be good for stockholders. In emails, the two companies' spokesmen emphasized their success as private partners for a government that doesn't like to build new prisons anymore. GEO said it \"provide[s] safe, secure and humane facilities\" for federal detainees. But it's been a rocky relationship at times. For-profit detention at all levels \u2014 federal, state, and local \u2014 has been the target of harsh criticism and frequent lawsuits. Just to name two: Last year, a private youth prison in Walnut Grove, Miss., was closed after a federal judge called it \"a picture of ... horror.\" And last month, a lawsuit filed by the Texas county of Willacy decried the \"abysmal mismanagement\" of an immigrant detention center in the town of Raymondville. The U.S. Bureau of Prisons severed its contract with that private facility after inmates rioted over living conditions in 2015. Deitch says what is certain under Trump is more opposition to private prisons, especially the policy of confining asylum seekers. \"And locking them up is really serving no public safety purpose,\" she says. \"So yes, I would expect that lawsuits will continue and challenges will continue to this practice of immigrant detention.\" The nation's customs commissioner, Gil Kerlikowske, recently had some startling news from the Southwest border. Kerlikowske said that apprehensions of illegal crossers \u2014 mainly Central Americans seeking refuge from violence, and job opportunities \u2014 can reach 2,000 people a day. Most of them don't flee; they surrender to agents. If Trump embraces the prison business as a lot of people think he will, there will be no shortage of detainees.",

            "article_content": "Germany goes to the polls on Sunday, and Angela Merkel is widely expected to win a fourth term as Chancellor. But disruption from the far-right and the hangover of the migrant crisis have made this campaign more difficult than Merkel is used to.  AILSA CHANG, HOST: Germany is holding parliamentary elections this Sunday, and the country's chancellor, Angela Merkel, is widely expected to win a mandate for a fourth term. As the leader of the center-right Christian Democrats, Merkel is already one of the longest-serving leaders in modern-day Germany. She's also seen by many as the world's most powerful voice for liberal values and has become something of a foil to Donald Trump's foreign policy pronouncements. To talk about these upcoming elections, we're joined now by NPR's Berlin correspondent Soraya Sarhaddi Nelson. Hi, Soraya. SORAYA SARHADDI NELSON, BYLINE: Hi there. CHANG: So Merkel may be widely expected to win again, but she hasn't exactly had a smooth path to a fourth term. What are some of the problems she's faced? NELSON: Well, the first one is actually quite unusual in German campaigning, and that's that she has protesters from the right wing heckling her and shouting her down at every one of her rallies. That's just not done here. And the other thing is that she's never quite overcome the public backlash about her decision in 2015 to open German borders to nearly a million asylum seekers and other migrants. Her center-right CDU party isn't seeing the kind of approval ratings as they did in earlier campaigns. Stefan Kornelius is the foreign editor of Germany's daily Suddeutsche Zeitung and has written a book about Merkel. STEFAN KORNELIUS: Suddenly and surprisingly Merkel has become a very polarizing figure. As much as she pushed to the center on the refugee issue and brought in the left part of electoral voters in her camp, as much she did lose on the right side. NELSON: But Kornelius says even so, Merkel being attacked by the right-wing populists could actually gain her sympathy votes on Sunday. CHANG: It sounds like it's unlikely that Merkel's party will get enough seats for her to govern on her own, so she'll have to form a coalition, right? Any idea who with? NELSON: There's a number of parties she could partner with. But what's more interesting is what Merkel has said about who she won't work with. And one is the Left Party, which is the successor of sorts to the East German Communists. And then the other one is the right-wing populists' Alternative for Germany. And it's widely expected that that, the latter party, will be the third-largest vote getter on Sunday, which could be actually the most crucial thing about this election because it will be the first time since the end of World War II that a party many dismiss as xenophobic would be in Parliament. And it could have an effect on how Germany is governed over the next four years. CHANG: How has Merkel managed to have such a long career in politics so far in Germany? NELSON: Well, the main thing is that Germany has really boomed economically under her leadership despite the fact that there was a financial and euro crisis some years back. Germans are really attracted to that stability. Germans also really love the fact that she's down-to-earth. She lives modestly in Berlin, and she actually does her grocery shopping herself. CHANG: (Laughter). NELSON: I have friends who say that she's a regular at their local supermarket where you can see her returning her own plastic bottles and filling her grocery cart. CHANG: Oh, imagine that. So you know, there's clearly been tension between Merkel and President Trump. How do you think Germany's relationship with the U.S. might continue if Merkel ends up serving yet another term? NELSON: Well, I think we can pretty much count on her speaking out against President Trump even more than she's doing now when he makes pronouncements that worry Germany and the rest of Europe. But Merkel has also made it clear that she's not interested in shutting the door entirely on the Trump administration. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) CHANCELLOR ANGELA MERKEL: (Speaking German). NELSON: During her recent debate, she said that there are issues Germany and the U.S. have to work on together like ISIS and Afghanistan, and she said she's going to continue talking to Trump about their differences and will do her best to find resolution and common ground. And it's also important to note that one thing President Trump likes about her is the fact that she plans to increase Germany's defense budget. CHANG: All right. That's NPR's Soraya Sarhaddi Nelson.

            "article_content": "Germany's defense minister is in conflict with her generals over allegations that they have long ignored far-right infiltration of the armed forces.  KELLY MCEVERS, HOST: We're learning about a bizarre terrorist plot in Germany. Prosecutors say an army officer registered as an asylum seeker, hoping his planned attacks would be blamed on refugees. And media reports say the man actually had neo-Nazi sympathies and was linked to a secret extreme right group within the German armed forces. Germany's defense minister is vowing to investigate fully. NPR's Soraya Sarhaddi Nelson reports from Berlin. SORAYA SARHADDI NELSON, BYLINE: The far-reaching investigation comes after the recent arrest of a German army lieutenant who is accused of posing as a Syrian refugee and planning terror attacks. It's one of 280 allegations of far-right extremism authorities are investigating in the military here. It's also one of several recent scandals, including hazing and sexual abuse, that have pitted German defense minister Ursula von der Leyen against her generals. She is blaming weak oversight for allowing extremism to fester within the ranks. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) URSULA VON DER LEYEN: (Speaking German). NELSON: In an interview with public broadcaster ARD, von der Leyen said the investigation will delve deep and be painful, but many here say von der Leyen is being too heavy-handed in her criticism of military leaders. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) MARTIN SCHULZ: (Speaking German). NELSON: Martin Schulz, who is Chancellor Angela Merkel's main challenger in upcoming elections, told public broadcaster WDR that von der Leyen should stop assigning blame. Political responsibility for what happened lies with the defense minister, he says. Von der Leyen has Merkel's support and tried showing she is taking the matter seriously. She cancelled her official trip to Washington and New York, and with reporters in tow, went to the barracks in eastern France where the suspect was stationed with a Franco-German combat brigade. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) VON DER LEYEN: (Speaking German). NELSON: Speaking to the ARD interviewer, she said the suspect wrote his master's thesis three years ago while he was at the German military academy, and that it was flagged for its far-right and racist content. And yet, his superiors ignored it, von der Leyen said. (SOUNDBITE OF PRESS CONFERENCE) VON DER LEYEN: (Speaking German). NELSON: At a news conference at the French barracks, von der Leyen said most of Germany's quarter million soldiers deserve support and respect. It makes it all the more bitter, she said, that a small number of soldiers are ruining the German military's reputation. Soraya Sarhaddi Nelson, NPR News, Berlin.

            "article_content": "President Trump announced Wednesday executive actions that will reshape U.S. immigration policy, including plans for the wall, actions against sanctuary cities and new border patrol measures.  ROBERT SIEGEL, HOST: For more now on the president's executive orders on border security and how they might be implemented, we're joined by NPR's John Burnett, who covers immigration. And John, first, will anything happen immediately? JOHN BURNETT, BYLINE: Hey, Robert. Well, it's really the start of a long process. Most of this is going to play out over months and even years. The planning process for the wall needs to start now. Lots of things have to happen. They can't just start paving access roads and buying the steel down there in the desert - same thing with this call for 5,000 new Border Patrol agents that he's promised. That expands the force by 25 percent. In the past, agents have been hard to recruit. They have to pass rigorous vetting and academy training to wear the green uniform. What he can do overnight are some administrative changes within ICE of who federal agents can detain and deport. He can boost deportations really starting tomorrow. The agency can redefine who's a criminal alien, not just a murderer or rapist or a drug dealer under Obama's DHS but a drunk driver or a domestic abuser or a shoplifter. And likewise, ICE can start tomorrow putting asylum seekers in private prisons even more than they do now until their cases are resolved. But I can guarantee you there'll be lots of human rights advocates filing lawsuits on detention conditions. SIEGEL: And, John, how would you say these measures would actually change the way that border patrol and immigration enforcement agents do their jobs? BURNETT: Well, we heard the president say today he's asking agents to strongly enforce immigration laws. He wants to unshackle them. And after all, these are federal agents. They're cops. They have handcuffs and Tasers, and they want to do their jobs. They don't want to process asylum seekers all day. I know the agents want to do more. They want to - for instance, Border Patrol wants to start patrolling transportation centers like bus stations and airports. ICE wants to go back to the old policy of workplace raids if possible. But again, immigrant rights advocates are really going to be closely monitoring how these federal agents do their jobs. If they violate the constitutional rights of U.S. citizens, there will be more lawsuits so they don't overstep their authority. SIEGEL: In a congressional testimony, Trump's Secretary of Homeland Security, John Kelly - General Kelly, said that a border wall is not enough. What more does he have in mind? BURNETT: Well, you know, I've talked to lots of these border agents since the election, and they know that a wall - this greatly touted wall - is not really a panacea for border security. The agents know their other measures are just as important - stadium lights, ground sensors, camera towers and, most of all, agents. The wall is kind of symbolic language even though we heard it again and again and again. And it's likely to be a fence, not a wall. Even the language in Trump's executive order says, quote, \"physical wall or other similar secure, contiguous and impassable physical barrier.\" SIEGEL: Although... BURNETT: So that leaves an option open. SIEGEL: Although when he spoke of this, he very explicitly said today a wall, once again. But yes, go ahead, John. BURNETT: Yeah, he did. But actually what they construct on the southern border are fences. SIEGEL: What about funding for these fences (laughter) or walls or whatever they are? BURNETT: (Laughter) Well, these are going to be expensive, significant expenditures. You know, the wall could be, you know, $5, $10, $15 billion. New agents are expensive. More detention space for deportees is expensive. You've got to sign those contracts with the private prison companies for tens of millions of dollars or build your own. So this will take an appropriation from Congress. SIEGEL: Other things to expect from Trump on immigration... BURNETT: Well, Robert, the big piece that he did mention is what happens with the dreamers, the DACA, Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals. These are some 750,000 young people who were brought here as children by their undocumented parents. Obama gave them work permits and protection from deportation. Trump said in the campaign he was going to cancel Obama's order on DACA, but now he's soft pedaling. Sean Spicer said at the White House briefing today, the president's still working on DACA. He's a family man. He's going after criminals, criminal aliens, not families. SIEGEL: OK, that's NPR's John Burnett. Thanks. BURNETT: You bet. Copyright \u00a9 2017 NPR.  All rights reserved.

            "article_content": "Democrats mocked House Republicans after Republicans passed their health care measure, suggesting the GOP could lose in 2018. And Barack Obama has endorsed French candidate Emmanuel Macron.  DAVID GREENE, HOST: And we start this morning with Republicans declaring victory and Democrats singing. RACHEL MARTIN, HOST: Yeah, singing - we'll get to that. After months of trying to get a vote on health care, President Trump declared a win on one of his key campaign promises. House Republicans passed a bill yesterday to replace the Affordable Care Act. Democrats said the vote will come back to haunt their colleagues on the other side of the aisle. This is where we get to the singing. As the last votes were cast, a chorus of lawmakers broke into song implying that they would lose their seats in the next election. They waved farewell at Republicans from across the chamber. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) UNIDENTIFIED DEMOCRATIC HOUSE REPRESENTATIVES: (Singing) Na, na, na - hey hey, hey, goodbye. GREENE: Na, na, na, na - na, na, na, na - hey, hey, hey, goodbye. Let's bring in NPR music critic Susan Davis (laughter) to talk about what she just heard. She's actually NPR's congressional correspondent. Hi, Sue. SUSAN DAVIS, BYLINE: Hey, David. And I was in the chamber for that. GREENE: You were? DAVIS: I was. GREENE: How was it? DAVIS: You know, it's actually sort of... MARTIN: Weird. DAVIS: And it's happened before. And sometimes on these big votes, you often see the minority party jeering the majority for what... GREENE: Really? DAVIS: ...They believe is a political mistake, yeah. GREENE: Oh, I didn't know there was a history of this. Well, in this case, I mean, are Democrats being a little cocky? Are they so sure Republicans are going to lose elections over this vote? DAVIS: Well, you know, Democrats believe this is a politically unpopular vote for Republicans in the places where the majority matters, specifically in the 23 districts that Republicans represent that Hillary Clinton won in the last election. And of those 23, 14 Republicans voted for it; nine voted against it. And you can bet that those 14 Republicans are going to be hearing a lot about that vote as we go into next year's election cycle. You know, and there's historical trends behind Democrats. The presidents tends to lose seats in the House and the Senate in midterm elections. But I always caution - I'm not sure historical trends apply to Donald Trump. GREENE: This era does feel different in so many ways. OK, so there might have been just a handful or so of Republicans who are nervous listening to that music, not the entire caucus. So this moves to the Senate now. And I just want to listen to this voice. It's Republican Senator Lamar Alexander talking about what's next here. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) LAMAR ALEXANDER: We'll carefully consider the legislation passed by the House. We will work together carefully to write our own bill. We will make sure we know what our bill costs when we vote on it - in fact, by law, we have to do that. We will get it right, and then we will vote. GREENE: Sue, it almost sounds like he was chiding his Republican House colleagues for passing this thing before knowing the cost. What does that tell us about the road ahead here? DAVIS: He was. And several Senate Republicans did. He's correct. The Senate cannot move forward until they know what the bill is going to cost. I think we can expect a slower, more methodical approach. And at the end, it's likely we're going to see a very different bill. I can't presume to guess what it's going to look like, but I do know two things that we're going to be hearing a lot about in the Senate is they're concerned about what the House does to people with pre-existing conditions. And there's also concerns about what they do to the Medicaid program. GREENE: You know, one thing that has really interested me is the poll numbers. There's been this rise in popular support for Obamacare, the Affordable Care Act. Does that give Democrats some strength as they try to capitalize and wield some influence as the minority party? DAVIS: Well, we're going to have a test of that pretty soon. As you well know, there's a special election going on in Georgia, and it's the House seat of Health and Human Services Secretary Tom Price. They've already had the initial runoff. They're going to have the election in June. And this is going to be a real barometer of both Democratic enthusiasm and whether they can win in tough districts. This is a Republican-leaning district. It is also, at this point, the most expensive House race in history. They're getting over a $30 million hurdle, so there's a lot of enthusiasm and interest on both sides there. And it's going to be seen as an early bellwether. MARTIN: This was also a victory for Paul Ryan. Right? Speaker of the House, he needed to deliver a legislative win at this point after promising a repeal and replacement for Obamacare for so long, years. And now he owns this to some degree, as do Republicans. And Paul Ryan in particular is going to have to defend vulnerable House members against all those Democratic attacks that are likely to come in 2018. GREENE: All right. NPR congressional correspondent with us, Susan Davis - Sue, thanks as always. DAVIS: You bet. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) GREENE: And let's turn now to the French presidential election, which is this weekend. And Rachel, it seems like American presidents just can't help themselves. MARTIN: Yeah, right. So you may remember that Donald Trump weighed in on France's presidential election. Last month, he said far-right candidate Marine Le Pen would be the toughest on terrorism. Now President Obama is weighing in. He has officially backed a candidate. He recorded an endorsement for centrist candidate Emmanuel Macron. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) BARACK OBAMA: Because of how important this election is, I also want you to know that I am supporting Emmanuel Macron to lead you forward. En marche. Vive le France. GREENE: OK. Elle (ph)... MARTIN: En marche. GREENE: En marche. Eleanor Beardsley is here. NPR's Eleanor Beardsley in Paris - hey there, Eleanor. ELEANOR BEARDSLEY, BYLINE: Hi, you two. MARTIN: Hi. GREENE: So I'm going to assume that French voters are not there saying - oh, my gosh, who should I vote for? Well, let me see what an American president thinks. BEARDSLEY: (Laughter) No, David, they're not. But I talked to people yesterday who had seen that message, and they were surprised but pleased. And the Macron campaign, you know, really made a lot of it. They tweeted it out. They wanted people to know. He's still very popular here. So symbolically, that was something. And, you know, people here know that the world is following this election. The media talks about it a lot. They've always got foreign journalists saying the candidates' names with their accents. And, you know, after Brexit and the election of Donald Trump, will France now go for a far-right populist? People here know the world is watching. GREENE: Well, a lot of people were able to watch what sounds like quite a debate the other night between Macron and Marine Le Pen. BEARDSLEY: You know, it was. It was absolutely caustic and just heated and argumentative. The results of that debate are still being debated this morning. The big conclusion is it wasn't very presidential for a presidential debate and mostly because critics are saying that Marine Le Pen was just launching brutal attacks the whole time. Her image has actually been worsened by this. You know, she called Mr. Macron a rich banker who wanted to sack and pillage the French people for profits. Monday's - I mean, Le Monde's headline of the newspaper today says \"Strategy Of Lies,\" and it lays out 19 of her lies. And, you know, analysts say she debated a la Donald Trump, just accusations, insinuations and a lot of interruptions. She even became kind of weird. Listen to - this clip has been going around social media. Listen to this. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) UNIDENTIFIED MAN: (Speaking French). MARINE LE PEN: (Speaking French). UNIDENTIFIED MAN: (Speaking French). BEARDSLEY: So she accuses Macron of embracing conspiracy theories there about the far-right being out there in the fields, in the cities. And it's - it was very strange, and she used her hands a lot. And that's been going around social media. GREENE: Well, so you have a far-right candidate who's saying the far-right is not so scary. You have her opponent who seems like he's winning. What's at stake here this weekend in your mind? BEARDSLEY: This is just two completely different visions for the future of France. She says, you know, open borders and the E.U. - European Union - have wrecked France's economy. We must close borders, take back our sovereignty, protect people from globalization and immigration. He says, France must engage with the world. That's our traditions - we will be open; we will be competitive. But even with such big differences, people still don't know who to vote for. One in 4 say they can't vote for either - they're going to abstain. And 1 in 5 say that they're still undecided despite mainstream politicians coming out and saying you've got to vote against the far-right. So this is supposed to be an election with one of the highest abstention rates. Only 75 percent of French voters are supposed to come out and vote on Sunday. MARTIN: Which is pretty remarkable considering the central question, which Le Pen supporters have tried to frame as a question about what it means to be French. And of course, all of this is wrapped up in France's immigration debate in that country, how they're assimilating or not assimilating immigrant communities, which sounds a little bit familiar if you think about the U.S. election. GREENE: Right. BEARDSLEY: Absolutely, Rachel. GREENE: NPR's Eleanor Beardsley, it's always good to hear your voice, Eleanor. And thank you. BEARDSLEY: Thank you. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) GREENE: All right, we're going to leave you this morning with a story about alleged Russian meddling in an election. MARTIN: Yeah. And we're not talking about the U.S. Yesterday, the head of Germany's domestic intelligence agency reiterated the claim that Russia has been gathering political data in a series of cyberattacks. This is something that came up in the meeting earlier this week between German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin. Russia typically, as it has done, continues to deny any of this. Germany says it's working to strengthen its own cyber defenses ahead of their election in the fall. GREENE: Well, NPR's Soraya Sarhaddi Nelson is in Berlin. Hey, Soraya. SORAYA SARHADDI NELSON, BYLINE: Hey. Good morning. GREENE: So what did Russia do here? NELSON: Well, it's accused - actually, we should say Russian hackers who the government claims are not linked to them - the Kremlin claims are not linked - but during three weeks in 2015, they accessed about 20,000 computers in the German Parliament and their constituencies across the country. And it's still unclear this many years later exactly what was stolen, just that they - the fear is that it's going to be used the way - or that the Russians might suddenly decide to use it in the German elections, which are coming up here in the fall, just as they're accused of doing in the American campaign. And at the same time... GREENE: Yeah, it sounds sort of similar. NELSON: Yeah (laughter). German candidates are also worried about Russians using fake news because they've had experience with that in January 2016 when there was a lot of political damage inflicted on Chancellor Merkel because of the fake case of a 13-year-old girl named Lisa who claimed to have been raped by asylum-seekers, and that was proven not to be true at all. GREENE: Oh, wow. They've got the fake news that they're really - that's troubling. I mean, is Germany confident they can do something about this? NELSON: Well, they've already taken some steps, so one thing is that the government has embedded units in all of Germany's security agencies and military to more quickly identify and deal with cyberattacks. On the fake news front, they've introduced a draft bill, which is expected to be voted on by the Lower House of Parliament before the summer recess, that would clamp down on fake news, basically with fines, really hefty ones, up to $54 million on - that will be imposed on social media platforms that carry such items. GREENE: Wow, it's so interesting. NELSON: But perhaps the most interesting thing... GREENE: Yeah, well... NELSON: ...Is that the... GREENE: ...It's such an... NELSON: Sorry. Go ahead. GREENE: ...Interesting story to follow. Yeah, no. This is such an interesting story to follow. It sounds like a cyberwar could even be starting. That's NPR's Soraya Sarhaddi Nelson in Berlin.

In one of his most high-profile appearances since leaving the White House, former President Obama warned tens of thousands of young people in Berlin that \"the international order is at a crossroads.\" President Trump was also in Europe, chiding NATO members while in Belgium for not living up to agreed-upon defense-spending levels. Obama delivered an implicit rebuke to Trump's \"America First\" policy, saying in the modern, interconnected world, \"we can't isolate ourselves. We can't hide behind a wall.\" Despite being largely out of sight since leaving office (aside from appearing in occasional paparazzi photos on billionaires' yachts), Obama seemed eager to rejoin the debate over globalism that's been shaping elections in the U.S. and Europe. He stressed that an increasingly integrated economic order had delivered unparalleled peace and prosperity to the continent. But he cautioned that success could not be taken for granted. \"It has to be continually renewed, because there is a competing narrative of fear and xenophobia and nationalism and intolerance,\" Obama told the large crowd near Brandenburg Gate. \"We have to push back against those trends.\" That tension, between globalism and nationalism, has flared in recent elections in the West, be it Brexit (Great Britain's choice to leave the European Union), France, Germany and, of course, Trump versus Hillary Clinton. Obama, who offered an upbeat assessment of European progress, was joined on stage by German Chancellor Angela Merkel at an event marking the 500th anniversary of the Protestant Reformation. Later, Merkel would join Trump at the NATO summit in Brussels. In his speech, Trump goaded NATO allies to increase their defense spending. While Obama often made the same point, quietly, when he was president, he cautioned his audience in Berlin that military might should not be viewed in isolation. \"The national-security budget shouldn't just be seen as military hardware,\" Obama said, stressing the importance of diplomacy and development to national security, as well. Trump's budget proposal would move the U.S. in the opposite direction. It calls for deep cuts to the State Department and foreign aid budgets, while boosting spending on military troops. Obama did not back away from military power entirely, telling a young questioner, \"We do live in a dangerous world.\" As if to underscore that point, he and Merkel offered condolences to the victims of Monday's terrorist bombing in Manchester, England. \"It's a reminder that there is great danger and terrorism,\" Obama said, \"and people who would do great harm to others just because they're different.\" The former president also defended his signature domestic policy, the Affordable Care Act, which the Republican Congress is working to repeal. \"Obviously, some of the progress that we made is imperiled, because there is still a significant debate taking place in the United States,\" Obama said. He conceded the law, commonly known as Obamacare, had not extended health insurance to all Americans. But it did boost coverage to some 20 million people. \"For those 20 million people, their lives have been better,\" Obama said. \"And we've set a standard for what's possible that people can build on.\" This week, the Congressional Budget Office predicted that a GOP replacement bill passed by the House would leave 23 million fewer people with health insurance by 2026. \"If we're going to solve the problems that we've discussed here,\" Obama told his audience, \"people have to be involved. They have to get engaged.\"",

            "article_content": "It's been five years since the death of Trayvon Martin \u2014 and the outrage that sparked the Black Lives Matter movement. Martin \u2014 17 years old, black and unarmed \u2014 was shot by George Zimmerman, a neighborhood watch volunteer in Sanford, Fla. Zimmerman was charged with second-degree murder and manslaughter. He claimed self-defense, and was later acquitted. After the verdict, there were demonstrations \u2014 and an emotional Facebook post by an activist named Alicia Garza. It read, in part: \"Black people. I love you. I love us. Our lives matter.\" That phrase was streamlined by her friend, Patrisse Khan-Cullors, and with the help of a third friend, Opal Tometi, \"black lives matter\" became a hashtag, a rallying cry and eventually a protest movement that gained steam after police killed Michael Brown in Ferguson, Mo. Since then, much has changed, Khan-Cullors tells NPR's Audie Cornish. \"In that moment, it wasn't popular to be in the streets. It wasn't a part of the mainstream dialogue,\" she says. \"What we've seen over the last five years is the popularization of protest and the willingness of both media but also Hollywood to talk about Black Lives Matter unapologetically.\" On whether the movement would have benefited from focusing on a single policy issue The movement is a decentralized one. Many different people across the country are entering from different angles. We're not looking for one fix-it policy. We're taking on our mayors, our chiefs of police, our sheriffs and our DAs. We're looking at the entire system and the ways that it can transform itself so that we can actually see a world where black lives matter. And I think it's been incredibly effective. On whether Donald Trump's election felt like a rebuke I'll say this: Whenever black people say enough is enough, we are often up against white nationalism. And so what this election showed us is our movement became too powerful and that white nationalism \u2014 although (it) has always existed \u2014 took power again. On Trump's voter base There are people who are white racists and identify as such. And there are people who are well-meaning white people who also voted for Trump. There also are a significant amount of people of color who voted for Trump. And I think we have to consider what kind of conditions allowed for people who actually believe in American democracy to vote for a Trump. On what lies ahead for the movement in the Trump era I see us moving forward with a renewed focus. We have to defend and protect our communities, but we also have to build a long-term strategy to ensure that those who are most at the margins, that we'll actually be able to build real political power.

From the U.S. Senate race in Alabama to the tax debate in the U.S. Congress, the role of religion in American politics is once again front and center. In Alabama, Republican candidate Roy Moore is an unabashed Christian nationalist, arguing that the United States was established as a Christian nation, to be governed by Christian principles. \"I do believe what the Bible says, and I believe for our country it's historically been true,\" Moore declared at his most recent campaign rally. \"I have vowed, when I go to Washington, D.C., as a United States senator, to take a knowledge of the Constitution and the God upon whom it is founded.\" As an Alabama judge, Moore installed a stone monument to the Ten Commandments in the state judicial building. \"The institutions of our society are founded on the belief that there is an authority higher than the authority of the State,\" he said at the installation, \"[and] that there is a moral law which the State is powerless to alter.\" He subsequently defied a court order to remove the monument, and he told lower courts in Alabama to ignore the Supreme Court ruling that legalized same-sex marriage, because he considered it contrary to the teachings of the Christian Bible. Many politicians base their votes and actions in large part on their religious beliefs, but Christian nationalists like Moore take that idea a step further. \"What they're saying is that our laws and our regulations should be affirmatively guided by these Christian principles, not just that individuals [should be] guided by these beliefs,\" says religion writer Sarah Posner, author of God's Profits: Faith, Fraud, and the Republican Crusade for Values Voters. The extent to which there should be an explicit Christian direction in the U.S. government has vigorously been debated in evangelical circles. An estimated 80 percent of white evangelicals supported Donald Trump in the 2016 presidential election, according to exit polls. What mattered to them was less Trump's Christian faith than their belief that as president he would appoint conservative Supreme Court justices and promote other causes that reflect their values. This elevation of political priorities over character, however, has troubled some evangelical theologians. \"Churches should not pretend to be public policy think tanks,\" says Bruce Ashford, a professor of theology and culture at Southeastern Baptist Theological Seminary, which is affiliated with the Southern Baptist Convention. \"They shouldn't try to sway elections from the pulpit. They should preach the Gospel.\" Political activity by Christian ministers and their church congregations is currently under discussion in part because Congress, in its review of tax law, is considering whether to repeal the \"Johnson Amendment,\" named after its original sponsor, then-Sen. Lyndon B. Johnson. The law, enacted in 1954, says that religious organizations that engage in activities to influence elections can lose their tax exemption. Many evangelical Christian leaders want to see those restrictions lifted. Bruce Ashford agrees, even while saying churches should stick to preaching the Gospel. \"My preference would be for churches to regulate themselves,\" Ashford argues. \"God has created different sectors of society, each with limits to its jurisdiction. Churches shouldn't pretend to be public policy think tanks, but conversely, Congress has limits to its jurisdiction and shouldn't regulate what a church can or cannot say.\" This is also the view of the Alliance Defending Freedom, a Christian advocacy group at the forefront of the drive to repeal the Johnson Amendment. \"There are separate legal and theological issues,\" says Erik Stanley, a senior counsel with the organization. \"The legal issue is, how do you protect the right of a church to speak freely without fearing government punishment? The theological issue is, how should a church address [concerns] from a practical perspective? But that debate over how a church speaks into the political process really resides at the church level.\" Advocates of the Johnson Amendment fear that if churches gain new political clout, one effect could be to empower Christian nationalists who may favor a theocratic state. \"Repealing the Johnson Amendment would open up the possibility of them politicizing their faith in new ways,\" says Sarah Posner.",

Arizona Sen. John McCain stepped up his criticism of the White House over the weekend, blasting President Trump for seeming to accept Russian leader Vladimir Putin's assurances that the Kremlin didn't interfere in U.S. elections. \"There's nothing 'America First' about taking the word of a KGB colonel over that of the American intelligence community,\" McCain said in a written statement, referring to Trump's stated foreign policy objective and to Putin, a former operative in the Russian intelligence service. \"Vladimir Putin does not have America's interests at heart. To believe otherwise is not only naive but also places our national security at risk,\" McCain, the chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, said. Trump, who met with Putin on the sidelines of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation summit in Danang, Vietnam, told reporters that he had again asked Putin if he meddled in the election. Speaking on Air Force one, Trump said Putin had told him that he \"absolutely did not meddle in our election, he did not do what they are saying he did.\" \"I asked him again. You can only ask so many times,\" the president said. Later, the president sought to clarify, saying: \"I believe that he [Putin] feels that he and Russia did not meddle in the elections.\" \"As to whether I believe it, I'm with our agencies,\" Trump said, \"As currently led by fine people, I believe very much in our intelligence agencies.\" Although the president has wavered in his assessment about Russian interference in the November election \u2013 alternately calling it \"fake news\" and acknowledging that it happened \u2014 his intelligence chiefs have not, save for CIA Director Mike Pompeo who did, only to have his own agency later walk back his remarks. McCain has become increasingly critical of President Trump in recent weeks. The Arizona Republican denounced \"half-baked spurious nationalism\" and the abandonment of U.S. global leadership in what amounted to a thinly veiled excoriation of the White House. McCain's unvarnished criticism comes as independent counsel Robert Mueller's investigation of possible collusion between Russia and the Trump campaign to damage the candidacy of Hillary Clinton heats up.",

Jeff Flake, R-Ariz., accompanied by his wife Cheryl, leaves the Capitol in Washington on Tuesday after announcing he won't seek re-election in 2018. Sen. Jeff Flake, the Arizona Republican who announced his retirement in a withering speech aimed at President Trump, tells NPR that he is \"deeply saddened\" to leave the Senate, but that lawmakers must take a stand now against the administration's behavior or \"lose that chance.\" Addressing his Senate colleagues on Tuesday, Flake \u2014 who has sparred with the president for months \u2014 called out the Trump administration for what he described as its \"casual undermining of our democratic ideals\" as well as \"reckless, outrageous and undignified\" behavior. Speaking to Morning Edition host Steve Inskeep, the senator said it \"was a tough speech to give.\" \"I love this institution. I'm not leaving because I'm sour on the Senate or Congress,\" he says. \"I'm deeply saddened to leave it.\" Flake, who served four terms in the House before being elected to represent Arizona in the U.S. Senate in 2013, said he would retire in early January 2019 rather than seek a second term. The expectation that Trump would grow into the presidency has not materialized. \"[The] pivot we all hoped for isn't coming. \"Before this becomes the new normal, I think we have to stand up and say this is not normal behavior,\" Flake tells NPR. \"And if we don't stand up now, we're going to lose that chance.\" The senator's harsh words come on the heels of increasingly vocal criticism of Trump from a handful of influential Senate Republicans. Just over a week ago, Sen. John McCain, Flake's Arizona colleague, warned about the rise of \"half-baked, spurious nationalism.\" And Sen. Bob Corker, R-Tenn., has openly questioned the president's competence and referred to the chaotic White House as \"an adult day care center.\" Corker, chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, announced last month that he would not seek re-election next year, all but acknowledging that the White House has made it impossible to do his job. Flake, who has consistently enjoyed high marks from conservative groups, says that in the current political climate, that isn't enough to get elected. \"Now you have to behave differently and be more angry and take positions and act in ways that I don't think are becoming of conservatives,\" he says, adding that he believes \"this fever will go down at some point.\" \"The spell will break. Resentment is not a governing philosophy,\" he tells NPR. \"You need to legislate, and in order to legislate, you need to work with your friends across the aisle. You can't refer to them as clowns or losers, as the president has done,\" he says. Flake, a member of the Foreign Relations Committee, says he is worried about America's foreign policy, which he says is \"chaotic\" under the Trump administration. \"There is something to the old 'madman theory,' to keep your adversary off base, not knowing what you'll do,\" he says, referring to the unofficial foreign policy first associated with the Nixon White House to convince potential enemies that the president could be unpredictable under pressure. \"There has to be some underlying strategy. I'm not sure that we have that,\" Flake tells NPR. \"It's not a good sign and doesn't bode well for peace and security long term.\" Asked by Steve whether he thinks \"something needs to be done\" about Trump, the Flake replies: \"If you are asking if I think the president has committed high crimes or misdemeanors, I don't think so.\" \"And I don't think there is any Article 25 remedy,\" he says, referring to a clause in the U.S. Constitution that provides for removing a president who \"is unable to discharge the powers and duties of his office.\" \"I just think we just ought to stand up and require something better in terms of behavior and treatment of members of Congress and others, Gold Star families, you name it,\" Flake says. \"But that doesn't have to involve any remedy like the 25th Amendment or impeachment proceedings.\"",

He told the Arizona Republic \"there may not be a place for a Republican like me in the current Republican climate or the current Republican Party.\"  ROBERT SIEGEL, HOST: This is a day that put in stark relief the gaping Republican divide between President Trump and the establishment of the party as well as where the party has been and where it's going. For much of the day, an escalating feud between Trump and Tennessee Republican Senator Bob Corker played out with the two trading insults online. But then another Trump critic went to the Senate floor and stunned his colleagues. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) JEFF FLAKE: I'm announcing today that my service in the Senate will conclude at the end of my term in early January 2019. SIEGEL: That is Arizona Republican Senator Jeff Flake. He went on to criticize Trump without mentioning his name. NPR political editor Domenico Montanaro is with us now. And Domenico, how much of a surprise was this announcement by Flake today? DOMENICO MONTANARO, BYLINE: It's a very big surprise. You know, he was facing a primary threat in his state. But he made this broader and said that he wasn't willing to do what was necessary to win by his conscience. And he said that, you know, President Trump is essentially a threat to democracy. So when it comes from the top, it is a major problem. SIEGEL: Let's take a listen to a little bit more of what Senator Jeff Flake said today on the Senate floor. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) FLAKE: I am aware that there is a segment of my party that believes that anything short of complete and unquestioning loyalty to a president who belongs to my party is unacceptable and suspect. If I have been critical, it is not because I relish criticizing the behavior of the president of the United States. If I have been critical, it is because I believe it is my obligation to do so and as a matter and duty of conscience. SIEGEL: Senator Flake's voice there was shaking, Domenico - obviously a very emotional moment, a very emotional day for him. MONTANARO: Absolutely. But you know, conservatives who are aligned with Steve Bannon and aligned with President Trump, Steve Bannon being the former chief strategist to President Trump in the White House, are celebrating today. You know, this is something that they were hoping for. They were going after Jeff Flake. They're going after other senators, including Bob Corker, by the way, that senator from Tennessee who's been feuding with President Trump. He's also retiring. So both of these men - even though they're speaking out against President Trump and what they see as threats to democracy, they're getting off the stage. SIEGEL: Well, Jeff Flake told the Arizona Republic today - and I'm quoting now - \"there may not be a place for a Republican like me in the current Republican climate or the current Republican party.\" Is he right? MONTANARO: Well, what we're seeing frankly is a crackup in American politics. You know, I've been saying for a little while that I think that there are kind of four strains of political ideology in this country. You've got your sort of center-left and center-right political establishment, the kind of - on the right, you've got these - you know, the George W. Bushes, the John McCains, Bob Corkers, Jeff Flakes. And they're all coming out and criticizing President Trump, all feel like they're in the wilderness. But none of them really is in charge of the Republican Party at this point. This is President Trump's party. And Pew came out with a poll today saying there might even be eight strains of different types of people in this country, and none of them can understand any of the other. SIEGEL: So Jeff Flake says he will not seek re-election, and unlike some other people at odds - publicly at odds with Donald Trump and the Republican Party, he's relatively young man who presumably had a future ahead of him. There was the Twitter feud between Senator Corker, who's retiring - senator - Republican senator from Tennessee - also speeches criticizing President Trump, if not explicitly by name, from former President George W. Bush, John McCain this week. MONTANARO: Absolutely. But you know, you've got President Trump, who over the last eight, nine months - you know, he ran on the idea of draining the swamp. And there might be a lot of people who think that Jeff Flake, John McCain, George W. Bush aren't the swamp, but people from Trump's perspective do. They think that they are the swamp. So you're seeing the remaking of Washington, whether it's federal officials who have stepped aside or now these senators who've decided to get off the stage really, in President Trump's view, now here draining the swamp. SIEGEL: And the difference here - the divide is both tonal. But also you could identify a set of issues or a political outlook that puts Flake, Bush, McCain, Corker on one side and Trump on the other. MONTANARO: You know, it may come down to something of civility, but there's also globalism, the idea of free trade and less of this protectionism that really President Trump and this nationalism that's pushed for as opposed to something, you know, not wanting to push, you know, a disunification, especially when it comes to things like grievance, in particular white grievance.

Khan was born in Pakistan, but when I ask him where he's from, he says Charlottesville, Va., because \"whenever anybody asks me, that is the first answer that comes to my mind.\" Khan tells me he was the first in his family to go to college, and it was in college that he first encountered the U.S. Constitution and the Declaration of Independence. He says its line about the right to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness \u2014 those \"self-evident truths\" \u2014 was not self-evident where he lived. \"I have lived under two martial laws,\" he says. \"Dictators decided what rights we will have, what rights we will not have. Can I come out of my home, and what time I can come out of my home ... I have seen with my own eyes newspapers burned, stopped because they were critical of the dictator.\" On getting a job in Dubai and meeting his first American Oh, I lose my composure if I think of him. Allen [Crowell] was my first boss that hired me, in Dubai. What a wonderful man. I had not slept properly for the past two nights, I go report to work, very first day, he looks at me, he picks up the phone and he calls his wife. Within 45 minutes, Lisa shows up, and then he says to me, \"Khizr, we have a place for you to rest.\" On his lapel pin This pin is to commemorate all those, my sons and daughters, that have given their all in defense of this country. It's a gold star pin. No family wishes to have it. No family wishes to have it. If you are fortunate to have this, it symbolizes not only the sacrifice of Captain Humayun Khan, but for all \u2014 and I call them literally my sons and daughters \u2014 that have sacrificed their life. ... my faith in the goodness of this country, in the values of this country, in the human dignity of this country is stronger now than ever before. Khizr Khan On how he felt about Trump's victory and his voters I was heartbroken, I was saddened, I remain saddened \u2014 but then my faith in the goodness of this country, in the values of this country, in the human dignity of this country is stronger now than ever before. I do respect their choices, I do respect their preferences and concerns. To some extent those concerns were misguided ... I went to London to participate in a debate, and by some very thoughtful people, I was reminded [of] three things. They said, Mr. Khan, when you go back, talk about these three issues: Nationalism, economic wellbeing, fear of immigrants. These three scripts have been used in Europe twice, First World War, Second World War. Same scripts are being used in the United States. On how often he thinks of his son, Captain Khan A similar question was asked of Ghazala, and this is what Ghazala said: \"Why do these people ask me that? ... I see him every day. I hear him every day. He is here.\" Because of our handicap, because of our limitation, we may not be able to communicate directly with them, see them physically. But they are with us. We feel the presence of Captain Humayun Khan every moment, every day. This story was edited for radio by Arezou Rezvani and Kelli Wessinger, and adapted for the web by Petra Mayer.",

            "article_content": "Former Vice President Joe Biden's recent flurry of events have raised questions about whether he is considering a 2020 presidential bid.\n                \n                    \n                    Alex Wong/Getty Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption Former Vice President Joe Biden's recent flurry of events have raised questions about whether he is considering a 2020 presidential bid. This week, the typically upbeat, jovial Joe Biden sounded anything but during a speech in Washington. \"President Obama and I have been very quiet and respectful, giving the [Trump] administration time,\" the former vice president said Thursday night. \"But some of these roots are being sunk too deeply. I believe it's time to challenge some of the dangerous assumptions.\" Biden went on to excoriate the Trump administration's foreign policy. While accepting an award from Center for Strategic and International Studies, Biden said he was worried the country is \"walking down a very dark path that isolates the United States on the world stage.\" The sober and stark speech was just one of several public appearances Biden made over the past week, including a campaign appearance in Alabama with Doug Jones, the Democrat running in the state's special Senate election. And in November, Biden is set to release a new book, which means the veteran politician who somewhat regretfully passed on a 2016 bid will make many of the same media stops that Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton did when she promoted her recent campaign memoir. All these moves raise the question of what, exactly, Biden is trying to accomplish \u2014 a possible political comeback or simply being protective of the policies he and former President Barack Obama helped implement. Biden specialized in foreign policy during his lengthy Senate career and was a key player in many of the Obama administration initiatives that Trump is now trying to undo \u2014 the Paris climate accord, the Trans-Pacific Partnership and, possibly next, the Iran nuclear deal. \"We're seeing a shift toward a theory of foreign policy that is closed-off and clannish,\" Biden said Thursday. \"One that groups the world into 'us' and 'them.' \" It's clear Biden is deeply offended by \u2014 and worried about \u2014 Trump's international approach. \"Among the many problems plaguing this administration's foreign policy: ideological incoherence. Inconsistent and confusing messaging,\" the former vice president said. \"Erratic decision making. Unwillingness or inability to solve problems caused by understaffing.\" But that doesn't explain the political events like the Jones rally in Alabama and comments by his daughter that her father hasn't ruled out another White House run just yet. Democratic political strategist Steve Schale was involved in the \"Draft Biden\" effort ahead of the 2016 presidential race but doesn't think Biden's rising profile should necessarily be viewed through a 2020 lens. \"He has been very active trying to help win support for state parties and down ballot candidates his entire career,\" Schale said. \"He said when he left office he was not going to stop. He engaged in a Delaware state Senate race, he was just involved in Florida state Senate race. I think whether or not Joe Biden decides he wants to enter the 2020 conversation or not, the fact that he is out doing what he's done his entire career shouldn't come as any surprise to anybody.\" Nonetheless, Schale was quick to embrace the sales pitch that might accompany a third Biden run. \"I think it's quite possible that for the perfect response to Trump is somebody like Joe Biden, who is older, experience, very competent, very trustworthy,\" the Democratic strategist said. \"I think it could be a really nice contrast.\" But \"older\" and \"experienced\" aren't necessarily positives to some Democrats right now. Many ultimately viewed Hillary Clinton's decades-long career in the national spotlight as a major liability. Biden had already been in the Senate for 20 years when Clinton became first lady in 1993. Still, it's clear Biden loves the public eye, and at the Alabama rally, he had the crowd laughing and clapping along as Biden impersonated senators he served with and regaled them with his well-worn Scranton, Pa., stories. \"Every time someone would lose a job, my dad would repeat \u2014 if we heard it once, we heard it 50 times \u2014 'Joey, remember, a job's about a lot more than a paycheck. It's about your dignity. It's about your respect in the community,' \" Biden said at the rally for Jones. He is also trying to draw contrasts with the populist, nationalist message Trump rode to victory, and Democrats have long called upon Biden, with his blue-collar roots, to help them in more rural areas. As the midterms approach and those are places Democrats need to win in order to make inroads in the House and protect Senate seats, he will likely be a natural, in-demand surrogate once again. \"The appeal to populism and nationalism is a siren song,\" Biden said during his D.C. speech on Thursday. \"A way for charlatans to aggrandize their power, raise themselves up, break down those mechanisms designed within our Constitution and internationally to limit abuse of power, and destabilize the world.\" Still, one of the problems Biden is sure to run up against is that the party is in search of new blood, and some in the party aren't so eager to look backward. \"I think that it's time to pass the torch to a new generation,\" Rep. Linda Sanchez, D-Calif., said this week, referring to the septuagenarians that lead the Democrats in the House. \"They are all of the same generation. And again, their contributions to the Congress and to the caucus and the conference are substantial. But I think there comes a time when you need to pass that torch, and I think it's time.\" But it's clear Biden isn't ready to move out of the spotlight just yet, which appears to be as much about protecting what he and Obama built together as it is keeping his own political options open.",

President Trump led an incendiary rally at which he ripped at cultural divides, played to white grievance, defended himself by stretching the truth or leaving out key facts, attacked members of his own party and the media, played the victim and threatened apocalyptic political consequences \u2014 all the while ignoring political norms and sensitivities. The only thing that's surprising is if you're surprised by it. Trump held these kinds of rallies and made these kinds of comments repeatedly throughout the campaign. And even did so in Arizona. Remember back in August of last year when he flew to Mexico to meet with the Mexican president, where he was restrained and deferential, and then held a raucous rally later that day in Arizona? Granted, Trump's actions Tuesday night stand in stark relief from his sober, scripted speech about Afghanistan just a day earlier. He did not deliver specifics on how to fight that war, but his rhetoric suggested to some that a change might be afoot. There isn't. And the best bet is there never will be. On Tuesday night, as NPR White House reporter Geoff Bennett said on Morning Edition's Up First podcast, Trump was a \"guy settling scores\" who believes \"every crowd deserves a show.\" Defended his Charlottesville response and did so in a misleading way. He read from his original statement of Saturday, Aug. 12, the part about denouncing hate and bigotry. He left out the next few critical words \u2014 \"on many sides.\" That's what caused the controversy. Played to white grievance. \"They're trying to take away our culture,\" Trump said of activists calling for the removal of Confederate statues. \"They're trying to take away our history. And our weak leaders, they do it overnight. These things have been there for 150 years, for 100 years. You go back to a university, and it's gone. Weak, weak people.\" Teased a potential pardon of Sheriff Joe Arpaio. There was some early speculation going into Tuesday night that Trump could pardon Arpaio at his rally. (Arpaio was found guilty of criminal contempt for violating a court order by illegally detaining immigrants who did not have legal status.) The White House said before the rally that he would not pardon him there, but the president then went ahead and heavily teased that a pardon might be forthcoming. \"So was Sheriff Joe convicted for doing his job?\" Trump asked, whooping up the crowd. \"You know what, I'll make a prediction: I think he's going to be just fine. OK? But I won't do it tonight, because I don't want to cause any controversy. But Sheriff Joe should feel good.\" Played the victim. He used his partial statement on Charlottesville as a way to show himself as the ongoing victim of the \"fake news\" media. \"[T]hey're bad people,\" Trump contended of the press. \"And I really think they don't like our country.\" In a series of tweets Wednesday morning responding to coverage of the Phoenix rally, CNN journalist Sara Murray said journalists \"can hold our leaders accountable and still love our country. And we do.\" Criticized fellow Republicans. He never said their names, but it was clear Trump was criticizing Arizona's Republican Sens. John McCain and Jeff Flake. He noted that the Senate was \"one vote away\" from passing a health care bill. That prompted the crowd to chants of \"McCain must go.\" McCain, of course, is suffering from a deadly form of brain cancer. He was the deciding vote on the health care bill, voting against it last month. Flake has written a book criticizing Trump and the GOP's response to him. \"Nobody knows who the hell he is,\" Trump said of Flake. Trump also tweeted support of Flake's primary opponent, signaling a potentially very messy primary process in the spring of next year and into the summer of 2018. If Trump winds up endorsing several primary opponents to GOP incumbents, that would further splinter the relationship between Trump and Mitch McConnell, the Republican Senate leader. Threatened a government shutdown over the border wall. Perhaps the most potentially consequential thing Trump said Tuesday night was threatening a government shutdown if his border wall is not funded. There are no indications the wall will be funded to the extent he wants (and Mexico's not paying for it). The question is whether Trump sticks to the threat, accepts some half-loaf version of what he's asking for or if it's just all bluster. Speaking Wednesday, House Speaker Paul Ryan, R-Wis., said, \"I don't think a government shutdown is necessary and I don't think most people want to see a government shutdown.\" Ryan added that the House had already passed funding for border security including building a border wall. Trump's comments at this rally should stop the narrative that Trump will or can change. Think of this a little differently \u2014 that Trump, in fact, has been remarkably consistent. Consider: There has been a usual pattern. Here's how it goes: Trump says something attention-grabbing, outrageous or controversial. He gets lots of negative attention and criticism for it. Then, he adjusts and does something more on-script. The criticism dies down and people think maybe he is changing (\"pivoting\") and becoming more \"presidential.\" And then he undercuts that with a tweet or rally soon after. There's no reason to think that pattern will change. It's more likely he will continue to test the limits of provocation. Culturally divisive and inflammatory. The country is at a demographic crossroads, and polling suggests there are plenty of people who are bothered by how the country is changing. Trump picked up on that and ran with it. When his back is against the wall, it's something he is likely to come back to again and again. Someone who stretches the truth. There were plenty of things Trump said during the rally in Arizona that weren't quite true or were misleading. In addition to leaving out the full context that would have included his \"many sides\" remark, he also said, falsely, as PolitiFact points out, that CNN's ratings have gone down, that wages haven't gone up, that the media don't show images of his crowds, that there's been a \"historic increase in defense spending,\" that border apprehensions are down 78 to 80 percent, and on and on. The Washington Post this week noted that Trump has now surpassed more than 1,000 falsehoods as president. Not loyal, except maybe to his family. Trump is all about Trump. Look at how he has dealt with his White House and administration. He nearly threw Attorney General Jeff Sessions under the bus, for example, threatening his job on Twitter \u2014 and Sessions was one of Trump's earliest supporters and was behind Trump when no one else in the Senate would back him. Someone who brings a bazooka to a knife fight. Trump is a counterpuncher. But he not only lets almost no insult go unanswered \u2014 he goes to war. Trump repeatedly belittled his primary opponents; in the general election, two days after the Access Hollywood tape was released, Trump responded by holding a news conference with women who accused Bill Clinton of sexual misconduct \u2014 moments before a presidential debate; and as president, instead of ignoring criticism from cable-news hosts Mika Brzezinski and Joe Scarborough, he took to Twitter to call Scarborough \"Psycho Joe,\" Brzezinski \"low I.Q. Crazy Mika\" whom he denied a stay at Mar-a-Lago when she was \"bleeding badly from a face-lift.\" The White House defended the president after the Brzezinski remarks. \"I don't think that the president's ever been someone who gets attacked and doesn't push back,\" now-press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders told Fox in June. \"There have been an outrageous number of personal attacks, not just to him, but to frankly everyone around him. This is a president who fights fire with fire.\" Someone who is sensitive to criticism, plays the victim and blames the media. Perhaps the best explanation for why Trump dug in on Charlottesville is the implication that he is to blame for boosting white nationalism. Trump feels that no matter what he does, it will never be good enough and that the media seize on the worst possible narratives about him. For example, denouncing bigotry and hate, but \"many sides\" becoming the story. Or when he did denounce the KKK and neo-Nazis, his sincerity and timing were questioned. It has become almost clich\u00e9 for Trump to call the mainstream media \"fake news.\" Media criticism is Trump's crutch. And there's nothing more unifying for a divided team than the perception of a common enemy. So ... are you finally ready to accept Trump for who he is? The fact is, he's 71 and unlikely to fundamentally change.",

Updated August 19. President Trump's belated and halfhearted denunciation of the hate groups that marched in Charlottesville, Virginia., has cost him the support of numerous business leaders and fellow Republicans and prompted at least a half-dozen nonprofit organizations to cancel planned fundraising events at his Mar-a-Lago resort. By contrast, Trump's religious advisers have been mostly silent \u2014 with a single notable exception. A.R. Bernard, pastor of the Christian Cultural Center megachurch in Brooklyn, New York, announced on Friday that he has resigned from the president's Evangelical Advisory Board. \"It became obvious that there was a deepening conflict in values between myself and the administration,\" Bernard announced via Twitter. Bernard said he had \"quietly stepped away\" from his involvement in the advisory group \"several months ago\" and formally resigned on Tuesday. My statement regarding my resignation from the President's Evangelical Advisory Board. pic.twitter.com/Ocae6SQxjZ As of Friday, none of the remaining 24 members of Trump's evangelical group had resigned, and their failure to take a stronger stand against the president had exposed them to withering rebukes. When Matthew Dowd, chief strategist for George W. Bush's 2004 re-election campaign, tweeted that \"corporate America has a greater moral compass\" than the evangelical group, the comment was retweeted nearly 50,000 times. Such criticism put many of Trump's evangelical advisers on the defensive. \"We believe it would be immoral to resign,\" says Johnnie Moore, a lay evangelical leader who has served as an informal spokesman for the Evangelical Advisory Board. \"As faith leaders, we have been given an opportunity to speak directly to various members of the administration, to provide not just policy counsel but personal counsel. We're personally involved in the lives of all these people, praying for all these people, and answering their questions.\" In announcing his resignation, Bernard said he had agreed to serve on the advisory group because he thought he could play a useful role. \"In a social and political climate such as ours,\" he wrote, \"it often takes a gathering of unlikely individuals to shape the future of our nation on issues of faith and inner city initiatives. I was willing to be one of those unlikely individuals.\" Whether other members of the advisory group are likely to follow Bernard's example is unclear. Many were with Trump during his campaign and supported him politically. Trump's business advisors, on the other hand, came from a more diverse background and had fewer political ties to the president. Business and religious leaders may also see their responsibilities differently. Corporate officers are especially sensitive to public pressure, because they have to worry about alienating their customers or angering their stockholders. The haste with which many U.S. corporations respond to consumer boycotts is an indication of their sensitivity to public sensibilities. Most evangelical leaders, including those who advise the White House, have been focused on ministry in recent days. Politics has been the last thing on our brain. Johnnie Moore, lay evangelical leader Religious leaders, meanwhile, may see their role in more private terms. \"Most evangelical leaders, including those who advise the White House, have been focused on ministry in recent days,\" says Moore, who has advised several public figures on outreach to Christian communities. \"Politics has been the last thing on our brain. We've been reaching out, doing what the Bible calls us to do as ambassadors of reconciliation, reaching across the aisle, [and] reaching out to other ministers.\" Many conservative evangelicals, however, did not hesitate to criticize Barack Obama or Bill Clinton when they objected to their policies or felt their presidencies were tainted, so the reluctance of Trump's advisers to address his comments has been noteworthy. Some have had nothing at all to say about either the Charlottesville rally or Trump's response to it, while several others rushed to the president's defense. Jerry Falwell Jr., president of Liberty University, praised the president for his \"bold truthful statement\" about Charlottesville. Mark Burns, pastor of Harvest Praise and Worship Center in South Carolina, retweeted a link to a television interview in which he declared his support for Trump and criticized the counterprotesters. Robert Jeffress, pastor of First Baptist Church of Dallas, blamed the news media for misrepresenting Trump's comments. Other members of the president's advisory board limited their critical comments to the neo-Nazis and other racists in Charlottesville. Ronnie Floyd, a past president of the Southern Baptist Convention, issued a statement saying that \"white nationalism and white supremacism are anathema to the teachings of Christ. ... As Christians, we do not tolerate or condone these protests.\" Such comments went well beyond the president's assertions that \"many sides\" were responsible for the violence in Charlottesville and that the torch-carrying marchers included some \"very fine people,\" but the evangelical leaders have clearly been reluctant to challenge Trump directly. Bernard announced his resignation from the advisory board only after the resignations from Trump's business advisory group received considerable public attention. The Brooklyn megachurch pastor  is the second member of the Evangelical Advisory Board to resign since its formation last summer. James MacDonald, pastor of Harvest Bible Chapel in suburban Chicago, left the board in October, and in the intervening months he has clearly distanced himself from Trump. Preaching about Charlottesville last Sunday, MacDonald said he didn't want \"to call people out by name,\" but he left no doubt what he thought of the president's comments on the rally and the violence. \"The greater your influence,\" he wrote in a Facebook post, \"the greater your complicity, if you don't call the Charlottesville attack what it really was: a heinous act of domestic terrorism entirely rooted in racial hatred.\" \"It's the height of hypocrisy,\" MacDonald told his parishioners, \"to demand that people use the term 'Islamic terrorism' and then turn around and refuse to use similarly candid terms when referring to racial hate crimes",

Updated at 6:05 p.m. ET In a press conference on Tuesday, the president of the United States appeared to equate white supremacist marchers with counterprotesters who recently clashed in Charlottesville, Va. \"I think there is blame on both sides,\" he said, going on to take aim at what he called the \"alt-left.\" \"What about the fact they came charging with clubs in hands, swinging clubs. Do they have any problem? I think they do. As far as I'm concerned, that was a horrible, horrible day.\" The remarks were the latest in the administration's continued response to a weekend of protests that included torch-wielding protesters chanting racist messages including, \"Jews will not replace us.\" The confrontations between rally-goers and counterprotesters led to one woman's death. \"You had a group on one side that was bad, and you had a group on the other side that was also very violent,\" Trump added in his Tuesday remarks. \"And nobody wants to say it, but I will say it right now.\" This is the latest lurch in the president's shifting responses to the weekend's violence. Tuesday's remarks echoed Trump's initial Saturday statement, when the president condemned violence \"on many sides,\" drawing sharp criticism from many corners \u2014 including members of his own party. On Monday, Trump more sharply rebuked racist groups for their participation in the violent protests. However, the fact that his response came days after the protests still drew heavy criticism. \"Racism is evil,\" Trump said on Monday. \"And those who cause violence in its name are criminals and thugs, including the KKK, neo-Nazis, white supremacists and other hate groups that are repugnant to everything we hold dear as Americans.\" The swing from \"many sides\" to calling out white supremacist groups to \"both sides\" is the latest in a line of Trump's mixed messaging in responding to racist groups. While Trump seemed more willing to distance himself from racist groups long before his political career, the past decade has shown a man apparently ambivalent about drawing a clear line between himself and groups with racist ideas. Before Trump became a politician Trump's rhetoric well before his political career was more forceful in denouncing racist groups, but it also in retrospect contained the seeds of his 2016-era rhetoric. In a 1991 interview, for example, CNN's Larry King asked Trump his thoughts about David Duke, a former Ku Klux Klan grand wizard. Duke had recently gotten nearly 39 percent of the vote in a Louisiana gubernatorial election. \"Did the David Duke thing bother you? Fifty-five percent of the whites in Louisiana voted for him,\" King said to Trump. TRUMP: I hate seeing what it represents, but I guess it just shows there's a lot of hostility in this country. There's a tremendous amount of hostility in the United States. KING: Anger? Mr. TRUMP: It's anger. I mean, that's an anger vote. People are angry about what's happened. People are angry about the jobs. If you look at Louisiana, they're really in deep trouble. When you talk about the East Coast \u2014 It's not the East Coast. It's the East Coast, the middle coast, the West Coast ... In a 2000 interview with NBC's Matt Lauer, Trump was more direct. Lauer was asking Trump about his decision not to seek the Reform Party nomination for president. LAUER: When you say the [Reform Party] is self-destructing, what do you see as the biggest problem with the Reform Party right now? TRUMP: Well, you've got David Duke just joined \u2014 a bigot, a racist, a problem. I mean, this is not exactly the people you want in your party. And in a 2000 op-ed further explaining that decision not to run, he made fun of what he called the \"fringe element\" that embraces conspiracy theories. \"When I held a reception for Reform Party leaders in California, the room was crowded with Elvis look-alikes, resplendent in various campaign buttons and anxious to give me a pamphlet explaining the Swiss-Zionist conspiracy to control America,\" Trump said. He later was more explicit in denouncing Duke and other extremists, adding, \"I leave the Reform Party to David Duke, Pat Buchanan and Lenora Fulani. That is not company I wish to keep.\" Still, even decades ago, Trump's statements contained glimmers of his 2016 rhetoric. In that 1991 King interview, Trump said he was against what the Duke vote \"represents,\" but he also made it about a broad, nonspecific \"anger\" that was particularly connected to \"the jobs.\" Fast-forward 20 years, and Trump had grown more brazen. He eventually became a standard-bearer for the birther movement, which alleged that President Barack Obama was born in a foreign country (he wasn't). In 2011, Trump announced that he had sent investigators to Hawaii to look into Obama's birth, giving new prominence to the already years-old movement. Embracing birtherism meant emboldening people in places like Stormfront, which calls itself a \"white nationalist community,\" where readers embraced birtherism. And even after years of fact checks, it took until September 2016 for Trump to admit that Obama was indeed born in the U.S. Trump's ties in the 2016 campaign During the presidential campaign, Trump at times denounced racist ideas and organizations, but his campaign also did not appear to make a high priority of avoiding associations with those groups. \"Throughout the campaign he played an odd footsie with these people,\" said Heidi Beirich, director of the Southern Poverty Law Center's Intelligence Project. On one hand, for example, his campaign fired a staff member over racist Facebook posts. Likewise, early in the campaign, he supported the removal of the Confederate flag from the South Carolina state capitol. And in October 2016, campaign spokesman Jason Miller told Politico that the campaign didn't want the support of white nationalist groups. \"We have rejected and rebuked any groups and individuals associated with a message of hate and will continue to do so,\" he said. \"We have never intentionally engaged directly or indirectly with such groups and have no intention of ever doing so, and in fact, we've gone a step further and said that we don't want votes from people who think this way.\" But that pushback often came amid other, mixed, signals. For example, Duke in February 2016 said on his radio show that \"voting against Donald Trump at this point, is really treason to your heritage\" and called on his listeners to volunteer for the Trump campaign: \"Go in there, you're gonna meet people who are going to have the same kind of mindset that you have.\" Trump at first said he \"didn't know anything about David Duke\" (despite those comments he had made in 1991 and 2000). He told CNN's Jake Tapper, \"I don't know what group you're talking about. You wouldn't want me to condemn a group that I know nothing about. ... If you would send me a list of the groups, I will do research on them and certainly I would disavow them if I thought there was something wrong.\" The next day, Trump blamed the comments on a \"very bad earpiece\" and later in the week said on MSNBC's Morning Joe that Duke \"is a bad person\" and \"I disavowed him. I disavowed the KKK.\" The then-candidate also multiple times retweeted people with a history of white supremacist views (including an account with the handle @WhiteGenocideTM). That doesn't necessarily mean that Trump had some sort of grand strategy in mind. But those retweets, along with the delay in disavowing Duke, imply at minimum a carelessness in avoiding those associations \u2014 associations that had been plaguing his campaign. In fighting allegations of emboldening white nationalist groups, the Trump administration has at times chosen not to forcefully defend itself or rebuke those groups but rather to simply point the finger elsewhere. This is called whataboutism, a form of propaganda associated with Cold War-era Russia. For example, in August 2016, Trump twice retweeted tweets connecting Hillary Clinton to the late Democratic Sen. Robert Byrd of West Virginia, who had been a member of the Klan. (Byrd had apologized over the years and was even applauded by the NAACP upon his death in 2010 for doing so.) Similarly, midcampaign, Trump often chose to accuse Clinton of starting birtherism. Rather than addressing issues head-on, this tactic is a way of absolving oneself, as one Russia expert told NPR. \"You're saying that in the negotiations we have, that no one is perfect, and no one can claim to be, and as such, what this does is let you off the hook,\" said Vadim Nikitin. The Trump administration did something similar in its initial response to the Charlottesville attacks. \"What about the leftist mob? Just as violent if not more so,\" said a senior White House official, according to Vanity Fair correspondent Gabriel Sherman. Trump himself attempted to shift attention away from his own words and toward media coverage on Monday. Asked by CNN correspondent Jim Acosta to answer questions about Charlottesville since Trump had promised a press conference, Trump said answering questions \"doesn't bother me at all. But I like real news. You're fake news.\" Likewise, the president later tweeted, \"Made additional remarks on Charlottesville and realize once again that the #Fake News Media will never be satisfied ... truly bad people!\" Emboldening extremist groups There could be a litany of reasons why any given person who supports white nationalist ideology embraced Trump. It wasn't just retweets and slow responses to people like Duke; Trump promoted policies that they could get behind, including restrictive immigration policy, as well as the travel ban imposed on certain Muslim-majority countries. His \"America First\" slogan was in fact associated with the Reform Party that Trump denounced as \"fringe\" and has deeper isolationist and anti-Semitic roots, as NPR's Ron Elving has reported. While Trump at times chose to distance himself from extremists, many of them nevertheless saw themselves as his natural constituencies. When NPR's Steve Inskeep in 2016 asked Duke, then a Senate candidate in Louisiana, whether Trump voters were his voters, Duke was emphatic. \"Well, of course they are!\" Duke said. \"Because I represent the ideas of preserving this country and the heritage of this country and I think Trump represents that as well.\" David Duke (center) participates in a rally where a crowd of white nationalists is met by a group of counterprotesters in Charlottesville, Va., on Saturday.\n                \n                    \n                    Justin Ide/Reuters\n                    \n                \nhide caption David Duke (center) participates in a rally where a crowd of white nationalists is met by a group of counterprotesters in Charlottesville, Va., on Saturday. During the campaign, prominent leaders among these extremist groups likewise declared their allegiance to Trump and explained why they felt emboldened. \"I don't think Trump is a white nationalist,\" Richard Spencer told the New Yorker's Evan Osnos, but he added why he thought Trump might appeal to some of those people: Trump espoused the idea, Spencer said, that \"white people have \u2014 that their grandchildren might be a hated minority in their own country. I think that scares us. They probably aren't able to articulate it. I think it's there. I think that, to a great degree, explains the Trump phenomenon. I think he is the one person who can tap into it.\" Monday on Duke's radio show, there were glimmers of the empowerment that white nationalist now feel. Duke was joined by guest Mike Enoch (a pseudonym for Michael Peinovich, according to the Southern Poverty Law Center), founder of the website The Right Stuff, which has denigrated minority groups including Jews and African-Americans. Enoch warned the Trump administration about castigating those alt-right groups too much. \"Don't cuck. You don't get anything for it,\" he said. \"You don't win and you alienate your own people.\" (\"Cuck\" is a common insult in these circles, deriving from the word \"cuckold\" \u2014 it likens someone whose views are deemed insufficiently hard-line to a man who lets another man sleep with his wife.) Enoch said this as he and Duke criticized Attorney General Jeff Sessions for, in their opinion, coming out too strongly against the white nationalist protesters in Charlottesville. That would do nothing but alienate supporters, Enoch added, without gaining Sessions any support among centrists or those on the left. \"Once you've been identified by the left as an enemy, and Jeff Sessions and Donald Trump absolutely have been, you don't get any credit for cucking, for attacking your own side,\" he said. For his part, Duke was pleased with Trump's Tuesday remarks: \"Thank you President Trump for your honesty & courage to tell the truth about #Charlottesville & condemn the leftist terrorists in BLM/Antifa,\" he tweeted, referencing Black Lives Matter and a far-left protest movement.",

            "article_content": "Steve Bannon, Donald Trump, and the Nationalist Uprising by Joshua Green Paperback, 272 pages | Your purchase helps support NPR programming. How? In August 2016, three months before the presidential election, Republican nominee Donald Trump was behind in the polls. Instead of staying on message, the candidate was engaged in a politically damaging fight with the parents of an Army captain killed in Iraq. On Aug. 17, in an effort to change course, the Trump team appointed Steve Bannon, the former executive chairman of the conservative Breitbart News, to lead the campaign. Journalist Joshua Green of Bloomberg Businessweek says the switch would prove to be a turning point. \"[Trump] was headed toward a pretty serious loss, and Bannon brought his wealth of anti-Clinton knowledge into the campaign and managed to keep Trump focused on a target,\" Green says. Green argues that Bannon's experiences with Breitbart gave him a framework for mobilizing disaffected young white male voters who were attracted to Trump. Without such guidance, Green says, \"I don't think that Donald Trump would have been elected president.\" Despite Bannon's success in the campaign, Green says that the adviser's nationalist vision remains largely unfulfilled. \"The kind of tragic, Shakespearean irony of the Donald Trump-Steve Bannon relationship is that Bannon finally did find the vessel for his ideas who could get elected president ... [but who] now doesn't have the focus, the wherewithal, the self-control to even do the basic things that a president needs to do.\" Green's new book, Devil's Bargain, profiles Bannon and explains his role in Trump's election. On Bannon's role in the Trump administration now Life in Trump's inner circle is a constant roller coaster; you're either going up or you're going down. Earlier, Bannon fell out of favor when Trump decided that he was getting too much attention, and Jared Kushner kind of rose in his place, but now with the Russia scandal that's embroiled so many members of the Trump family and inner circle, Bannon, almost by default, is kind of back in good standing. And, in fact, Trump sent him back from Saudi Arabia on the foreign trip that he took in May to go and set up the outside legal organization that was meant to hive off the Russia scandal and try to keep Trump himself as separated from that as possible. On whether Bannon has any connections to Russia Not that I know of. Bannon, in a sense, was lucky, in that he came into the campaign very late. He came in mid-August of 2016, which was after a lot of the Russia meetings, including the June 9[, 2016,] Russia meeting with [Donald Trump Jr.] that's been so much in the news lately. So I don't think that Bannon is involved in anything that I've heard of, although the one lesson we've learned with Trump in his campaign is that you can really never rule anything out, no matter how far-fetched. Life in Trump's inner circle is a constant roller coaster; you're either going up or you're going down. Joshua Green On how Bannon's experience with angry video gamers later influenced his strategy as the head of Breitbart News After Goldman Sachs, [Bannon] wound up as the CEO of a video game company in Hong Kong that didn't actually produce video games, but what it did was to try and formalize a process called \"gold farming.\" And what that is, is literally they would hire people to play video games and win gold and prizes in the game that they would then turn around and sell to people in the real world so that they could be more powerful and more successful in these massive, multiplayer, online games like World of Warcraft. This was a serious business, it had backing from Goldman Sachs, and right out of the gate, it made a lot of money. But what happened next was interesting. The players in the actual games, who tended to be young males, bridled at the idea that people were essentially cheating, that they were buying these weapons and things to get ahead in the game, and the players themselves tended to congregate on these message boards that were devoted to [massive multiplayer games], and they organized themselves and they basically went after the video game companies and said, \"You need to stop this. You need to push out these gold farmers.\" And they had enough power that they basically ruined Bannon's business. But the lesson he took away from that was that these rootless white males who spend all their time online actually had what he told me was \"monster power\" to go out and [effect] change, and that they operated at a kind of sub-rosa level that most people didn't see. So when he moved over to Breitbart News a couple years later, one of his goals he told me was trying to track these people and radicalize them in a political sense, which is basically what wound up happening. On Bannon joining forces with anti-Clinton operatives Kellyanne Conway and David Bossie in the Trump campaign What was so interesting to me about the fact that Bannon and this group wound up in charge of Trump's campaign come mid-August was that they had really spent the previous 20-25 years as professional anti-Clinton operatives, which, believe it or not, is a distinct professional category within Republican politics. There's no real analog on the left \u2014 you can't make a living anymore as an anti-Obama operative or an anti-George W. Bush operative, but there's always an appetite among conservative donors, among conservative activists for anti-Clinton stuff, so you literally had people who had spent 20-25 years thinking and plotting about how to stop Hillary Clinton suddenly in charge of a half-a-billion-dollar presidential campaign led by a candidate who is more than willing to carry out those attacks. On the degree to which Trump subscribes to Bannon's belief system I think that Trump is driven mainly by opportunism, by a desire to pursue whatever is going to get Donald Trump positive coverage on cable news now. During the campaign when Bannon's nationalism seemed to work for him that's what he would espouse, but when that stopped working for him in February after he became president, he was happy to bring in people who nationalists abhor, people like Gary Cohn from Goldman Sachs. He was willing to listen to Jared Kushner and his daughter Ivanka, who are the furthest you can get from nationalists. So I don't know that Trump really has any policy beliefs at all.

The Federal Election Commission shows that 129 people have filed to run for president in the next election.\n                \n                    \n                    Annette Elizabeth Allen for NPR\n                    \n                \nhide caption The 2020 election cycle might have already started. The Federal Election Commission shows that 129 people have filed to run for president in the next election. There are way too many signs that the 2020 election is already beginning. -Here's a crazy stat: 129 people have already filed to run for president in 2020, as of Friday afternoon. In fairness, in 2016, more than 1,700 filed. But... -One of them is President Trump. He's not only already set up a reelection committee earlier maybe than anyone in history, but his campaign released the first ad of the 2020 cycle. Remarkably, it's touting what he's accomplished \u2014 in his first 100 days (!).There's already been a flap about stations not running it because of a falsehood in it. Trump's election may have been a threshold moment in presidential politics, opening the door for anyone to run or at least think about it, who might not have before. Becoming president is no longer about the ascendancy of current officerholders or lifelong public servants. That experience is no longer a prerequisite. Now, wealth, power and celebrity not only have a door open for access, but for the possibility of themselves being in charge. It's atypical for Washington and more like what's seen in Hollywood or major financial centers, like New York or London. It's, in part, the evolution of decades of disengagement from the American public, more interested in celebrity than the policy-wonk world of Washington. Presidential elections have become treated like reality shows, giving presidential candidates outsize attention compared to the actual power they have, while lower-level, closer-to-home elections and civic engagement get far less attention from voters and the media. The consequences of that are not yet known, but already what's emerged is activists dominating. For 2020, people are already taking steps to be part of the conversation. And the list below reflects the new reality. It's a who's who of politics, business and, yes, even one outright Hollywood actor with no political experience. -Facebook's Mark Zuckerberg was on a tractor, feeding baby cows, eating cheese curds, holding kittens, talking to cops, firemen and military leaders. He even ditched the hoodie for a suit in a black church. He posted it all to his Facebook page. Seriously. There's been plenty of speculation about Zuckerberg and campaign-like writings he's done recently. Asked by Buzzfeed if he has plans to run, he said, \"No.\" But when pressed if he'd explicitly rule it out, \"Zuckerberg did not immediately respond,\" Buzzfeed wrote. -He's not the only CEO being talked about \u2014 Disney's Bob Iger is reportedly being \"pelted with entreaties to run.\" His contract with Disney happens to expire in July 2019. Perfect timing. And... -When Howard Schultz stepped down as CEO of Starbucks in December, there was all kinds of speculation that he'd run for president (see: here, here, and here). In his farewell to his employees and investors, he talked of \"rising nationalism,\" \"shared values\" and the need to build \"a great and enduring America.\" He said: \"We're living in a fragile world. There's a need for more passionate government.\" In 2016, he told CNN, \"never say never\" to a run. -Former Vice President Joe Biden was in New Hampshire this week. \"Guys, I'm not running,\" he insisted. Maybe he just likes the spring foliage? Still, Biden's making lots of stops that are raising eyebrows \u2014 he's speaking at a Florida Democratic fundraiser, making several commencement speeches and said at a conference in San Diego: \"I don't plan on running, but everybody says because I won't commit that I will not run under any circumstances, that means I'm running.\" And remember, Biden teased tongue-in-cheek in December: \"I'm going to run in 2020 \u2014 for president. What the hell, man, anyway.\" -Elizabeth Warren has been on a book tour. She not only trash talked Republicans but Democrats, too. As for 2020, she told NPR's Audie Cornish, \"I don't have any plan to do that.\" No plans... OK. When Matt Lauer told her on NBC's Today Show that people are printing, \"She persisted\" bumper stickers, she just smiled and remained silent. -Bernie Sanders was also on tour with Democratic National Committee Chairman Tom Perez. He was mobbed by adoring fans, which he seemed to like, but there were some awkward moments that show he's still not quite willing to get in line with the establishment. -Kirsten Gillibrand, who replaced Hillary Clinton in the Senate, ruled out running in 2020. But is that ironclad? Asked about 2020 in Upstate New York, the New York senator said, \"Well, I'm dedicated to serving our state as our senator, and I'm running for re-election, so I can continue to be their senator.\" Asked if she's ruling it out, she said: \"I'm focused entirely on running for Senate, so yes, I'm ruling it out.\" What happens when or if that focus changes? Here's the thing: she needs to win reelection in 2018 before she could even think about going public with plans to run for president. She was rumored shortly after the 2016 election to be reaching out to Clinton donors. -Ohio Gov. John Kasich is also selling books. Asked on CNN if he's running for president again, Kasich said, \"No, no, no.\" Buuuut... \"You don't close the door on anything,\" he added. -Sen. Al Franken of Minnesota is also part of the book club. He has a book coming out at the end of the month, Al Franken, Giant of the Senate. Him running \"isn't as crazy as you might think\" and \"isn't a joke,\" others have written. There's already a \"Draft Franken 2020\" site. But he told a Minnesota radio show, \"First of all, I'm not running for president. I think that normally what senators do is to enter the presidential race, then lose very quickly and run for the Senate. That seems to be how it works.\" He bluntly said, \"No,\" he isn't running. Yet... his forceful questioning in hearings has raised his profile. \"It's very clear now that he is trying to raise his profile and position himself as a leading critic of Donald Trump,\" Jim Manley, a former top aide to former Majority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nev., told The Hill. -The Rock, yes, The Rock, is on the cover of National Review as \"The Celebrity We Need,\" written by someone else who almost ran for president in 2016. And before you dismiss a celebrity actor formerly involved with wrestling, look at the current occupant of 1600 Pennsylvania Ave. Want to get this issue with @TheRock online as soon as it's available? Subscribe: https://t.co/KwdagS9a7u pic.twitter.com/plNjVqthGW -Colorado Gov. John Hickenlooper told NPR's Wait Wait Don't Tell Me game show that he might be open to a run. \"Two years from now, if everyone else is running, then we'll see,\" he said. -Cory Booker wants it. -Hillary Clinton is setting up a PAC and writing a book. But no one expects she'd run. This week, though, she noted how close she was to winning. -Michelle Obama is super popular. But she says no chance she's running. \"No, No. No,\" she told Oprah. \"Look, that's one thing I don't do, I don't make stuff up, I'm not coy. I haven't proven that. I'm pretty direct \u2014 if I were interested in it, I'd say it. I don't believe in playing games. ... People don't really understand how hard this is. And it's not something you cavalierly ask a family to do again.\" OK, that sounds pretty definitive. -Chelsea Clinton seems a little closer to it. Her Twitter feed has been pretty political since Trump was sworn in, including this week with the passage of the House GOP health care bill. But, she said, \"If someone steps down or something changes, I'll answer those questions at that time. But right now, no, I'm not running for public office ... Period.\" Right now... -Tom Cotton, the fiery Arkansas Republican, has already been to Iowa. \"Iowa, there's nothing normal about Bible-believing Christians being tarred as bigots because they simply want to live their faith in their day-to-day life,\" he said. Although that was three weeks before the 2016 presidential election. With Trump winning, he's probably more thinking 2024 at this point. -Rep. Jason Chaffetz, R-Utah, might be running in 2020 \u2014 for governor. He isn't running for reelection in 2018. But forget 2020 for president, he's already thinking longer term. He's already bought up Jason2028.com. American elections are already too long, so why wouldn't it become the case that they bleed all the way into the first few months of a new presidency? TV news ratings and Web traffic spike in presidential years and fall off in off-years and midterm elections. Presidential turnout rates are far higher in presidential years than in midterms. On average, since 1980, the U.S. has seen a 29 percent drop from presidential elections to midterm elections, and it's been on the rise. As it is, the U.S. lags far behind other Western democracies in voter participation \u2014 even in presidential years. But there's a danger in this. The American presidency is limited \u2014 by design. And yet, presidential elections are given outsize prominence to the detriment of policies that could affect real people's lives and important lower-level elections. Americans just aren't as interested in civic participation as they are celebrity. That means that when policies are pushed only a moneyed few with access can have quiet influence in Washington. And it means that activists can control the levers of power locally, which trickle up to power nationally in forms like gerrymandering in redistricting. Politics is hard, and it can be annoying, but being disconnected from it has consequences. And the kinds of people who could become president is one of them.",

Could a real shake-up be coming soon to the Trump White House \u2014 and is his chief strategist Steve Bannon the one on the outs? The president sounds fed up with the infighting, and he appears to be picking sides \u2014 predictably with his family. In an interview with the New York Post's Michael Goodwin, Trump seems to push away Bannon. \"I like Steve, but you have to remember, he was not involved in my campaign until very late,\" Trump said. \"I had already beaten all the senators and all the governors, and I didn't know Steve. I'm my own strategist, and it wasn't like I was going to change strategies because I was facing crooked Hillary.\" That is brutal. Bannon, the former head of the right-wing website Breitbart with a very particular world view, was brought on in August of 2016 and named the campaign's \"CEO.\" He was kept on when Trump won the presidency as White House chief strategist and has been seen as an inspirational leader for Trump \u2014 populist, nativist and anti-globalist. Bannon's fingerprints are everywhere, from Trump's \"America First\" doctrine to the dark vision laid out in his inaugural address. He even put himself on the Principals Committee of the National Security Council, an unprecedented and unusual step for the president's top political strategist. But Bannon clashed with the wrong person, Trump's son-in-law Jared Kushner. Kushner enjoys a broad portfolio in the White House and, most importantly, influence with Trump. He's married to Trump's elder daughter, Ivanka, who always has her father's ear \u2014 and now a West Wing office, too. She reportedly is \"angrier than anyone.\" Don't misread this - Ivanka Trump angrier than anyone over current events, per multiple sources  https://t.co/f14f8uErhG The president ordered Kushner and Bannon to sit down and work things out Friday at Mar-a-Lago. Trump confirmed that to Goodwin, and in the process, may have revealed which side he's on. \"Steve is a good guy,\" the president said, \"but I told them to straighten it out or I will.\" It's never good when your boss says you're a \"good guy, but ... .\" It's a remarkable turn of events for someone like Bannon, who seemed to rise in Trump's orbit quickly, only to, like Icarus, have his wings melt away when he got too close to the sun. Steeped in controversy Bannon has always been a controversial figure, having touted Breitbart as \"the platform for the alt-right,\" which is closely aligned with white nationalism. The Trump campaign had difficulty balancing the fact that white nationalism, and white supremacists, were supportive of Trump and the need to push back against them publicly. Trump's campaign team, even after the election, angrily denied that it had given a boost to racists. But Trump's campaign and he himself repeatedly (his team says unwittingly) retweeted or used alt-right memes. Now Bannon's influence has taken a hit, especially when it comes to foreign policy and the Trump administration's recent airstrike in Syria. Trump's new national security adviser, Army Lt. Gen. Henry McMaster, ousted Bannon from the NSC; Trump speaks regularly with Defense Secretary James Mattis; and Rex Tillerson is resurgent, meeting with his counterpart in Russia on Wednesday. Trump appears to be moving away from the rigid ideology of Bannon's grandiosity and more toward a more traditional Republican posture \u2014 and the alt-right doesn't like it. As Bannon fight goes public, Kushner faces rise in anti-Semitism As the Kushner-Bannon rivalry percolated in the media for a few days, the Anti-Defamation League issued a press release Monday headlined, \"Explosive Growth of Hateful Memes and Anti-Semitic Conspiracy Theories Against Jared Kushner.\" The ADL wrote: \"This campaign of anti-Semitism has been driven by white supremacists and anti-Semites and has all the hallmarks of classic Jewish conspiracy theories. The narratives include accusations that Jews in the Trump Administration are trying to start a war to advance the interests of Israel. They contend that Trump has abandoned his 'America First' policy, which the alt right supported, because he is being manipulated by Kushner and other Jewish advisors.\" Kushner is Jewish. Reporters and those who spoke out against Trump during the campaign reported repeated online harassment. The ADL noted the use of hashtags on Twitter like #firekushner, #kushnerswar and #Syriahoax, which began to appear a week ago. Trump's comments to the New York Post also come amid a backlash aimed at White House press secretary Sean Spicer, who on Passover Tuesday said Syria's Bashar Assad was worse than Hitler, because Hitler didn't use chemical weapons \"on his own people.\" Spicer apologized (apparently to GOP mega-donor Sheldon Adelson as well), but it's not his first flub. Given Trump's comments about Bannon, you wonder if he's in an itchy mood and looking to shake things up all around as the 100-day mark approaches. No president uses one press secretary for his entire presidency. President Obama had three over eight years (two in his first term); George W. Bush and Bill Clinton both had four (and also two in their first terms). Don't mess with the family In the campaign, Trump had seemed taken with Bannon's verve and willingness to fight. His confrontational tactics appealed to Trump and played into the machismo he was offering up at packed rallies on the campaign trail. It was Bannon, you might remember, who ordered up the bringing of Bill Clinton's former accusers of sexual misconduct to a national debate. They held a mock press conference beforehand and got close-up seats to the debate. All the while, Bannon, who shied away from media interviews, stood on the sidelines. Trump's \"lock her up\" base ate it up. But Bannon's influence began to be scrutinized. Three weeks into Trump's presidency, Time magazine put him on its cover as \"The Great Manipulator\" and asked if he was \"the second most powerful man in the world.\" Stories touting Bannon's influence and leaks against Kushner or Ivanka Trump apparently rankled the president. Bannon should have learned that while his tactics might appeal to Trump, he should never direct his efforts at Trump's family. Remember, a family meeting was partially responsible for Corey Lewandowski's firing as campaign manager in the primaries. \"[Corey] knew there was a battle brewing. I am certain he thought he would win,\" a source told NPR last summer. Lewandowski lost. The source described the \"weekly Monday morning family meeting\" as a \"summary execution.\" For years, Bannon made his money in Hollywood. Well, as Michael told Fredo in The Godfather: \"Don't ever take sides with anyone against the family again. Ever.\" Of course, the wild card here is this: If Bannon is eventually ousted, does he train Breitbart's sights on Trump?",

Local media are reporting high turnout in the country's national elections. Dutch voters are choosing a new government Wednesday, in parliamentary elections that right-wing politician Geert Wilders \u2014 aka \"the Dutch Donald Trump\" \u2014 hopes will put his Freedom Party in power. The vote is seen as a test of the power of populist nationalism, which won key votes in Britain and the U.S. High voter turnout was reported by local media in the first hours of voting, with 33 percent of voters hitting the polls by 1:45 p.m. local time, according to public broadcaster NOS. The last polls are scheduled to close at 9 p.m. \u2014 4 p.m. ET here in the U.S. \u2014 and the tabulation will begin. The Dutch vote is being watched closely in Europe \u2014 particularly because Wilders has pledged to take the Netherlands out of the EU. The vote also comes before national elections in France and Germany, where right-wing candidates are eyeing gains. After voting in The Hague, Prime Minister Mark Rutte addressed camera crews and urged voters to reject Wilders, asking the Dutch public to think about how a Freedom Party win would look. \"I think the rest of the world will then see that after Brexit, after the American elections, again the wrong sort of populism has won the day,\" he said, according to the BBC. When Wilders voted around an hour earlier, he told reporters, \"Whatever the outcome of the election today, the genie will not go back into the bottle.\" Wilders' party was among the leaders in opinion polls, riding a wave of concerns about migrants and Muslims. The Freedom Party slipped in the last round of polls before today's vote \u2014 but we'll note that polls in both Britain and the U.S. proved unreliable in the face of strong voter sentiment. Rutte and his ruling Liberal Party are among the 13 parties that hope to win seats and set the national agenda by either picking a leader outright or forming a coalition government. In recent appearances, Wilders has been seen wearing a bulletproof vest. As NPR's Frank Langfitt has reported, \"Al-Qaida and ISIS have threatened to kill him.\" Here's how Frank lays out Wilders' strategy: \"Wilders, who's been compared to Trump by the Dutch press and some voters, is a colorful figure, known for his bleached-blond pompadour and extreme rhetoric. He has been running an anti-Islam, anti-immigrant 'Holland First'-style campaign and has vowed to 'make the Netherlands ours again.' \" Saying that Wilders appeals to \"a broad range of people,\" from older voters to those who feel immigration threatens to take away their livelihoods, a Dutch political analyst discussed the people who've swayed elections in Britain and the U.S. \u2014 and are now giving Wilders momentum: \"I think they're exactly the same people. They are people who not necessarily are poor, but actually have a lot to lose. Trump voters, they earned over $70,000 per annum. You see a large part of the Wilders vote, they're earning a lot of money. Most of them earn more this year than last year, but they feel that they might lose everything. So, it's not what they have, it's what they think they might lose.\"",

            "article_content": "Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi's party won big in local elections. About 60 percent voted and women turned out in higher rates than men.  LAKSHMI SINGH, HOST: In state elections in India, Prime Minister Narendra Modi moved closer to consolidating power over the world's biggest democracy today. Elections have been going on in India for five weeks, and the Prime Minister's Bharatiya Janata Party also known as the BJP scored landslide victories. NPR's Julie McCarthy joins us from New Delhi to talk about what these results mean. Julie, what happened today? JULIE MCCARTHY, BYLINE: Well, there were five states where legislative assemblies were up for grabs, and there are sort of a geographical cross-section which provides a national glimpse of what voters might be thinking. We had Manipur in the east, Goa in the west, Uttarakhand, Punjab and Uttar Pradesh in the north. And the BJP is forming the government's in four out of five of those states. SINGH: What makes the latest state elections so much more significant? MCCARTHY: Well, you know, for one thing, they quiet what has been a pretty huge debate here in India. The eyes of the world were looking at New Delhi last year over a controversial cash crunch that Modi created. He ordered all high value banknotes pulled from circulation. It was supposed to force people who had hidden unreported cash to deposit it, own up and pay the tax man. For weeks, there wasn't enough cash in circulation, and people were miserable. But, Lakshmi, this does not seem to have mattered at all in this election. And Modi can claim that the people were with him. SINGH: Julie, tell me a little bit about the turnout. What was that like? Who voted? MCCARTHY: Well, there was about 60 percent vote, and the remarkable thing is that more women in all five of these states voted than men did. And three of these five states are in northern India - right? - where there's entrenched conservative views about women from discrimination against women in marriage, divorce, education. But this turnout reflects the fact that women are being educated and increasingly aware of their rights. And they force parties to talk about the issues they care about - safety, better health, better transportation, less sexual discrimination. And so the women now have a bigger say in making officials accountable. SINGH: Just looking forward, what do these state elections mean overall in the long term? MCCARTHY: I'm not sure these state elections really represent pushing out of policy beyond the borders of India. What they do do is combine cumulatively - you're going to find yourself pretty soon in the year 2019 where there will be national elections. And if Modi has a head wind behind him, he will be emboldened to be a more active player on the world stage, to see how he can deepen relations with the people and the countries around him. So I would look for that area certainly to be more developed. SINGH: Because we remind listeners that Modi was a once widely seen as a polarizing figure, right? MCCARTHY: Oh, yes, he was. And many still consider him to be a polarizing figure. You know, his critics say he's a self-declared Hindu nationalist, and that often was couched in terms of promoting Hindus and often demeaning the Muslim community. So they're always very watchful when Modi's on the campaign trail to see if that Hindu nationalism will rear its head. It did slightly in this campaign, but it wasn't the overall message. And now that Modi has drawn a support from the Hindu community, from the Muslim community who are often at different sides of the aisle, it allows his party to say, look, Modi is a unifying force. He's not a polarizing one, which is a very important message to project to the world, let alone the people inside this country. SINGH: That's NPR's Julie McCarthy. Julie, thank you.

Trump uses Boeing as an example of his \"America First\" policies, but the plane parts come from all over. President Trump and his advisers have begun putting some red meat on the bones of the president's \"America First\" agenda. Trump is expected to talk more about that when he addresses a joint session of Congress on Tuesday night. As with Brexit and other nationalist movements, Trump sees his election as part of a broader rejection of globalization. \"Erasing national borders does not make people safer or more prosperous,\" Trump told supporters in Melbourne, Fla., this month. \"It undermines democracy and trades away prosperity. We're giving it away.\" That philosophy not only guides the president's policies on immigration and national security, it is also steering an economic agenda that plays well with many of Trump's most ardent supporters. \"A lot of people here are pro-America and looking to support a president that finally says, 'I'm for you, the working man,'\" said rally attendee James Evert. \"His No. 1 concern is Americans. Not for all the other people around the world.\" But turning nationalistic slogans into practice is easier said than done, as Trump discovered on one of his first days in office. During a discussion of restarting two stalled pipelines, Trump insisted his commerce secretary look for ways to include more American materials. \"It comes from the United States or we're not building it,\" Trump told an audience of conservative activists last week. The actual order is not quite so clear-cut. It includes considerable wiggle room if the \"buy American\" provision turns out to be impractical or runs afoul of international trade rules. Some people welcome the president's push. \"I thought, it's about time,\" said Scott Paul, president of the Alliance for American Manufacturing, a partnership between the steelworkers union and domestic steel companies. Thousands of steel jobs have been lost in recent years, partly as a result of cheap Chinese imports. Paul said those idle steelworkers would be happy to go back to work making pipes. But first, their employers will have to be convinced that Trump's mandate has staying power. \"It's kind of the chicken-and-egg thing,\" Paul said. \"U.S. steelmakers are not going to open up lines to make massive amounts of pipes if they don't think pipes are going to be in demand. But once they know there is going to be a market, this is a product the steel industry will be eager to deliver.\" Likewise, Trump has been pressing automakers to locate more assembly plants in the U.S. But that may overlook what's under the hood. Carmaking is a business that increasingly crosses national borders. Many American automakers rely heavily on imported parts, while many foreign companies employ workers here in the U.S. \"The No. 1 American-made car was the Toyota Camry,\" said senior editor Kelsey Mays of the website Cars.com, which compiles an annual index of the most \"American-made\" models. \"That may surprise some people because Toyota obviously isn't based here in the United States. But the Camry has 75 percent domestic content. It's built in Georgetown, Ky., and Lafayette, Ind.,\" Mays says. In fact, the five most American-made models on the Cars.com list last year all had Japanese nameplates. The biggest disconnect between Trump's narrow brand of nationalism and the reality of global supply chains showed up when the president visited a Boeing plant earlier this month to celebrate the rollout of a new 787 Dreamliner. \"This plane, as you know, was built right here in the great state of South Carolina,\" Trump said. \"Our goal as a nation must be to rely less on imports and more on products made here in the U.S.A.\" While Boeing is an American company, the Dreamliner is a melting pot. Its fuselage comes from Italy. The wings are from Japan. Passenger doors are built in France. What's more, 85 percent of the planes are sold overseas. \"You've got a plane that's heavily sourced from abroad and overwhelmingly goes to international customers,\" said aviation consultant Richard Aboulafia of the Teal Group. \"This is a poster child for globalization.\" Big exporters like Boeing would have a big target on their backs if Trump's protectionist policies end up starting a trade war. In a way, it's odd that Trump would choose to give an \"America First\" speech while standing in front of a newly assembled Dreamliner. With its 6,400-mile range, the widebody jet is built to carry people quickly and easily across oceans and between continents. That flight could be bumpy with a new nationalistic president at the controls.",

The band released its full-length debut, Nothing Feels Natural, in the early weeks of 2017.\n                \n                    \n                    Katie Alice Greer/Courtesy of the artist\n                    \n                \nhide caption Katie Alice Greer of Washington, D.C.'s Priests. The band released its full-length debut, Nothing Feels Natural, in the early weeks of 2017. In music and the culture it reflects, 2017 was predictably unpredictable: idols fell, empires shook, consensus was scarce. This conversation is one of five on The Record with artists, makers and thinkers whose work captured something unique about a chaotic year, and hinted at bigger revelations around the bend. When music moves us, it's often because it helps us to understand ourselves, articulating things about our lives that we can't quite figure out how to say. The flipside to that introspection can be equally powerful: music that helps us understand things larger than ourselves, exposing us to the world outside our bubbles. It is especially precious \u2014 and instructive \u2014 when we find music that does both at once. As Katie Alice Greer, singer and lyricist for the Washington, D.C. band Priests, puts it, \"Music, or any kind of art, creates this emotional thread that can connect all kinds of seemingly disparate issues \u2014 from very large-scale, community, civic aspects to very small thoughts that you have before you go to sleep at night, that you don't tell anybody.\" That emotional thread lights up Priests' full-length debut, Nothing Feels Natural, released in the early weeks of 2017 and included on our list of the year's best albums. It's a sharp collection of punk songs tinged with funk, new-wave and experimental leanings, and filled with lyrics that Greer says she hopes \"speak to very huge things in a small way.\" Often, that means considering what life-shaping forces like nationalism, sexism and gentrification can do to us on a day-to-day level. It's one thing to say that capitalism strengthens itself by convincing us to shape our personal identities around the products we buy, and another to sing, as Greer admits on the single \"JJ,\" \"I thought I was a cowboy because I smoked Reds.\" Priests has a reputation as a political band, one Greer says it didn't ask for and can't quite shake. It didn't help that Nothing Feels Natural came out just a week after Donald Trump stood at the center of the band's beloved hometown and was sworn in as president (\"People couldn't write about anything we did without talking about the inauguration\"). On its past singles and EPs, Priests has taken explicit aim at consumer culture, elected officials and the American project in general \u2014 but Greer maintains that the question of whether her band, or any band, is political is missing the point. What's more important to Priests, she says, is to demonstrate the ways power is embedded in everything. At the end of a year defined by divisiveness, I spoke with Greer about how she integrates these perspectives into her lyrics, and why she thinks labels like \"political art\" can hinder more important conversations about what actions count as political, what place art deserves in society and what it takes to identify as an artist. Marissa Lorusso: Could you tell me about the experience of releasing Nothing Feels Natural, which took several years to write and record, at this very pivotal and intense political moment? I imagine that had an impact on the way people received it and talked to you about it. Katie Alice Greer: Absolutely. It's that sort of yes-and-no thing: No, we didn't write it about this \u2014 but yes, sort of, we did. Because we've been talking about these sorts of things that finally led to the horrible place that we are in nationally right now. We've been about that all along. There's a song that's a little more surreal and absurd \u2014 and, to me, funny \u2014 on our EP called \"And Breeding\" that ends with the line \"Barack Obama killed something in me and I'm going to get him for it.\" I remember people used to kind of side-eye that lyric: \"What do you mean by that? He's the greatest!\" And while he certainly seems a million times better than our current president, there were still a lot of problems with Barack Obama's administration: We were still an imperialist country dropping bombs on brown people overseas. We still had the prison-industrial complex that literally murders hundreds of thousands of people every year. You know, we were still the f*****-up country that we are now. I've seen you push back a lot on descriptions of Priests as political music. Could you explain to me what it is about that terminology that doesn't fit to you? To me, it seems like it does a disservice to people who are writing more topical protest songs. We're good friends with Downtown Boys, and the way that our bands approach songwriting in terms of content is pretty different. There's other bands who are trying to tackle, head-on, some specific issues. I think a lot of times, what we're trying to do more is tie in a certain emotionality to the experiences that plenty of us have in our everyday lives. It's just very lazy, I think, to call any music \"political\" and not really expand on what you're talking about. ... I got frustrated recently because I read a new interview \u2014 it was with some kids for a writing class, so I'm not actually frustrated \u2014 where we were having this similar conversation with them. They ended up writing about it as, like, \"Priests will be the first to tell you that they're not a political band.\" No! No, no, no. It's more like: To us, everything is political. It's what we keep repeating to people. Do you wish people asked more specific questions about the politics behind your music? Yeah, I do wish people would get a little more specific. If you think it is political, talk to me about that. A very politicized issue that we've taken on is the diminishing space for the importance of art in society. The music industry exists, but you see a lot more of the industry side than the music side. I think you could probably say that about any industry of art. Can you explain what you mean by that \u2014 seeing more of the industry side than the art side? Decisions are made that benefit the bottom dollar more than they are taking consideration of artistic ideas. I think a more healthy culture would really deeply respect artists for the incredibly vital visions that they bring to the table. I'm very excited about the new Bjork record, called Utopia. She's given interviews talking about how, as an artist, she feels it's important to be presenting people with a vision for the future. A healthy society would appreciate that kind of work that Bjork is contributing, rather than her celebrity or something like that. Especially in a time like this \u2014 this year, everyone is incredibly freaked out and probably, in a sense, grieving over this uncertain future that we have and what might be going on in our country. I just see less and less of a place for art in all its different forms in society and that, to me, points to a culture that is taking a further direction towards fascism, where free speech is not encouraged. Or gets confused \u2014 like when people do talk about hate speech, it's just Nazis talking about their right to spew hate. I've been visiting the Kennedy Center a lot recently to see some of their free programming. And while JFK, there were plenty of issues with his administration, too, it's so surreal to be in this gorgeous building named after a president that people thought really cared about the arts and made that a priority of his administration. It's just so absurd when you compare it to what the Trump administration seems to think about the funding that the NEA needs. With women musicians, I often want to hear about their experiences as women \u2014 but I also want them to have the chance to talk about their craft in a way that's not totally hemmed in by their gender. That feels analogous to the role of politics in your band: I'm sure you feel compelled to speak to that aspect, but you might also want to talk about making a record and the challenges of songwriting and performing. Absolutely. We want to talk about being artists. We want to talk about being musicians. But that is more difficult for people to wrap their heads around. I also think there's something that feels pretentious or embarrassing to some people to hear people talk about themselves that way. As artists, you mean? Yeah, totally. There are plenty of people who are like, \"You're just a f****** person in a band; stop calling yourself an artist, you self-important dummy.\" But to me, that's just a symptom of a culture that does not respect the power of art the way that a healthy culture should. So  it's taken a long time to have social conversations about sexism and racism and homophobia and transphobia, and it's wonderful that we're able to have those conversations right now. [But] everyone is like, \"Yeah, and you're a woman artist!\" It's like, \"Yes. Also, we have brown hair.\" It's not the same thing, obviously, because misogyny is hatred of women, and that influences most of our lives; there's no widespread brown hair hatred. But you just want these conversations to be a little bit more nuanced. Again, for writers, when you write about something that's a little more complicated, it's harder for people to engage with that. It's harder to keep your audience. The same thing goes for musicians: People want to complain about how music isn't interesting or challenging enough, but we don't have a culture that rewards asking your audience to think critically, no matter what kind of artistic field you work in. I would really love for us to turn into a culture that asks one another to think critically, instead of coercing each other into doing things by force. This idea of a diminishing space for art, as you put it, and the way that so much art seems driven by capitalism, has been around for a long time. My guess is you'd say Priests has been tackling these topics since well before the 2016 election. Right. And we've kind of taken a step back from that. I think it's because we recognize that we exist in capitalism. We recognize that the problems that you and I are talking about right now are a product of capitalism, and so we recognize that, to a certain extent, you don't get to opt out of having a personal brand. That's kind of thrust upon you, whether or not you want it. But there are certain people who are learning the performative language of, let's say, \"politics with a capital P,\" and are performing that because they recognize that it's trendy and it will sell right now. And that's not really something that we're interested in. Do you feel there's an attitude that those issues began with this administration? Is it frustrating to say, \"We've been talking about this stuff for years?\" As a person, sure. Not so much from a band perspective. I feel like people who identify as a capital-L liberal \u2014 which, I don't personally identify that way \u2014 are like, \"This is not the country that I once knew.\" Yes it is! It absolutely is. And I hope that those people are taking a long, hard look at how certain privileges masked the reality of our country to them for a long time, until this year, and how maybe that is part of the problem. We've always been really insistent on not making art that feels like propaganda, where you're kind of having the facts thrust upon you. To us, the importance of art and its power is presenting people with something captivating on a pedestal, and letting them come to it on their own and wrestle with it, or sort of surrender attention to it. It should be like a magnet that pulls you towards it, not something that's taking you by the collar and pointing a finger at you like, \"This is reality!\" You should be the one constructing that for yourself.",

Gandhi takes over the party leadership this week from his mother, Sonia Gandhi, who steps down after nearly two decades as the head of the party the Nehru-Gandhi family has dominated for 70 years. Rahul Gandhi, the 47-year-old scion of India's Nehru-Gandhi family, takes the helm of the National Congress Party this week, raising questions about the potency of the political opposition in the world's biggest democracy. Rahul succeeds his mother, Sonia Gandhi, 71, who steps down amid concerns of ill health, and ends a record 19 years as party president. The Indian National Congress party once controlled almost the entire country. As the beleaguered opposition today, it's been losing state election after election since Prime Minister Narendra Modi and his Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) swept to power in May 2014. The two parties lock horns this week in a closely watched contest in Modi's state of Gujarat to elect a new assembly. But will the generational shift signal a change in fortune for the lackluster opposition? What's at stake for India if the main opposition continues to be enfeebled? Rahul Gandhi is seen as a sweet-tempered young man, but a neophyte, more party mascot than savvy political boss. It's been said that he has neither the charisma of his grandmother, Indira Gandhi, nor the intellect of his great-grandfather, Jawaharlal Nehru, India's first prime minister. Gandhi, who officially takes over on Saturday, will face the daunting task of restoring the glory \u2014 and even relevance \u2014 of the party at a time of turmoil in India. Social activist Harsh Mander says that under the leadership of Modi \u2014 a self-proclaimed Hindu nationalist \u2014 and the BJP, India \"is passing through a very difficult time.\" One of the biggest challenges for the opposition, Mander says, is combating repression of dissent, and curbing a growing \"permissive climate of hate.\" Dozens of violent incidents, including murder, have been carried out in the name of protecting the cow, which the country's Hindus consider a holy animal. Mander says in the face of such intimidation, it's critical for the opposition to find its voice. While he says he's willing to give Rahul Gandhi a chance, he worries that he will \"continue to be advised to be cautious\" and pursue a more ambiguous stand. Gandhi has been criticized for playing to the BJP's Hindutva strengths, paying visits to an unusual number of Hindu temples during the campaign in Gujarat. Gandhi was the only candidate for the party's top post, a nomination he won unanimously. Critics condemn the Congress party's dynastic character; Modi rode to office deriding the party as out of touch and undemocratic, and handed Congress the biggest loss in its 132-year history. Modi on Monday wished Rahul a \"fruitful tenure\" as the sixth Gandhi to become president of the Congress party. Last week, he declared, \"Those who have no internal democracy can't work for [the] people.\" But Neelanjan Sircar, a senior fellow at the Centre for Policy Research in New Delhi, says the Congress party has no real mechanism to move ground level leaders up the ranks. In addition, he says competing factions within the Congress party could tear it apart. Although Gandhi may not be ideal, Sircar says it may be difficult to hold the party together without him. But expecting a relatively young Gandhi to be a magnet for the youth vote may disappoint. Many of India's young reject politics that smacks of elitism and exclusion. Inheriting political office or consolidating power around one family offends their sense of meritocracy. Yet others point out that dynastic politics are hardly limited to the Congress party: The Samajwadi Party that until recently governed Uttar Pradesh, the largest state in India, deployed dynastic practices to field family members in contested seats at election time. Nilanjan Mukhopadhyay, author of Narendra Modi: The Man, The Times, calls dynastic rule a \"remnant of the feudal culture,\" that is alive and well. Why grill only Congress he asks. Rahul Gandhi has been sharpening his skills for the thrust and parry of Indian politics. While he can't compete with Modi's oratory, The Mint newspaper reports that despite no ground game in Gujarat, the Congress Party has \"emerged as a contender.\" It is Modi's BJP that appears nervous. Still, Neelanjan Sircar of the Centre for Policy Research says the opposition is failing to frame adequate answers to fundamental questions. \"This is an ugly time,\" Sircar says, \"there is no way of sugarcoating it.\" He says the BJP, for example, promotes a notion of nationhood that relies heavily on a Hindu identity. Commentator Shekhar Gupta sees \"unapologetic, overt religiosity\" melding with a new nationalism. Sircar says the opposition Congress party, which is secular, is not even debating an alternate conception of what it means to be Indian. It's only reacting to actions that undermine India as a secular state. Meanwhile, he points out that some opposition politicians privately admit they won't appear alongside Muslim leaders for fear it will politically harm them. \"The idea that politicians are now afraid to represent a secular identity, says something about where we are as a country,\" says Sircar. What it says is that Modi's BJP has managed to frame the terms of the national debate, and the Congress party opposition needs to enter its new era asserting a compelling and countervailing vision.",

Al Green, D-Texas, introduced a resolution to impeach President Trump, but Democratic leaders joined the vote to table the motion.\n                \n                    \n                    Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption Rep. Al Green, D-Texas, introduced a resolution to impeach President Trump, but Democratic leaders joined the vote to table the motion. Updated 2:51 p.m. ET Texas Democrat Al Green forced a House vote on the impeachment of President Trump on Wednesday, but a broad bipartisan majority voted down the effort. Green introduced two articles of impeachment against Trump. The articles did not include any charges related to Justice Department special counsel Robert Mueller's investigation, which has led to criminal charges against four Trump aides. Instead, Green's impeachment articles focused on divisive statements and actions by Trump, including his defense of racist protests and violence in Charlottesville, Va.; derisive comments about National Football League national anthem protests; and recent retweets of videos posted by a far-right nationalist British group, among other things. Trump, Green said on the House floor on Wednesday afternoon, has \"undermined the integrity of his office and has sown discord among the people of the United States.\" Whether or not Trump has committed any crimes, Green argued, is irrelevant to the discussion. \"The question isn't whether we have a bigot as President, the question is: What are we going to do about it?\" Green wrote in a letter to fellow lawmakers ahead of the vote. \"The answer is: impeachment for his high misdemeanors, which need not be a crime.\" The effort failed on a 364-58 vote, with four Democrats voting present. House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi and Minority Whip Steny Hoyer sided with Republicans in tabling Green's articles. Among the higher-ranking Democrats voting in favor of impeachment: Assistant Democratic Leader Jim Clyburn and Minnesota Rep. Keith Ellison, who serves as vice chairman of the Democratic National Committee. In a joint statement issued shortly after Green introduced his impeachment articles on the House floor, Pelosi and Hoyer rejected Green's argument. \"Legitimate questions have been raised about [Trump's] fitness to lead this nation,\" they wrote, but added that \"right now, Congressional committees continue to be deeply engaged in investigations into the President's actions both before and after his inauguration. The special counsel's investigation is moving forward as well, and those inquiries should be allowed to continue. Now is not the time to consider articles of impeachment.\" Green argued that regardless of the various investigations' findings, Trump's actions and statements have met the political bar for removal from office. \"Impeachment is a political remedy, not a judicial remedy, thus it may be a high misdemeanor, which may or may not be a crime,\" he wrote. Green cites the impeachment of President Andrew Johnson, which has been viewed historically as an overtly partisan act. Green's step widens a growing rift within the Democratic Party and its progressive base: whether to publicly call for the impeachment of an unpopular president at the center of an ongoing criminal investigation. And, if so, at what volume and urgency to call for that impeachment. Most House Democrats want nothing to do with impeachment efforts right now and worry that publicly backing them as Mueller's investigation continues would make any eventual impeachment push look partisan. \"Electing a president of the United States is the most important act American citizens take in setting the policies of their country. That should not be overturned except for the most egregious and demonstrable facts,\" Hoyer recently told reporters. \"Do we disagree with [Trump's] policies? We do. But disagreeing with the policies is not enough to overturn an election \u2014 a free and fair election \u2014 of the American people.\" It's not just entrenched leaders like Hoyer and Pelosi who feel that way. \"Here's what I say to my colleagues: If a Republican were to say that they were never going to vote to impeach Trump no matter what Bob Mueller found, we would say that's totally unreasonable,\" said California Rep. Ro Khanna, a progressive freshman representing Silicon Valley. \"You have to look at the evidence. Similarly, there's no way we should be saying that we could vote for impeachment without the end of Mueller's findings. Let's wait to see what he's going to do. Let him finish his job.\" Still, a growing number of Democratic voters and activists appear ready to not only call for impeachment now, but also to make that call a central part of the 2018 midterm election. California Democratic megadonor and activist Tom Steyer has sunk at least $10 million into an online petition effort urging Trump's impeachment. He has already gathered more than 3.3 million signatures. \"Impeachment is really about a president breaking his trust with the Constitution, with the American people,\" Steyer told NPR. Steyer is running glossy national television ads on cable to promote the effort, raising questions about whether he is using the impeachment push to raise his profile ahead of a run for office. \"The criteria has already been met\" for impeachment, Steyer contended, citing Trump's firing of FBI Director James Comey \u2013 and Comey's testimony that Trump had asked the director to \"go easy\" on Flynn. He added, \"The other thing that's going on though is not just whether he has met the criteria to be impeached, but also the huge threat that he presents to the American people, which means why there's the urgency for us to act. And that's what we're really trying to do. We're trying to give Americans a voice where they say, 'This president is a threat to us.' \" See below for a summary from Green's office of the articles he introduced: Summary of Articles of Impeachment Article I \u2013 Associating the Presidency with White Nationalism, Neo-Nazism and Hatred \u2022 Donald J. Trump issued a public statement characterizing anti-Semites, bigots, racists, white nationalists, and Ku Klux Klansmen who rallied in Charlottesville, Va., as \"very fine people.\" \u2022 Donald J. Trump did not issue a public statement when these hate groups returned to Charlottesville, Va., chanting \"You will not replace us!\" He did, however, issue several statements related to players in the National Football League exercising their constitutionally protected right to protest. \u2022 Donald J. Trump shared three videos from a British right-wing extremist that purported to show various violent acts committed by Muslims. The videos were found to be inaccurately titled and characterized. Article II \u2013 Inciting Hatred and Hostility \u2022 Donald J. Trump issued Executive Order 13769, which caused a partial shutdown of immigration from Muslim countries. \u2022 Donald J. Trump issued a public statement that transgender individuals are banned from serving in the United States military. \u2022 Donald J. Trump made a public statement referring to professional football players as \"sons of bitches,\" therefore denigrating them and their mothers, for exercising their constitutionally protected right to protest. \u2022 Donald J. Trump made a public statement that after being devastated by a Category 4 and Category 5 hurricane, Puerto Ricans \"... want everything done for them when it should be a community effort,\" inciting racial tensions around the stereotype that people of color need or want handouts. \u2022 Donald J. Trump made a public statement that after being devastated by a Category 4 and Category 5 hurricane in one week, Puerto Ricans had \"... thrown our budget a little out of whack.\" Similar statements were not made by Mr. Trump about Texas or Florida, which were also devastated by hurricanes. \u2022 Donald J. Trump issued a public statement referring to Rep. Frederica Wilson (D-FL-24), a female, African-American Member of Congress as \"wacky\" and called her a liar. \u2022 Donald J. Trump issued a public statement referring to Rep. Frederica Wilson (D-FL-24), a female, African-American Member of Congress as \"wacky\" a second time. \u2022 Donald J. Trump issued a public statement referring to Rep. Frederica Wilson (D-FL-24), a female, African-American Member of Congress as \"wacky\" a third time.",

Since leaving the president's staff Bannon is spearheading an effort to take on the GOP establishment. Former Trump chief strategist Steve Bannon unleashed a torrent of insults against former President George W. Bush in California Friday night. \"President Bush embarrassed himself,\" Bannon said, in a 40-minute address at an annual California Republican Party convention in Anaheim, Calif. \"He has no earthly idea whether he is coming or going just like it was when he was president of the United States,\" Bannon said to a smattering of applause and laughter. Bannon also called Bush the \"most destructive\" president in American history for allowing China's rise as an economic force. \"It's clear he didn't understand anything he was talking about,\" Bannon continued, referring to a speech delivered by Bush just a day earlier, in which the 43rd president never alluded to President Trump by name. Bush did, however, denounce many of the policies and political tactics frequently employed by Trump and which have become synonymous with his administration \u2014 many of which political observers also associate with Bannon. \"We've seen nationalism distorted into nativism, forgotten the dynamism that immigration has always brought to America,\" Bush, who advocated for comprehensive immigration legislation late in his presidency, said at the Bush Institute's Spirit of Liberty event in New York City. \"We see a fading confidence in the value of free markets and international trade, forgetting that conflict, instability and poverty follow in the wake of protectionism,\" he added. Bush's two-term presidency embraced the tenets of free trade. Throughout his administration, he warned against global protectionism, which he believed would stunt the nation's economic growth. Returning to themes that Bush said are driving Americans apart, the former president said, \"Bigotry seems emboldened. Our politics seems more vulnerable to conspiracy theories and outright fabrication.\" (Bush wasn't the only former president this week seeming to respond to the particular style of politics that has been championed by both Trump and Bannon. \"If you have to win a campaign by dividing people,\" former President Barack Obama said at a Virginia political rally Thursday night, \"you're not going to be able to govern them. You won't be able to unite them later if that's how you start.\" Like Bush, Obama did not mention either Trump or Bannon by name.) Bannon's attack on the former president a day after Bush's speech is the latest salvo in the former Trump aide's self-described \"war\" on establishment Republicanism. \"Right now it's a season of war on the GOP establishment,\" Bannon declared last week at the annual Values Voter Summit in Washington, D.C. Since returning to his position as executive chairman of Breitbart, Bannon has launched a comprehensive effort to support anti-establishment GOP candidates who will be loyal to President Trump's agenda \u2014 even in hotly contested 2018 races for Senate seats the GOP needs to hold in order to maintain and grow its majority in Congress' upper chamber. Presaging his efforts for the midterm cycle, Bannon recently backed former Alabama Supreme Court Chief Judge Roy Moore in a GOP primary against Sen. Luther Strange, an incumbent who had been appointed by scandal-scarred governor and who was backed by both Trump and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky. Moore won the primary but is now in a tighter than expected general election race in traditionally deep-red Alabama. GOP Sens. Jeff Flake of Arizona, Dean Heller of Nevada, Thad Cochran of Mississippi, Deb Fischer of Nebraska and John Barrasso Wyoming are already in Bannon's sights for 2018. Sen. Bob Corker, R-Tenn., who Bannon had also threatened with a primary challenger, recently announced he will not seek re-election in 2018. Bannon said last week, though, that Corker, who has been an increasing critic of President Trump, is now a litmus test for other establishment Republicans. \"Condemn Sen. Corker,\" Bannon said. The Senate's top Republican is another litmus test for Bannon as he plots for 2018. \"All of you folks that are so concerned that you're going to get primaried and defeated \u2014 there's time for a mea culpa.... say 'I'm not going to vote for Majority Leader Mitch McConnell,' \" he also said in a speech last week. In California, where Democrats hold overwhelming political power in the state government and hold both of the state's U.S. Senate seats, Bannon urged conservatives to unite against Democrats in order to retain control of Republican House seats likely to be vulnerable in 2018 \u2014 and prevent Democrats from becoming the majority in the House with the new session of Congress in 2019. His call to action would have had a special resonance for the GOP party officials and activists gathered in Anaheim because there are five House Republicans in the Southern California area being targeted by Democrats in 2018. \"It's time for California to start having some victories,\" he said. And, he suggested Democrats \"are going to drag us so far to the left that we're going to hold those districts and Nancy Pelosi is not going to get her opportunity to impeach the president of the United States.\"",

            "article_content": "You might say George W. Bush wants to make America great again. In remarks Thursday, he criticized the kind of politics, sentiment and populism that led to President Trump's rise and election \u2014 though he never named Trump explicitly. \"Bigotry seems emboldened,\" Bush said in New York at a forum put on by the George W. Bush Institute. \"Our politics seems more vulnerable to conspiracy theories and outright fabrication.\" He slammed a discourse that seems \"degraded by casual cruelty,\" disagreement that \"escalates into dehumanization\" and a \"nationalism distorted into nativism.\" Bush, however, also criticized the kind of liberal populism that led to Bernie Sanders' rise on the left. \"There are some signs that the intensity of support for democracy itself has waned, especially among the young who never experienced the galvanizing moral clarity of the Cold War or never focused on the ruin of entire nations by Socialist central planning,\" Bush said. \"Some have called that democratic deconsolidation. Merely it seems to be a combination of weariness, frayed tempers and forgetfulness.\" After leaving office, the 43rd president mostly stayed out of politics. He was unpopular and was being replaced by someone whose election could have been seen as a rebuke to his presidency. Former President Barack Obama, his successor of a different party, had a very different worldview than did Bush, and Obama ran largely against Bush. But Bush, who didn't vote for Trump \u2014 instead opting to leave the presidential line blank \u2014 is stepping back into the spotlight and looking to take hold of the conversation around what America means at this moment. \"Americans have great advantage,\" Bush said. \"To renew our country, we only need to remember our values.\" Here's a transcript of Bush's remarks: \"We are gathered in the cause of liberty this is a unique moment. The great democracies face new and serious threats \u2013 yet seem to be losing confidence in their own calling and competence. Economic, political and national security challenges proliferate, and they are made worse by the tendency to turn inward. The health of the democratic spirit itself is at issue. And the renewal of that spirit is the urgent task at hand. \"Since World War II, America has encouraged and benefited from the global advance of free markets, from the strength of democratic alliances, and from the advance of free societies. At one level, this has been a raw calculation of interest. The 20th century featured some of the worst horrors of history because dictators committed them. Free nations are less likely to threaten and fight each other. And free trade helped make America into a global economic power. \"For more than 70 years, the presidents of both parties believed that American security and prosperity were directly tied to the success of freedom in the world. And they knew that the success depended, in large part, on U.S. leadership. This mission came naturally, because it expressed the DNA of American idealism. \"We know, deep down, that repression is not the wave of the future. We know that the desire for freedom is not confined to, or owned by, any culture; it is the inborn hope of our humanity. We know that free governments are the only way to ensure that the strong are just and the weak are valued. And we know that when we lose sight of our ideals, it is not democracy that has failed. It is the failure of those charged with preserving and protecting democracy. \"This is not to underestimate the historical obstacles to the development of democratic institutions and a democratic culture. Such problems nearly destroyed our country \u2013 and that should encourage a spirit of humility and a patience with others. Freedom is not merely a political menu option, or a foreign policy fad; it should be the defining commitment of our country, and the hope of the world. \"That appeal is proved not just by the content of people's hopes, but a noteworthy hypocrisy: No democracy pretends to be a tyranny. Most tyrannies pretend they are democracies. Democracy remains the definition of political legitimacy. That has not changed, and that will not change. \"Yet for years, challenges have been gathering to the principles we hold dear. And, we must take them seriously. Some of these problems are external and obvious. Here in New York City, you know the threat of terrorism all too well. It is being fought even now on distant frontiers and in the hidden world of intelligence and surveillance. There is the frightening, evolving threat of nuclear proliferation and outlaw regimes. And there is an aggressive challenge by Russia and China to the norms and rules of the global order \u2013 proposed revisions that always seem to involve less respect for the rights of free nations and less freedom for the individual. \"These matters would be difficult under any circumstances. They are further complicated by a trend in western countries away from global engagement and democratic confidence. Parts of Europe have developed an identity crisis. We have seen insolvency, economic stagnation, youth unemployment, anger about immigration, resurgent ethno-nationalism, and deep questions about the meaning and durability of the European Union. \"America is not immune from these trends. In recent decades, public confidence in our institutions has declined. Our governing class has often been paralyzed in the face of obvious and pressing needs. The American dream of upward mobility seems out of reach for some who feel left behind in a changing economy. Discontent deepened and sharpened partisan conflicts. Bigotry seems emboldened. Our politics seems more vulnerable to conspiracy theories and outright fabrication. \"There are some signs that the intensity of support for democracy itself has waned, especially among the young, who never experienced the galvanizing moral clarity of the Cold War, or never focused on the ruin of entire nations by socialist central planning. Some have called this \"democratic deconsolidation.\" Really, it seems to be a combination of weariness, frayed tempers, and forgetfulness. \"We have seen our discourse degraded by casual cruelty. At times, it can seem like the forces pulling us apart are stronger than the forces binding us together. Argument turns too easily into animosity. Disagreement escalates into dehumanization. Too often, we judge other groups by their worst examples while judging ourselves by our best intentions \u2013 forgetting the image of God we should see in each other. \"We've seen nationalism distorted into nativism \u2013 forgotten the dynamism that immigration has always brought to America. We see a fading confidence in the value of free markets and international trade \u2013 forgetting that conflict, instability, and poverty follow in the wake of protectionism. \"We have seen the return of isolationist sentiments \u2013 forgetting that American security is directly threatened by the chaos and despair of distant places, where threats such as terrorism, infectious disease, criminal gangs and drug trafficking tend to emerge. \"In all these ways, we need to recall and recover our own identity. Americans have a great advantage: To renew our country, we only need to remember our values. \"This is part of the reason we meet here today. How do we begin to encourage a new, 21st century American consensus on behalf of democratic freedom and free markets? That's the question I posed to scholars at the Bush Institute. That is what Pete Wehner and Tom Melia, who are with us today, have answered with \"The Spirit of Liberty: At Home, In The World,\" a Call to Action paper. \"The recommendations come in broad categories. Here they are: First, America must harden its own defenses. Our country must show resolve and resilience in the face of external attacks on our democracy. And that begins with confronting a new era of cyber threats. \"America is experiencing the sustained attempt by a hostile power to feed and exploit our country's divisions. According to our intelligence services, the Russian government has made a project of turning Americans against each other. This effort is broad, systematic and stealthy, it's conducted across a range of social media platforms. Ultimately, this assault won't succeed. But foreign aggressions \u2013 including cyber-attacks, disinformation and financial influence \u2013 should not be downplayed or tolerated. This is a clear case where the strength of our democracy begins at home. We must secure our electoral infrastructure and protect our electoral system from subversion. \"The second category of recommendations concerns the projection of American leadership \u2013 maintaining America's role in sustaining and defending an international order rooted in freedom and free markets. \"Our security and prosperity are only found in wise, sustained, global engagement: In the cultivation of new markets for American goods. In the confrontation of security challenges before they fully materialize and arrive on our shores. In the fostering of global health and development as alternatives to suffering and resentment. In the attraction of talent, energy and enterprise from all over the world. In serving as a shining hope for refugees and a voice for dissidents, human rights defenders, and the oppressed. \"We should not be blind to the economic and social dislocations caused by globalization. People are hurting. They are angry. And, they are frustrated. We must hear them and help them. But we can't wish globalization away, any more than we could wish away the agricultural revolution or the industrial revolution. One strength of free societies is their ability to adapt to economic and social disruptions. And that should be our goal: to prepare American workers for new opportunities, to care in practical, empowering ways for those who may feel left behind. The first step should be to enact policies that encourage robust economic growth by unlocking the potential of the private sector, and for unleashing the creativity and compassion of this country. \"A third focus of this document is strengthening democratic citizenship. And here we must put particular emphasis on the values and views of the young. \"Our identity as a nation \u2013 unlike many other nations \u2013 is not determined by geography or ethnicity, by soil or blood. Being an American involves the embrace of high ideals and civic responsibility. We become the heirs of Thomas Jefferson by accepting the ideal of human dignity found in the Declaration of Independence. We become the heirs of James Madison by understanding the genius and values of the U.S. Constitution. We become the heirs of Martin Luther King, Jr., by recognizing one another not by the color of their skin, but by the content of their character. \"This means that people of every race, religion, and ethnicity can be fully and equally American. It means that bigotry or white supremacy in any form is blasphemy against the American creed. (Applause.) \"And it means that the very identity of our nation depends on the passing of civic ideals to the next generation. \"We need a renewed emphasis on civic learning in schools. And our young people need positive role models. Bullying and prejudice in our public life sets a national tone, provides permission for cruelty and bigotry, and compromises the moral education of children. The only way to pass along civic values is to first live up to them. \"Finally, the Call to Action calls on the major institutions of our democracy, public and private, to consciously and urgently attend to the problem of declining trust.  For example, our democracy needs a media that is transparent, accurate and fair. Our democracy needs religious institutions that demonstrate integrity and champion civil discourse. Our democracy needs institutions of higher learning that are examples of truth and free expression. \"In short, it is time for American institutions to step up and provide cultural and moral leadership for this nation. \"Ten years ago, I attended a Conference on Democracy and Security in Prague. The goal was to put human rights and human freedom at the center of our relationships with repressive governments. The Prague Charter, signed by champions of liberty Vaclav Havel, Natan Sharansky, Jose Maria Aznar, called for the isolation and ostracism of regimes that suppress peaceful opponents by threats or violence. \"Little did we know that, a decade later, a crisis of confidence would be developing within the core democracies, making the message of freedom more inhibited and wavering. Little did we know that repressive governments would be undertaking a major effort to encourage division in western societies and to undermine the legitimacy of elections. \"Repressive rivals, along with skeptics here at home, misunderstand something important. It is the great advantage of free societies that we creatively adapt to challenges, without the direction of some central authority. Self-correction is the secret strength of freedom. We are a nation with a history of resilience and a genius for renewal. \"Right now, one of our worst national problems is a deficit of confidence. But the cause of freedom justifies all our faith and effort. It still inspires men and women in the darkest corners of the world, and it will inspire a rising generation. The American spirit does not say, 'We shall manage,' or 'We shall make the best of it.' It says, 'We shall overcome.' And that is exactly what we will do, with the help of God and one another. \"Thank you.",

The drama. The loyalty. The speculation about who stays and who goes. The Trump administration has it all. And so did Donald Trump's run on The Apprentice. The personality that made the show a hit is also what propelled Trump to the presidency. But as with his administration, Trump also stirred controversy on the set. A former producer tells the NPR podcast Embedded that at times, Trump used \"really unfathomably despicable words\" while the cameras were rolling \u2014 remarks that have never been made public. Of course, people weren't watching then for insight into how the show's star would eventually approach the presidency or what effect it would have on his public political image. But in retrospect, there are a handful of lessons that say something about the man now in the Oval Office. Hear from the people who worked with Trump on The Apprentice, including a former producer who claims Trump made racially charged comments during filming. Embedded featuring Taking Cover\n                \n                    \n                    NPR\n                    \n                \nhide caption 1. Questionable language In October 2016, just before the election, an Access Hollywood tape emerged of Trump using crude language about women, saying, \"[W]hen you're a star, they let you do it. You can do anything.\" When that story broke, former Apprentice producer Bill Pruitt tweeted that there were \"far worse\" tapes from Trump's time on that show. Pruitt says he does not have the tapes and has signed a nondisclosure agreement, but he tells NPR that the comments he was referring to were racist in nature and included remarks about African-Americans and Jews. Pruitt says that Trump's language was not a reflection of the culture of the crew and that at times, there would be an \"audible gasp\" from those who heard the comments. A White House spokesperson called Pruitt's story \"the same recycled and false attacks from over a year ago.\" There have been multiple accusations of Trump publicly using inappropriate or offensive language. He started his campaign by referring to immigrants as \"rapists.\" This summer, after a white nationalist rally ended in a death in Charlottesville, Va., Trump was widely criticized for not immediately denouncing white supremacists and instead spreading blame to people who were counterprotesting the neo-Nazis and KKK members. Those comments follow a history of ambiguity on white nationalism, as NPR's Danielle Kurtzleben has reported. 2. A businessman with baggage The first time Trump appears in the pilot episode of The Apprentice, he is seated in the back of a black limousine, introducing himself directly to the camera. \"My name's Donald Trump,\" he begins, \"and I'm the largest real estate developer in New York.\" He lists off his holdings: buildings, casinos, golf courses, model agencies and much more. Then he briefly hints at his past financial challenges. \"But it wasn't always so easy. About 13 years ago, I was seriously in trouble,\" he says, in reference to four bankruptcies involving his properties in Atlantic City and New York in 1991 and 1992. Credit:  NBC/Universal \"I was billions of dollars in debt,\" he continues. \"But I fought back and I won, big league. I used my brain. I used my negotiating skills. And I worked it all out. Now my company's bigger than it ever was \u2014 it's stronger than it ever was.\" In The Apprentice's entire debut season, these 20 seconds are the only substantive acknowledgement of the rocky financial history some of Trump's businesses had faced. From then on, the show consistently paints Trump as a triumphant underdog, with his troubles squarely behind him. \"Donald Trump is an icon,\" contestant Kwame Jackson told the producers in the season finale. \"He's someone who, when people said, 'You couldn't do it,' always got it done.\" That is a sentiment also echoed by Trump supporters during the campaign. Multiple episodes were set at Trump's Taj Mahal casino, which he described on the show as \"the No. 1 hotel in Atlantic City.\" Flattering shots of the exterior and interior portray the resort as thriving. In fact, the Taj Mahal, along with other Trump casinos, would file for bankruptcy in late 2004, just months after The Apprentice debuted. Still, Trump's business savvy was part of his pitch during the campaign, and many who voted for him looked forward to having an outsider perspective on the inside. Despite his bankruptcies, Trump largely maintained his image of success. 3. Ever the salesman Every episode of the show centered on a task \u2014 a business-related contest between two teams. Who can make the most money selling lemonade on Wall Street? Managing the Times Square Planet Hollywood for a day? Fixing up and renting out an old apartment? The winning team, besides steering clear of a scolding from Trump inside his dimly lit boardroom, would receive a reward. Donald Trump arrives at open auditions for second season of The Apprentice on March 18, 2004, in New York.\n                \n                    \n                    Frank Franklin II/AP\n                    \n                \nhide caption Donald Trump arrives at open auditions for second season of The Apprentice on March 18, 2004, in New York. Sometimes these rewards were simply a chance to visit classic New York landmarks: a private tour of Yankee Stadium or a boat trip around the Hudson River. But more often than not, the rewards also showcased and elevated Trump's wealth and business acumen. There was the walk-through of the extravagant penthouse in Trump Tower where Trump and then-girlfriend Melania, now wife and first lady, lived; the picnic at Trump's estate in Bedford, N.Y. (\"where the richest people live,\" Trump narrates); the driving range at Trump National Golf Club in Briarcliff Manor, N.Y. (\"the best golf course in New York state\"); the overnight stay at Trump's Taj Mahal casino (\"you're staying in the most beautiful suite you've ever seen\"); the jaunt to Trump's Mar-a-Lago resort (\"the No. 1 club anywhere as far as I'm concerned\") in Palm Beach, Fla. Credit:  NBC/Universal In Episode 9, one contestant's savvy business move earns him a reward of 10 minutes with Donald Trump. \"You know, a lot of people would like that opportunity,\" Trump tells a visibly appreciative Nick Warnock. Trump's financial ties have followed him to Washington, with watchdogs arguing for further separation from his businesses. Trump and his lawyers argue they have done enough by setting up a trust, rather than fully divesting as past presidents have done. Even amid criticism of being too close to his businesses while in office, Trump has spent many weekends at his Mar-a-Lago resort and his golf club in Bedminster, N.J. His hotel in Washington, D.C., has raised concern about whether world leaders would spend money there to curry favor with the president. And Trump hasn't shied away from talking about his properties. Even during controversial remarks about Charlottesville, Va., Trump took to the opportunity to mention his winery in the area. 4. Loyalty is paramount It didn't take the president's unearthed conversations with former FBI Director James Comey to remind the public of how highly Trump values loyalty. But the clues were also there in 2004, particularly during the firing of contestant Tammy Lee. In the seventh episode, as Trump dissects the losing team's failure as they sit before him, Lee breaks with the rest of her team to bluntly blame the team leader for having done a poor job of negotiating. Trump questions the rest of the team about Lee's dissension, asking, \"Was she honest or disloyal?\" The team and Trump agree Lee had not shown enough loyalty. \"Your disloyalty has been just terrible. ... I mean it is so obnoxious in this particular case,\" Trump tells Lee as the music swells, signaling he would soon deliver his signature sentence: \"Tammy ... you're fired.\" Credit:  NBC/Universal Comey has testified that the president asked for his \"loyalty\" and for him to end the FBI's investigation into former national security adviser Michael Flynn. Trump denies ever asking for a loyalty pledge, but it has been clear that Trump does expect loyalty from his team \u2014 even if he does not always reciprocate. 5. Trump can stoke a fight, even among others From the start, Trump was one of the executive producers of The Apprentice (even into his presidency). And, like any good reality television producer, he appeared to have a gift for identifying and, in some cases, amplifying squabbles between contestants. Take a tense scene in the boardroom in Episode 6. Trump is interrogating the losing team, leading to the typical chain of recriminations. Controversial contestant Omarosa Manigault (now an aide to the president) begins by complimenting her teammate, Heidi Bressler, before also adding that when she first met Bressler, she didn't think she had much class. Credit:  NBC/Universal \"Do you think Omarosa has class?\" Trump asks Bressler, looking for a response to her teammate's backhanded compliment. He adds, \"If somebody said that about me, I wouldn't like her. I don't care what they do.\" Trump then turns to another contestant, Jessie Conners: \"Do you like Omarosa, the way she just talks to you? I mean do you like her?\" Conners refuses to take the bait, instead trying to keep the peace by saying she does in fact like her teammate. But Trump isn't finished sussing out the conflict. \"How can you like her, the way she's talking to you? You know she's got a very sharp edge,\" he says about Manigault. And on it goes. The president has had his share of direct Twitter wars since taking office, but he also has a history of publicly stoking feuds between others. Wonderful @pastormarkburns was attacked viciously and unfairly on @MSNBC by crazy @morningmika on low ratings @Morning_Joe. Apologize! .@WhoopiGoldberg Don\u2019t let @Rosie speak badly of you or try to bring you down. She is rude, crude & not smart. She is not in your league. During the campaign, Trump created divides to his advantage. He tried to create a chasm between Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas on one side and Sen. Marco Rubio of Florida and now-Housing and Urban Development Secretary Ben Carson. In October 2016, he reminded supporters of Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., how Hillary Clinton had wronged them, saying, \"To the Bernie Sanders people, you got sold out.\" And last month, following a wave of kneeling protests by professional sports players, the president sought to remind the public of what he perceived to be a newly forming divide between the NFL's athletes and its fans. The booing at the NFL football game last night, when the entire Dallas team dropped to its knees, was loudest I have ever heard. Great anger 6. On ratings and popularity Trump has never struggled with being known, which made the first season of The Apprentice a huge success. Instead, his challenge has been to be seen as \"favorable.\" The show's first season in 2004 was a game-changer for a network in trouble. NBC, which was just about to lose its blockbuster hit Friends, saw over 20 million viewers settle in each week to watch Trump preside over the fates of 16 young entrepreneurs vying for a job with his company, The Trump Organization. Attracting 28 million viewers, the April 2004 season finale was the most popular show on television that week. According to opinion polls conducted by Gallup, when Trump flirted with a presidential run under the Reform Party ticket in 1999, the percentage of respondents who saw him as \"favorable\" declined precipitously: from 41 percent to 33 percent in less than a month. But in 2005, one year after The Apprentice debuted, Trump clocked in at 50 percent. Trump had never before \u2014 and he would never again so far \u2014 eclipse the 50 percent mark in Gallup's polls. As of Oct. 5, nearly nine months into his presidency, Trump is at 39 percent. However, what has been a historically low approval rating for a first-term president recently stabilized. Loading...",

In a sweeping speech at Paris' Sorbonne University Tuesday, Macron laid out his vision for an EU that would be less bureaucratic, more democratic and more sovereign \u2014 but above all, he said, one that would be innovative, risk-taking and audacious. Macron called Europe \"our history, identity, our horizon and what protects us and gives us our future.\" Looking back at the EU's founding, Macron recalled how the continent rose from the ashes of two world wars. \"But ideas triumphed and the desire for fraternity was stronger than vengeance and hate,\" he said. In recent years, though, Macron said Europeans had lost their objectives and become complacent and comfortable. \"For too long, the EU has been sheltered,\" he said, \"its security guaranteed by America. Its economic policy was to catch up with America.\" Macron said many of the things that had protected Europe are now gone. He introduced a sweeping series of proposals, calling for a common European defense force and budget, a European intelligence agency to fight terrorism, a European-wide asylum office and policies and stronger EU border force. Macron also called for levying taxes on American tech giants that make massive profits in Europe but skirt European taxes. Macron said Europe's greatest asset is its common market, which he said must remain fair and protective. He called for investment in cutting-edge research and more risk-taking. The pro-EU French president was elected in May, beating the National Front's Marine Le Pen, a far-right leader who campaigned on a platform to hold a referendum on EU membership. Macron said nationalism, protectionism and identity politics had lit the fires of conflict before and were now back, exploiting the fear and cynicism of people too long ignored. \"We have let doubt settle in,\" said Macron. \"We let the idea spread that the EU was an overblown bureaucracy. All of Europe blamed Brussels for anything that didn't work, forgetting that we are Brussels. We didn't propose or desire anything more.\" Macron said the only way for the countries of Europe to confront the challenges of today's world was in cooperation together. \"Global warming, the digital transformation, migration, terrorism \u2013 an inward-turning nation can do nothing if it faces these challenges alone,\" he said. \"Look at our epoch,\" he said near the end of his speech. \"You no longer have the choice of being complacent, like former generations. Because the nationalists who hate Europe will be here in five, 10 or 15 years.\" Macron said there was only one choice. \"We have to want this Europe and take the risks. It is our responsibility to our youth. Otherwise we are leaving them in the hands of the nationalists.\" Macron said he would not talk about Brexit because he believed that \"in a simpler, re-founded Europe, Britain could come back and find its place.\" The French president said EU founders France and Germany were still its motor today. Speaking of German Chancellor Angela Merkel, Macron said, \"We share the same European ambitions and I know her commitment to Europe.\" So Macron proposed to take French-German cooperation further. \"Why not set ourselves the objective that by 2024, we integrate our markets totally by applying the same rules to our companies, from corporate law to bankruptcy regulation?\" said Macron. Reaction to the speech across Europe was mostly positive. In Germany, where Merkel must form a new coalition to help steer Europe's biggest economy, politicians offered the young president encouragement \u2014 but also expressed caution. Foreign Minister Sigmar Gabriel, a Social Democrat, said the speech was a bold, passionate plea against nationalism and for Europe. \"We have to use this chance of a German-French initiative to together make Europe more democratic, involve its citizens and better prepare it for the future,\" he said. Macron, he said, \"can count on us.\" But Hans Michelbach, a member of Merkel's parliamentary caucus who regularly opposed aide to Greece and other Eurozone members, called the French president's proposals \u2014 especially those calling for a Eurozone finance minister and budget \u2014 \"unsuited to moving Europe forward.\" He warned they could lead to \"a deepening split in the EU.\" Analyst Thierry Arnaud at French news channel BFM TV says Macron's speech represented a gamble. \"His speech was shockingly ambitious,\" says Arnaud. \"He is clearly taking a huge political risk. He made numerous concrete propositions and he is counting on a Franco-German cooperation that is much closer than it is now.\" After Sunday's elections, in which Merkel's party lost Parliament seats, there is no telling what will happen, says Arnaud. \"We don't know how Merkel will respond in the short term because she has to negotiate the terms of her own coalition,\" says Arnaud. \"And some of her coalition members may not like all of the French president's ambitious new plans.\"",

In an interview with CBS's 60 Minutes on Sunday, Bannon said, \"Economic nationalism is what this country was built on.\"\n                \n                    \n                    Win McNamee/Getty Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption Steve Bannon, former White House chief strategist, is seen in the State Dining Room of the White House in February. In an interview with CBS's 60 Minutes on Sunday, Bannon said, \"Economic nationalism is what this country was built on.\" \"You couldn't be more dead wrong. America was built on her citizens. ... Look at the 19th century. What built America's called the American system, from Hamilton to Polk to Henry Clay to Lincoln to the Roosevelts. [It was] a system of protection of our manufacturing, financial system that lends to manufacturers, OK, and the control of our borders. Economic nationalism is what this country was built on. The American system.\" \u2013 Steve Bannon President Trump's former strategic adviser offered this riff about American history on CBS's 60 Minutes. He was responding to interviewer Charlie Rose, who said that \"people have been able to come here, find a place, contribute to the economy. That's what immigration has been in America.\" Bannon said he was \"dead wrong.\" So let's explore: Does the history Bannon cited support his case? Alexander Hamilton, first secretary of the treasury, from a portrait painted by John Trumbull in 1792.\n                \n                    \n                    AP\n                    \n                \nhide caption Alexander Hamilton, first secretary of the treasury, from a portrait painted by John Trumbull in 1792. First: Alexander Hamilton was an immigrant. He was born in the West Indies. In the 18th century he fought for his adopted country in war (as immigrants often have) and then, as treasury secretary, he contributed immensely to his adopted country's economy (as immigrants often have). He argued for the government to pay Revolutionary War debts, dreamed up a sophisticated financial system, and ended up on the $10 bill. Even in the 21st century, he continues to generate economic activity as the subject of a Broadway musical. Bannon is close enough in calling Hamilton a citizen, since he was present at the founding of the country \u2014 although all Founding Fathers were immigrants or the descendants of immigrants, who arrived in the territory of native nations. This illustrates the essential problem in claiming the country was built by citizens and not immigrants: Immigrants often contributed and also became citizens. It's meaningful that Bannon cites Abraham Lincoln, too, in his argument about immigrants. In 1862, Lincoln signed legislation supporting construction of a transcontinental railroad, which began a few years later. It was difficult to find laborers willing to work in harsh conditions, so railroad executives hired immigrants. Chinese workers were among those who laid tracks over the mountains from the west, until they met crews of Irish laborers coming from the east. Their meeting in Utah was an iconic American moment. Immigrants contributed more than brawn. During the Civil War, Confederate rebels launched the Virginia, a seemingly invulnerable ironclad warship. President Lincoln's government responded with its own ironclad, called the Monitor, so innovative that it became the ancestor of all modern warships. It was designed by a brilliant engineer named John Ericsson, a Swedish immigrant. As a politician, Lincoln was forced to address resistance to immigration. A powerful anti-immigrant movement rose up in the 1840s and '50s against Irish Catholics. The Know-Nothings, as they were called, won many elections, but Lincoln declined to join them. \"I am not a Know-Nothing,\" Lincoln wrote. \"That is certain. How can any one who abhors the oppression of negroes, be in favor of degrading classes of white people? Our progress in degeneracy appears to me to be pretty rapid.\" Bannon also asserts that 19th century Americans focused on \"the control of our borders.\" That is the opposite of the case. Americans were repeatedly moving beyond their borders. American settlers captured much of Tennessee from American Indians; they took parts of Florida from Spain; and in the most audacious move of all, sheared off Texas from Mexico. In each case some of the Americans involved could have been labeled \"illegal immigrants.\" One of the presidents Bannon referenced, James K. Polk, confirmed the annexation of Texas by going to war against Mexico. Some Mexicans perforce became Americans, because the borders had moved past them. Bannon also cites specific 19th century economic policies. He is correct that there really was an \"American System.\" Sen. Henry Clay of Kentucky made that his brand name for a basket of programs. Clay supported tariffs on imports to protect American industry. He supported internal improvements, such as roads and canals. And he supported the creation of a national bank (an idea borrowed from the immigrant Hamilton). Clay's system was immensely appealing to many Americans \u2014 Lincoln among them. It set the terms of national debate for decades. But tariffs that Clay supported also caused intense political conflict, and were denounced as special interest deals for manufacturers. When South Carolina first defied federal authority around 1830, decades before the Civil War, the dispute was not over slavery but a tariff. Then as now, there were arguments for and against any given tariff. The arguments against them are ones Bannon has employed in other contexts. A protective tariff empowers the government to interfere in the economy, and demands supreme wisdom by government officials to avoid unforeseen consequences. Tariffs may become tools of what Bannon has described as \"the administrative state,\" which he proposed to \"deconstruct\" when in the White House. The \"administrative state\" argument was also used against Clay's Bank of the United States \u2014 it was described as a corrupt and unconstitutional exercise of government power. Who made this case? Andrew Jackson, a president Bannon reveres and compares to Donald Trump. Jackson also famously vetoed Clay-supported road building. The fight between Jackson and Clay was part of an eternal American debate over the scope of government. In his use of history, Bannon has favored both sides of this argument. The 19th century was a time of tremendous growth and ferment in the United States, when Americans were wrestling with some of the same questions we face now: Who are we? What does our country stand for? And who counts as an American? Bannon is correct to find this history relevant, though perhaps not the way he intends. He's right that Americans built a powerful country in the 19th century. But that country was diverse, fed off immigration, was constantly changing, and was not really walled off from the world. Any suggestion otherwise is factually wrong. Steve Inskeep is co-host of NPR's Morning Edition and is writing a book on America's 19th century westward expansion.",

            "article_content": "Lana Lokteff, pictured, runs an alt-right media company to promote her white nationalist ideologies. But critics say that kind of outspokenness from a growing number of female allies is at odds with how men in the movement view women's roles.\n                \n                    \n                    Courtesy of Lana Lokteff\n                    \n                \nhide caption Lana Lokteff, pictured, runs an alt-right media company to promote her white nationalist ideologies. But critics say that kind of outspokenness from a growing number of female allies is at odds with how men in the movement view women's roles. Last weekend, when white nationalists descended on Charlottesville to protest, it was clear that almost exclusively white, young males comprised the so-called alt-right movement \u2014 there were women, but very few. So where were the white women who weren't out protesting in the streets? For the most part, journalist Seyward Darby discovered, they're online. \"It wasn't easy\" seeking out the women of the alt-right, Darby tells NPR's Lulu Garcia-Navarro. \"I spent a lot of time in the underbelly of the Internet \u2014 Twitter, YouTube, Reddit, 4chan, places like that \u2014 digging up contact information.\" In the Harper's Magazine September issue, journalist Seyward Darby digs into the aims of the alt-right's women allies.\n                \n                    \n                    Courtesy of Harpers\n                    \n                \nhide caption Darby dives into the motivations behind the alt-right female alliance in her cover story for the latest issue of Harper's Magazine, \"Rise of the Valkyries.\" She began her reporting around the time anti-Trump activists were organizing January's Women's March, when she wondered: What do the women who aren't in the resistance think about what's happening? Many of these women came into the alt-right initially as anti-feminists. \"They were people who felt that the feminist progressive agenda was not serving them \u2014 in some cases they felt like it was actively disregarding them because they wanted more traditional things: home, family, etc.,\" she says. \"And they came into the movement through that channel and then ultimately adopted more pro-white and white nationalist views.\" One of those women was Lana Lokteff, a Russian-American from Oregon who co-runs Red Ice, an alt-right media company, with her Swedish husband, Henrik Palmgren. The couple decided to make this their cause around 2012, Darby says, when they say they saw a lot of \"anti-white sentiment.\" Around the time of several high-profile police shootings of young, black men, Lokteff \"felt that Black Lives Matter and these other reactive forces were being unfair to white people and that then sort of spun into a conspiracy about how the establishment, so to speak, is out to oppress, minimize and silence white people.\" Lokteff, who promotes alt-right ideologies on the couple's YouTube channel, has been persistently trolled by the men of the movement. Darby wanted to understand what attracts women to a movement that is often hostile to them. In her piece, she quotes Andrew Anglin, who runs the (now blacklisted) neo-Nazi website the Daily Stormer as saying the white woman's womb \"belongs to the males of society.\" And alt-right pioneer Richard Spencer, who acknowledges that women make up a small percentage of the movement, believes women are not suited for some roles in government, reports Mother Jones: \"Women should never be allowed to make foreign policy,\" he tweeted during the first presidential debate. \"It's not that they're 'weak.' To the contrary, their vindictiveness knows no bounds.\" The thing they are most interested in is promoting the white race and they see [President Trump] as an opportunity \u2014 someone whose coattails they can ride. Seyward Darby, on whether alt-right members support Trump According to Lokteff and other alt-right women allies she spoke to, Darby says, \"It's not that men who support the alt-right don't like women, it's that they see women as fundamentally different than men,\" with equally important roles, which are \"to perpetuate white bloodlines, to nurture family units, to inculcate those families with pro-white beliefs.\" But the growing contradiction, as Darby points out, \"is that people like Lana Lockteff and other women that I spoke to are outspoken.\" She adds, \"They sort of see themselves as straddling a line between the male and female norms, because they think that at this point in their movement, the more people they can bring in, the more people they can convince that they are on the right side of history, the better, and that includes appealing to more women.\" To recruit women to the movement, Darby says, the key is to stoke fear. Asked how she would pitch the alt-right to conservative white women who voted for Trump, but are also wary of being labeled a white supremacist, Lokteff told her, \"we have a joke in the alt-right: How do you red-pill someone? (\"Red-pill\" is their word for converting someone to the cause.) And the punch line was: Have them live in a diverse neighborhood for a while,\" Darby says. \"She also said that when she is talking to women she reminds them that white women are under threat from black men, brown men, emigrants, and really uses this concept of a rape scourge to bring them in.\" And while there are schisms in the aims of alt-right activists, and how best to get there, she adds, \"There are some people \u2014 Lana Lokteff being one of them, Richard Spencer of the National Policy Institute \u2014 who are really trying to find some semblance of civic legitimacy.\" On how she understands the term \"alt-right\" The answer seems to be different depending on who you ask. ... It's not a formal, structured group. It is more a new term for people who believe in white nationalism, who do not like political correctness, who do not like feminists, who do not like Jewish people, and who generally think that liberalism and diversity have led to the decline of Western civilization. So, I would hesitate to call the alt-right a hate group for instance, but the alt-right does include hate groups. On being struck by parallels she saw, between the 1920s KKK and Nazi Germany versus today, in how white supremacists saw the role of women In the 1920s, which is one of the heydays of the KKK, a woman named Elizabeth Tyler became the head of the group's national propagation department, which is essentially sending people out to recruit more members. And she managed to boost the membership by something like 85,000 people. She also founded the first women's wing of the movement. She was considered a seminal figure in the KKK. She was ultimately pushed out, in part, because the men in the movement were threatened by her strength and her power. On what women bring to these movements On a very basic level \u2014 numbers. I think that the people who run these extremist groups, however loose or organized they are, recognized that there is strength in numbers. And to be a truly robust movement \u2014 women are a large portion of the population. ... Whether we're talking about white nationalism in the [19]20s, in Nazi Germany, today \u2014 so much of the ideology is about the importance of family, the importance of protecting the white race, which involves making sure women are there to have children. On how the language of feminism is being used to recruit women They do sort of occupy an almost feminist-seeming space in the movement \u2014 or some of them do, I should say. The ones who are more outspoken, the ones who are trying to bring more people into the movement. But of course, they would never say that. They would never want to be compared to feminists. ... They think that feminists have corrupted what women see as their core desires. On how women act as a camouflage, to appeal to others they might want to recruit on a more personal level There's a wonderful scholar named Kathleen Blee at the University of Pittsburgh and she has written a few books about women in right-wing extremism. One of the things she talks about is the role that women play in projecting this image of happy families, communities that are proud of their heritage \u2014 that it's not so different from your community. And it's a particularly insidious aspect of the propaganda. It's certainly something I encountered and was told repeatedly in my interviews. On what the alt-right women want [Lokteff] mentioned to me, people moving to Washington, D.C., getting involved in government. And, speaking to scholars of right-wing extremism, they said to me this is very unusual, usually these groups ... they're very anti-government. And so I think there is definitely a cohort that sees this moment, thanks to Trump's election, as an opportunity to assert themselves on that level. And I think there are others who want to fight a race war in a much more, I guess, literal way. This is one of the things that's going to be interesting moving forward with the alt-right, is seeing it's a motley crew of people who found each other on the internet and are really starting to, as we saw in Charlottesville, get out into the world and take action. ... And I think that we'll be seeing those fractures widen over the next couple of months and years. On how these women view the protest in Charlottesville and President Trump's reaction On the whole I think that they are pleased that they got this attention \u2014 that they are stoking peoples' frustrations, that they are showing themselves to be a force. The president's reaction, they're happy with I think. I asked [Lokteff] specifically, I said what do you think about Donald Trump? And she said, \"Let's be honest, he's not one of our guys. We've never thought that he's one of our guys.\" The thing they are most interested in is promoting the white race and they see him as an opportunity \u2014 someone whose coattails they can ride. The more that he does not disavow the things that they believe in, and either tacitly or directly supports them, the better.",

Updated at 7:40 pm ET Steve Bannon has lost his job as chief White House strategist. The White House described the departure as a mutual agreement between Bannon and chief of staff John Kelly. \"We are grateful for his service and wish him the best,\" said press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders. Bannon has been a larger-than-life character in Trumpworld: a right-wing provocateur whose rumpled wardrobe and radical politics belied his background at Goldman Sachs and Harvard Business School. (Bannon made a small fortune running his own investment banking firm. His compensation for one deal included a stake in residuals from the TV series Seinfeld.) Breitbart News, the website he ran before taking his job in the White House, also announced Friday that Bannon would be returning as executive chairman. Bannon took over as Trump's campaign chairman a year and a day ago, and he was credited with bringing much needed focus and discipline to what had been a seat-of-the-pants operation. Bloomberg Businessweek writer Joshua Green argues that without Bannon's skill at mobilizing disaffected white male voters, \"I don't think Donald Trump would have been elected president.\" The president, who doesn't like sharing the spotlight, often bristled at news stories that painted Bannon as the mastermind of his unlikely 2016 victory. \"Mr. Bannon came on very late, you know that,\" Trump told reporters at his New Jersey golf resort on Tuesday. \"I went through 17 senators, governors, and I won all the primaries. Mr. Bannon came on very much later than that.\" Trump offered only a halfhearted defense of his chief strategist, who has had a target on his back ever since joining the administration. \"I like him. He's a good man. He is not a racist, I can tell you that,\" Trump said. \"But we'll see what happens with Mr. Bannon.\" In an interview with the conservative magazine The Weekly Standard on Friday, Bannon said that he only ever planned on staying in the administration for a year anyway. Long before he had a formal role in the campaign or the administration, Bannon had been a cheerleader for Trump as head of Breitbart News. The website trumpeted that he would be returning just a few hours after his departure was announced by the White House, saying he had chaired the site's evening editorial meeting. \"The populist-nationalist movement got a lot stronger today,\" said Breitbart News Editor-in-Chief Alex Marlow, according to the article. \"Breitbart gained an executive chairman with his finger on the pulse of the Trump agenda.\" Bannon took control of the website in 2012 and turned it into a platform for the so-called alt-right. His nationalistic, anti-immigrant and anti-Muslim views proved a good match for Trump's. \"I'm an economic nationalist,\" Bannon told the Hollywood Reporter shortly after the November election. \"The globalists gutted the American working class and created a middle class in Asia. The issue now is about Americans looking to not get f***** over.\" Bannon told The Weekly Standard, however, that now that he is gone, those views could take a back seat. \"The Trump presidency that we fought for, and won, is over,\" Bannon said. \"We still have a huge movement, and we will make something of this Trump presidency. But that presidency is over. It'll be something else. And there'll be all kinds of fights, and there'll be good days and bad days, but that presidency is over.\" The take-no-prisoners style he is referencing, which was so successful during the campaign, proved a liability once Trump and Bannon reached the White House. The original shock-and-awe travel ban spearheaded by Bannon was quickly rejected by federal courts. His efforts to strong-arm lawmakers into passing a repeal of the Affordable Care Act backfired. And Bannon feuded openly with other White House staffers, including Jared Kushner, the president's son-in-law; national security adviser H.R. McMaster; and National Economic Council Director Gary Cohn. \"Bannon really believes this stuff to a degree that's almost scary,\" Green told Fresh Air's Terry Gross. \"I think that Trump is driven mainly by opportunism, by a desire to pursue whatever is going to get Donald Trump positive coverage on cable news now. And during the campaign, when nationalism \u2014 when Bannon's nationalism seemed to work for him, that was what he would espouse. But when that stopped working for him in February, after he became president, he was happy to bring in people [like McMaster and Cohn] who nationalists abhor.\" Bannon raised eyebrows earlier this week when he granted an unsolicited interview to The American Prospect, a liberal magazine. Although he was one of the few White House staffers who embraced the president's remarks on the deadly violence connected to a white nationalist rally in Charlottesville, Va., Bannon dismissed the white nationalists at the center of the violent protests as a \"fringe element,\" \"losers\" and a \"collection of clowns,\" in the interview, published Wednesday. It was a surprising comment from a man who successfully harnessed white nationalism, first at Breitbart and later in the Trump campaign. The Anti-Defamation League applauded Bannon's departure on Friday. In a statement, CEO Jonathan Greenblatt said, \"Hate has no place in our nation: not in our town squares and not in our White House.\" House Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi of California called the development \"welcome news\" but added, \"The Trump Administration must not only purge itself of the remaining white supremacists on staff, but abandon the bigoted ideology that clearly governs its decisions.\" Bannon argued in the American Prospect interview that it's self-defeating for Democrats to overplay \"identity politics.\" Steve Bannon's exit does not erase @realDonaldTrump\u2019s long record of lifting up racist viewpoints & advancing repulsive policies. #BannonOut \"If the left is focused on race and identity, and we go with economic nationalism, we can crush the Democrats,\" Bannon said. Bloomberg's Joshua Green predicted on Fresh Air in July that Bannon would \"keep fighting for this idea of an anti-immigrant nationalism, come hell or high water.\" Bannon told Green on Friday he would be \"going to war\" for the president, now pursuing his agenda from outside the White House. \"If there's any confusion out there, let me clear it up: I'm leaving the White House and going to war for Trump against his opponents \u2014 on Capitol Hill, in the media, and in corporate America,\" he said.",

President Trump's chief strategist, Steve Bannon, unloads on white nationalists, China and some of his administration colleagues in an interview with the liberal magazine The American Prospect. Bannon \u2014 who successfully harnessed the so-called alt-right, a term used to describe white nationalists, as executive chairman of Breitbart News and later as an architect of Trump's unlikely election victory \u2014 dismissed white nationalist ideology as a \"fringe element\" that appeals to \"losers\" and a \"collection of clowns.\" \"I think the media plays it up too much, and we gotta help crush it,\" Bannon said in the interview, which was published Wednesday. The White House strategist is happy, though, to see Democrats emphasize racism. \"If the left is focused on race and identity, and we go with economic nationalism, we can crush the Democrats,\" Bannon said. He echoed those comments in a separate interview with The New York Times. Some analysts on the left, such as Columbia University historian Mark Lilla, agree with this argument. Even those whose philosophy is diametrically opposed to Bannon's have expressed grudging respect for his skill as a political tactician. Bannon reached out, unsolicited, to American Prospect co-founder Robert Kuttner because they share similar concerns about U.S. trade policy toward China. \"I'm slightly embarrassed that there is this point of convergence,\" Kuttner told NPR's Morning Edition on Thursday. \"His strategy \u2014 which is grandiose and, I think, misguided \u2014 is that he's going to build a grand, left-right coalition of people who are critical of trade policy.\" In the American Prospect interview, Bannon described economic competition between the U.S. and China in apocalyptic terms. \"The economic war with China is everything. And we have to be maniacally focused on that,\" Bannon said. \"If we continue to lose it, we're five years away, I think, 10 years at the most, of hitting an inflection point from which we'll never be able to recover.\" The Trump administration has promised to crack down on what critics see as unfair trade practices by China. At the same time, the White House is pursuing cooperation from Beijing to put the brakes on North Korea's nuclear and missile programs. Earlier this week, the president directed his trade representative to consider launching an investigation into whether China unfairly pressures U.S. companies to share their intellectual property as a condition of entering the Chinese market. The move came after U.S. diplomats had secured China's support for a new round of sanctions against North Korea at the United Nations. Bannon dismissed the North Korean threat as a \"sideshow,\" insisting the economic contest with China can't wait. \"One of us is going to be a hegemon in 25 or 30 years, and it's gonna be them if we go down this path.\" Bannon conceded that others within the administration have a different view. \"They're wetting themselves,\" he said of rivals at the State Department and the Pentagon, adding, \"That's a fight I fight every day here.\" Bannon also acknowledged that despite the president's bellicose \"locked and loaded\" rhetoric, there is no viable military solution to North Korea's nuclear saber rattling. \"Forget it,\" he said bluntly. \"Until somebody solves the part of the equation that shows me that 10 million people in Seoul don't die in the first 20 minutes from conventional weapons, I don't know what you're talking about, there's no military solution here, they got us.\" White House spokeswoman Lindsay Walters declined to elaborate on Bannon's interview. \"Steve Bannon's comments stand on their own,\" Walters told reporters. \"You are going to have to contact Steve Bannon for more.\" On Tuesday, Trump was asked whether he still has confidence in his chief strategist and offered less than full-throated support. \"I like him. He's a good man. He is not a racist, I can tell you that,\" Trump said. \"But we'll see what happens with Mr. Bannon.\" Kuttner concludes his magazine piece by saying Bannon invited him to the White House to continue their conversation on China sometime after Labor Day. \"We'll see if he's still there,\" Kuttner wrote.",

A rally with white nationalists chanting phrases like \"Jews will not replace us\" and \"end immigration, one people, one nation\" was, as many expressed online, disturbing yet not really all that surprising. Within hours of the tragedy in Charlottesville, journalists, scholars and other leading voices weighed in around the Internet, with analysis and deeper understanding of how this unfolded. Below are some of the most revealing pieces we read. Here at Code Switch, my teammate Gene Demby wrote about about how white nationalists are edging their movement out of the shadows: \"Richard Spencer, the white nationalist leader and University of Virginia alum who coined the term 'alt-right,' would likely count that openness as its own incremental success. 'If you greeted someone in 1985 and you said, 'all gays should marry,' you actually would get a lot of laughs,' Spencer told The Atlantic last year, not long after the election. 'By 2015, gay marriage is popular. What is possible has shifted. That's what the alt-right is doing. It's shifting the reality of what's possible, and imagining a reality in which they are.' \" Code Switch alum Matt Thompson, now executive editor at The Atlantic, riffed on the brazenness of the white supremacists who marched this weekend, compared with Klan members of decades past who hid under white hoods. \"The shameless return of white supremacy into America's public spaces seems to be happening by degrees, and quickly,\" Thompson wrote. Dara Lind, a reporter at Vox who wrote an explainer of the rally and its origins, described it as a \"coming-out party for resurgent white nationalism in America.\" Nathan Guttman, a reporter with Forward, an online news site aimed at Jewish Americans, penned a vivid piece about covering the march. He recounted watching as Spencer launched into a rant about the mayor of Charlottesville, Michael Signer. \" '[L]ittle Mayor Signer \u2014 SEE-NER \u2014 how do you pronounce this little creep's name?' asked Richard Spencer, a right-wing leader who dreams of a 'white ethnostate,' as he stood on a bench under a tree to rally his troops, deprived of their protest. The crowd knew exactly how to pronounce his name: 'Jew, Jew, Jew, Jew' some shouted out. The rest burst out in laughter. And that was one of the only moments of levity the alt-right audience gathered under the tree enjoyed.\" And Jia Tolentino, a writer for The New Yorker and a graduate of the University of Virginia, meditated on Charlottesville's progressive guise and ability to hide its dark racial past. \"While I was at U.V.A., the fact that slaves had built the school was hardly discussed, and the most prominent acknowledgment that Jefferson was a slave owner came on Valentine's Day, when signs went up all over campus that said 'TJ \u2665s Sally.' \" Many writers also took on the response from President Trump, whose initial reaction to the violence in Charlottesville criticized equally both sides of the protest. \"We condemn in the strongest possible terms this egregious display of hatred, bigotry and violence on many sides,\" Trump said, in remarks that brought condemnation from both Democrats and Republicans. Writing for The New Yorker, Jelani Cobb parsed Trump's initial response further: \"We have seen a great number of false equivalencies in the past two years, and the most recent Presidential election was defined by them. Yet it remains striking to hear Trump imply that Nazis and the interracial group of demonstrators who gathered to oppose them were, in essence, equally wrong. It would have been na\u00efve to expect the President to unambiguously condemn neo-Confederates (\"Heritage, not hate,\" etc.), but Nazis? For reasons that are not hard to discern, the swastika, at least in the United States, has always been more clearly legible as a symbol of racial bigotry than the Confederate flag.\" Michael Gerson, a former speechwriter for President George W. Bush, lambasted Trump in a Washington Post piece, writing that the current president was \"incapable\" of speaking for the nation in the face of tragedy: \"If great words can heal and inspire, base words can corrupt. Trump has been delivering the poison of prejudice in small but increasing doses. In Charlottesville, the effect became fully evident. And the president had no intention of decisively repudiating his work. What do we do with a president who is incapable or unwilling to perform his basic duties? What do we do when he is incapable of outrage at outrageous things? What do we do with a president who provides barely veiled cover for the darkest instincts of the human heart? These questions lead to the dead end of political realism \u2014 a hopeless recognition of limited options. But the questions intensify.\" On Monday, Trump responded to the increasing pressure to react more forcefully, and gave a stronger rebuke. \"Racism is evil,\" Trump said. \"And those who cause violence in its name are criminals and thugs, including the K.K.K., neo-Nazis, white supremacists and other hate groups that are repugnant to everything we hold dear as Americans.\" In a piece for Commentary Magazine, John Podhoretz, a former speechwriter for Presidents Ronald Reagan and George H.W. Bush, cast a skeptical eye toward Trump's remarks on Monday: \"You can choose to have whatever opinion you have on the president's statement today condemning white supremacists, but it's hard to believe he would have read it out if he'd had his druthers. No, the real Donald Trump was the one we saw on Saturday when he decided to condemn violence 'on many sides' in response to the deliberately provocative and intentionally violent neo-Nazi march in Charlottesville, Virginia; when he decided to refer to the events as 'sad' in tweets; when he wished 'best regards' to those injured by the car that was deliberately smashed into them, killing 1 and injuring 20. When he acted in that way, he was operating according to his instinct. And his instinct said: Do not attack the white supremacists.\" What Trump's comments Monday mean for how, exactly, he will handle the resurgence of white supremacists, remains unclear. As Maggie Haberman of The New York Times tweeted shortly after Trump's remarks on Monday: If ever there was a time for POTUS to stand and take questions, this was it. Took questions on his NoKo statements, etc. Not this.",

            "article_content": "President Trump plans a European trip next week for a gathering of representatives of the world's largest economies \u2014 including those of allies such as Britain, Japan and Germany, and rivals such as China and Russia. The high-profile meetings will reinforce the general sense Americans share of any president: He is the head of state, the face of the nation, the principal architect of U.S. foreign policy and our advocate in the counsels of global power. Yet, in fact, the president makes and executes foreign policy not by himself but in a complex partnership with Congress. The role of Capitol Hill is easy to overlook, especially because Congress usually attracts far less attention in carrying out its part of the foreign policy process. That is especially true when Congress is focused intensely on a high-value domestic issue such as the health care bill now before the Senate. It is rare for an international issue to hold center stage for long on the Hill, and most members look to other policy areas to make their mark and please their folks back home. But on foreign policy, as with so many other things, the Trump Era is producing some unusual behavior. In just the month of June, Congress showed several signs of stepping out on the international front. Senate Foreign Relations Committee Chairman Bob Corker, R-Tenn., on June 26 staked out a position on a dispute between several of Persian Gulf allies that was quite distinct from President Trump's expressions on Twitter regarding the same dispute. Corker even spoke of holding up arms sales to the region that the Trump administration has trumpeted as a success story. Less than two weeks earlier, the Senate had passed a sanctions bill that included fresh punitive measures for Russia. These were on top of sanctions imposed by the Obama administration last winter in response to Russian meddling in the 2016 election campaign (and still earlier after Russia seized Crimea interfered in Eastern Ukraine). What made this bill especially noteworthy was the near-unanimous vote for passage, and the language limiting the White House's authority to lift the sanctions on its own. The House has yet to take up this legislation, and the president could veto it. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson has at least raised questions about it. But the near vote sent a \"veto-proof\" signal that could scarcely be missed. All this is surprising for two reasons. First, the Republican Party controls both the executive and legislative branches and might be expected to be more in sync with itself. Second, Congress has generally followed a pattern of deferring to the executive on foreign policy \u2014 a pattern in place for decades. Will the Trump administration see that inclination change? That question begs another: What is the role of the Congress in foreign policy supposed to be in the first place? Sixty years ago, the constitutional scholar Edward Corwin described the Constitution's language on the subject as \"an invitation to struggle for the privilege of directing American foreign policy.\" The Constitution gave some of the authority to the executive and some to the legislative branch, with the overlapping areas left open for negotiation. The founders knew well that this arrangement would require much coordination and give and take. And they knew that would be difficult. That's what Corwin meant about \"struggle.\" So the president was to be the military's commander-in-chief, but only the Congress had the power to declare war. Since World War II, the U.S. has fought in Korea, Vietnam, the Persian Gulf, Afghanistan and Iraq without war ever being declared. Presidents have found alternative ways to get our armed forces committed and also to get Congress to support them. The president picks his own people to head the State Department and the Defense Department and a variety of other agencies to conduct the U.S. foreign policy. But the Senate can block some of those appointments, including the most important. The Congress is also solely empowered to appropriate the actual funds for all these functions. And it has separate committees that authorize the various departments, setting out rules and guidelines for those departments that are enormously important to their internal business. Congress also votes on trade deals such as NAFTA and international treaties such as the Iran nuclear deal in 2015. So it would seem the Congress has many levers to work (or not work) that matter to the machinery. Yet as a practical matter, the modern Congress has usually chosen to cooperate or defer to the executive. Any vote on matters as thankless as overseas military commitments is seen as more likely to harm than help a congressional career. More typically, Congress lets the president take the lead, and lets him take the heat when things go wrong. Even when control was split between the parties, Congress has sought few outright confrontations on these issues. And presidents have found ways around Congress, as when the Iran deal survived a disapproval measure in the Senate, thanks to a special procedure that allowed Democrats to prevail by filibustering a measure to kill the deal. What seemed a textbook case for Congress to assert itself became instead a demonstration of how easily Congress can be thwarted. This is not a terribly new development. Presidents have been emerging as the dominant actor in our foreign affairs for more than a century. Strong personalities such as Teddy Roosevelt, Woodrow Wilson and Franklin Roosevelt dominated the first half of the 1900s. Since World War II, the realities of rival world powers wielding nuclear weapons have further empowered the president. More recently, the rise of the Internet and instant communications have further exaggerated the advantages of the person at the head of the military and the federal executive structure. There have been times of pushback. Congress passed the War Powers Act in 1973 in the wake of the Vietnam War and at a time when the presidency was weakened by scandal. Congress also staged extensive debates before approving the use of force against Iraq in 1991 and again in 2002. More than a few members came to regret the second of these votes quite a bit. Partly as a consequence, efforts by President Barack Obama to get an authorization to fight ISIS were largely ignored by congressional leaders. Obama relied instead on a separate authorization passed to fight a \"global war on terror\" after the attacks of Sept. 11, 2001. And once again, Congress let that go, preferring not to struggle. Now we are seeing the first divergence of powerful Republicans from the White House line on foreign affairs. There could be further examples ahead regarding Russia and China, North and South Korea, the Philippines, Iran, Iraq, Syria and NATO \u2014 just to name a few. The foreign policy thrust of the White House is itself a struggle between more traditional Republicans and advocates of \"America First\" nationalism. Depending on who gains the upper hand internally, the Trump administration policy could enjoy the usual degree of deference from this Republican Congress or it could experience the kind of turbulence not seen since the Vietnam War a generation ago.

William McKissic whose resolution to condemn white supremacy was passed at the Southern Baptist Convention annual meeting on Wednesday in Phoenix.\n                \n                    \n                    Ross D. Franklin/AP\n                    \n                \nhide caption The Rev. William McKissic whose resolution to condemn white supremacy was passed at the Southern Baptist Convention annual meeting on Wednesday in Phoenix. The Southern Baptist Convention voted to formally \"denounce and repudiate\" white nationalism and the alt-right movement at the church's annual meeting Wednesday, but only after the denomination's leadership was criticized for initially bypassing the proposal. The resolution decries \"every form of racism, including alt-right white supremacy and every form of racial and ethnic hatred as of the devil.\" There was a standing ovation in the crowded convention room in Phoenix after the resolution was passed. Southern Baptist leaders had declined to consider the resolution the day before, saying they were concerned that the proposed language was too strong. The decision was met with confusion and anger from members of the denomination and the public. And it highlighted divisions in the roughly 15 million member denomination that surfaced during last year's election. \"We regret and apologize for the pain and the confusion that we created for you and a watching world when we decided not to report out a resolution on alt-right racism,\" Barrett Duke, the resolutions committee chairman, told the gathered crowd of about 5,000. \"Please know it wasn't because we don't share your abhorrence of racism and especially the particularly vicious form of racism that has manifested itself in the alt-right movement. We do share your abhorrence.\" The original resolution was brought by Dwight McKissic, an African American pastor in Texas. He urged the Southern Baptist Convention to \"reject the retrograde ideologies, xenophobic biases, and racial bigotries of the so-called 'Alt-Right' that seek to subvert our government, destabilize society and infect our political system.\" The resolution did not originally get approved by a committee while several others, including condemnations of gambling and Planned Parenthood, did. McKissic told The Atlantic it was \"a mystery how you can so easily affirm standard beliefs about other things, but we get to white supremacy ... and all of a sudden, we've got a problem here.\" The move was criticized by Southern Baptist members and pastors on social media, including Trillia Newbell. Newbell is an author and the director of community outreach at the denomination's Ethics and Religious Liberty commission. She's also African American. \"Was I hurt? Absolutely. Was I discouraged? Yes,\" she says. But she says she's encouraged by the denomination's resounding approval of the amended resolution. \"I think it's important that we take every opportunity to denounce and set ourselves apart from anything that is racist or alienates our brothers and sisters in Christ who are people of color, especially given our history,\" she says. The Southern Baptist Convention has taken steps to distance itself from that history. The convention was created in 1845 after it split with northern Baptists over the issue of slavery. In 1995, the convention apologized for its role in sustaining and promoting slavery. Ten years later, in 2015, it passed a resolution supporting racial reconciliation. Newbell says she's heartened by those moves and the denomination's decision to condemn white supremacy. \"But have we arrived?\" she asks. \"No.\" Michael Radcliffe contributed to this report.",

Posters at the University of Texas at Arlington last month implored students to \"report any and all illegal aliens. America is a white nation.\" Also last month, at the University of Pennsylvania flyers blared \"Imagine a Muslim-free America.\" Hate watch groups have tracked 150 incidents of white supremacist propaganda on campuses since the fall. Even just a year ago, it was such a rarity no one was even counting.

The number of campus visits made by white nationalist leaders like Spencer looking to connect with students personally has increased. \"Our time has come,\" roared white supremacist Richard Spencer to students at Auburn University last month. It was one of a growing number of campus visits made by white nationalist leaders looking to connect with students personally. \"This is a new phenomenon that's very dangerous,\" said Oren Segal, head of the Anti-Defamation League's Center on Extremism. He says white supremacists, making a push for the mainstream, often try to lure students with more opaque slogans, like \"Serve your people,\" and \"Our destiny is ours.\" \"They don't necessarily shave their heads and wear swastika armbands where hatred is easily seen,\" said Segal. \"And what they're hoping is that people will maybe be interested because it's not so in-your-face.\" 'Publicity is great' One of those groups, Identity Evropa, describes itself on its website as a \"fraternity,\" though one limited to people of \"European non-Semitic descent.\" Applicants whose heritage is uncertain have been directed to undergo DNA testing. Founder Nathan Damigo says his current recruitment effort, #ProjectSiege, will get even more aggressive next semester. \"We're going to be setting up tables, and handing out thumb drives with videos,\" he said. \"We're going to have booklets and stickers and so on.\" Damigo, a 30-year-old student and Iraq war vet, became well-known in alt-right circles last month, when he punched a female protester in Berkeley. He says it was self-defense. He got into white nationalism by reading books by the likes of former Klan leader David Duke while serving a five-year prison sentence for armed robbery. Damigo says he needs to \"change hearts and minds\" of the next generation to realize his ultimate goal of a white-only space for whites in the U.S. \"Forced diversity and multiculturalism\" he said, is \"unnatural\" and whites need territory \"that is ours ... where we can be ourselves.\" Damigo dismisses those who call him a racist, saying it's a \"cheap strategy to undermine legitimate European interests.\" But he concedes the controversy has been good for him. \"I mean sure, publicity is great,\" he said. \"We found last year that all you had to do is put up some flyers and you'd get millions of dollars of coverage. So this is amazing.\" His flyers have been posted at campuses from the University of California, Berkeley to the University of Massachusetts Boston, a heavily minority campus. \"I looked at these images, and I was incensed because it was such an attack on our students,\" said Joseph Brown, a UMass political science professor. \"They were trying to be provocative; in Internet terms, they troll. They're trying to make themselves seem a lot bigger than they are.\" Tony McAleer knows the strategy all too well, having spent 15 years in a white supremacist skinhead group before having a change of heart in the late 1990s. \"Groups like this thrive on conflict,\" he said. \"I became an attention whore,\" said McAleer, who eventually left the movement and founded a group called Life After Hate to try to combat white supremacists groups. \"Every effort that was done to stymie what I was doing [gave me more] publicity and more recruits,\" he said. \"It becomes this dance. You have to be careful not to feed the beast, and not to give them exactly what they seek.\" Assessing the right response The increased presence of these groups has left schools and students trying to walk an almost impossibly fine line as they struggle to determine the right response to white supremacists. When white supremacist leaflets showed up at Purdue University, administrators said they didn't want to take the bait from \"a minuscule fringe group [seeking] attention it does not deserve.\" Instead, they issued a short general statement about the white supremacists' views being \"obviously inconsistent with the values and principles we believe in here at Purdue.\" But students were offended they didn't offer a more explicit condemnation and launched a sit-in. At a recent meeting of campus activists at UMass Boston, students were split on the right response. Student Katharine O'Donnell didn't even want to talk about white supremacists. Not only does it give them what they want, she says, but it also serves to normalize them. And ultimately, she says, it would only distract students from their efforts to fight institutional racism. \"Responding to a poster is in my opinion very damaging rather than these greater issues that are causing problems every day,\" she said. But other students pushed back, equally reluctant to let such hateful messages go unanswered. \"We have to let people know that this is not OK,\" said Gabriella Cartagena. \"We have to do something about this. We can't just pretend they don't exist and continue to push them under the rug.\" UMass Boston Chief Diversity Officer Georgianna Melendez says it's \"a hard hair to split,\" especially for a university that tries to balance its commitment to free speech and open academic debate with its responsibility to make all students feel welcome and safe. She says the white supremacist posters were ultimately removed from campus because they lacked required permission, but not because of their content. \"Everyone has a right to their own beliefs,\" she says. \"We didn't take a position on their message except to say that we understand it's harmful to some members of our community, and we can't just let that go.\" Like many schools, Melendez says UMass now has a kind of hate incident SWAT team ready to counter hateful messages and counsel hurt students. It includes an early alert system, a counter messaging response team and counselors on call. So far, hate watch groups say white supremacists' efforts on campuses don't seem to be paying off. They say there is no evidence that the groups are gaining traction or members, despite their claims to the contrary. But Mcaleer, the former white supremacist, cautions it's not an easy thing to measure since most activity is online, not on the streets. \"It's all virtual,\" McAleer said. \"It's like an iceberg. You see a bit of it at the top, and I don't think anybody has really measured how deep and how pervasive this group of disaffected kids is, and what exactly they're doing online.\"",

With barely an Internet whimper, Pepe the Frog, the anthropomorphic cartoon character turned symbol of hate, was put down by his creator, Matt Furie, over the weekend, in a single-page comic strip. The final images were of Pepe dead in a casket, with three former roommates paying tribute by pouring some liquor on Pepe's face and drinking the rest. The demise of Pepe \u2014 who had become a symbol of the alt-right, neo-Nazis and white nationalists \u2014 was as sad as it was unlikely. Pepe, from the start, was supposed to be a good guy. But in the story of his rise and fall, some universal truths about the nature of modern Internet can be found. But first, let's look back at just how Pepe came to be. When Furie created the character in 2005 and later featured him in the comic Boy's Club, he was just trying to make a chill bro who happened to be an animal. \"He's a 20-something post-college roommate,\" Furie told NPR. \"He's an anthropomorphic frog that lives with a party wolf, a bear-like creature, and then kind of a muppety, dog-like creature ... in a one-room apartment. And [they] kinda just party together and pull pranks on one another and hug each other and that kind of thing.\" Furie said the characters were loosely based on his life, \"living with a bunch of guys,\" and that \"Pepe the Frog's more of just the Everyman. He likes to take naps and smoke weed, play video games.\" Pepe really took off with one particular comic strip, depicting the frog pulling his pants down all the way to his ankles to urinate. After one of his roommates called him out, Pepe replied, \"Feels good man.\" A star was born. Denouncement as endorsement \"@codyave:  @drudgereport @BreitbartNews @Writeintrump \"You Can't Stump the Trump\" https://t.co/0xITB7XeJV http://t.co/iF6S05se2w\" And then, that same star was coopted, stolen by a 4chan fringe. In an effort described to the Daily Beast as a push to \"reclaim Pepe from normies,\" a dedicated group of 4chan users began to tie Pepe to white nationalism beginning around 2015. \"We basically mixed Pepe in with Nazi propaganda, etc. We built that association,\" one user told Daily Beast reporter Olivia Nuzzi. And during the 2016 election, that fringe ended up successfully tying Pepe to Donald Trump. \"Eventually, a popular meme of the smug frog with Donald Trump's hair started circulating online and then eventually got retweeted by the Donald Trump campaign,\" said Matthew Schimkowitz, an editor at Know Your Meme. \"When that happened, the meaning of Pepe as kind of a white nationalist or alt-right symbol kind of exploded. It was considered by many to be a tactic of dog-whistling from the Trump campaign to that sect of white nationalists online, and it became a new symbol for white nationalists maybe not online. It essentially amplified that specific meaning of Pepe.\" But what happened next was telling. Donald Trump's opponent, Hillary Clinton, publicly denounced Pepe, and that only strengthened Pepe's connection to white nationalists, proving that a lot of times online, denouncing something can function as an amplifier. \"I didn't notice anything until there was a Hillary [Clinton] explainer,\" Furie said. Schimkowitz added: \"Because such high-profile people \u2014 perhaps the two most famous people on the planet \u2014 were saying in so much that Pepe is a symbol of the alt-right, that became the kind of meaning for the meme entirely. It's what we call here the Pepe effect. When everyone starts using a meme to mean one specific thing, that essentially becomes the meaning of it.\" Furie fought hard to change it. He wrote an essay in Time magazine, to reclaim Pepe. There was a Save Pepe campaign, complete with links to a Save Pepe online shop on Furie's Tumblr. Furie even partnered with the Anti-Defamation League to get Pepe back from white nationalists. Clearly, none of this worked. \"These trolls, or whatever you wanna call them, they're kinda like the loudest voice on the Internet,\" Furie told NPR, a few days before he killed off Pepe. Strangely enough, Furie said he made the comic that killed Pepe off just a few weeks after the election, even though it just published online this past weekend. Furie said he had thought about killing Pepe long before the alt-right stole him. \"Honestly, I thought about killing off Pepe just simply when he became a meme, before it was even associated with hate speech,\" Furie told NPR. \"When an artist loses control of their creation, it's never that great.\" But he said he's not sad about the trajectory of Pepe's life. Kermit vs. Pepe The demise of Pepe the frog is particularly sad when compared to the fate of the Internet's other famous amphibian: Kermit. That Muppet character has blossomed over the last year as a tea-sipping, real-talk-providing voice of humor and reason, with a good heart. Perhaps part of why Kermit lived while Pepe died is that Kermit was defined in the culture long before the Internet. From the start, Jim Henson made him lovable. Not so with Pepe. This frog wasn't etched in the public consciousness before the alt-right got a hold of him. \"It basically says that things without very specific meaning can be changed pretty much in an instant,\" Schimkowitz said. \"If a word isn't clearly defined, it can then kind of morph. Memes kind of work the same way.\" Schimkowitz compares Kermit the Frog to Superman, in that both characters have definitions that existed long before the Internet, personas that will likely never change, and might face backlash if anyone tried. \"In the last couple of Superman movies, there's been a lot of outcry about how dark they made the character,\" he said. \"He wasn't necessarily saving anybody, which is pretty much the opposite of what everybody knows about Superman. \"Superman wasn't doing Superman,\" Schimkowitz said. \"Kermit has that, too. People are so familiar with these characters, that they're not just going to suddenly forget their entire lifetime with them and accept something new.\" And that's where Pepe failed, if his takeover by the alt-right could be considered his fault. The frog white nationalists wanted him to be was a stronger character than the one Furie did. And if that's the case, the worst version probably always wins. Even now, the alt-right seems to be having its way with another symbol: the \"OK\" hand gesture, though the jury's still out on whether it's becoming a hate sign, or just being used to troll mainstream news outlets. Either way, chances are, given enough time, it too will morph into something bad, not something better. The moral arc of the Internet is long, but it usually bends towards awful.",

Drivers ferrying these animals to slaughterhouses have been intercepted and accused of transporting cows, an animal many Hindus consider sacred. A new report from Human Rights Watch says that this devotion to protecting the cow has contributed to recent vigilante violence.\n                \n                    \n                    Julie McCarthy/NPR\n                    \n                \nhide caption A buffalo market in central Rajasthan, India. Drivers ferrying these animals to slaughterhouses have been intercepted and accused of transporting cows, an animal many Hindus consider sacred. A new report from Human Rights Watch says that this devotion to protecting the cow has contributed to recent vigilante violence. In India, Hindu nationalists have swept recent elections, and flush from victory, stand accused of using vigilantism to promote a Hindu way of life for all Indians. At a buffalo market outside the town of Nasirabad in central Rajasthan, transporters say Hindu vigilantes have targeted them on rumors that they have sold, bought, or killed cows for beef. Mohammad Salim is a driver at this market with its forlorn-looking animals corralled beneath a canopy, twitching in the scorching heat. Salim is a Muslim, like many of the men who work at this hardscrabble market. He was carrying buffalo to slaughter two weeks ago when he says he was stopped outside New Delhi, the Indian capital. \"A car intercepted me,\" Salim says. \"And a girl got out and said \u2013 'what's in your truck?'\" Soon some 15 men were on him \u2014 self-appointed cow protectors, according to Salim, who insisted he was transporting cows. They beat him and stole his money. The police who came to the scene extorted more, he says. He is paid less than $40 a run. \"I have been doing this for seven years, and I was never attacked before,\" says the bruised 32-year-old Salim. \"Now it is happening. And we're scared.\" Older drivers have quit. Salim Qureshi, the secretary of the market, says even farmers have stopped bringing their old buffalo to sell for fear of falling afoul of the cow protection outfits lying in wait. Business is down 75 percent, he says. Traders and transporters in Nasiarabad blame Yogi Adityanath, the newly elected chief administrator in the neighboring state of Uttar Pradesh. Like Prime Minister Narendra Modi, he's a self-avowed Hindu nationalist. The creation of a Hindu Rastra, or state, is a central tenet for this Hindu priest. In a new report, Human Rights Watch cited his devotion to protecting the cow as contributing to the recent vigilante violence. Earlier this month, a mob in Rajasthan lynched a 55-year-old driver, alleging he was illegally carrying cows. The state of Gujarat, meanwhile, made slaughtering a cow punishable by life in prison. Other states have strengthened cow welfare rules, which are multiplying. Most parts of India ban the slaughter of cows, an animal many Hindus, who are the majority, consider holy. For Sadhvi Kamal Didi, it's a \"giver of life.\" The president of the women's wing of the National Cow Protection Group, she says her members will take the law into their own hands when the police don't. \"We are not going to allow cow smuggling. And we won't allow them to be slaughtered. Whoever wants to stay here in India, they stay here as a Hindu. This is our country, we should dominate, and things should happen according to us.\" \"Anyone who doesn't like it,\" she says, \"can go to Pakistan.\" Sadhvi Kamal Didi, president of the women's wing of the National Cow Protection Group, says her members will take the law into their own hands when the police fail to arrive on the scene to enforce cow welfare laws.\n                \n                    \n                    Julie McCarthy/NPR\n                    \n                \nhide caption Sadhvi Kamal Didi, president of the women's wing of the National Cow Protection Group, says her members will take the law into their own hands when the police fail to arrive on the scene to enforce cow welfare laws. Yogi Adityanath founded a group to advance, critics say violently, a Hindu way of life. The Hindu Yuva Vahini\u2013 or Hindu Youth Brigade\u2014 recently enlisted police to disrupt a Good Friday church service alleging that Christians were converting Hindus. Police found the claim baseless. Nagendra Tomar is a leader of the Brigade and makes similar charges against Muslims. Speaking through an interpreter he told NPR, \"In Muslim-dominated areas of India Hindu girls are lured into having sexual relations\" with Muslim men, \"and then they convert them.\" Historian Romila Thapar says the lack of outright condemnation by either Narendra Modi or Yogi Adityanath of the growing zealotry may have emboldened it. Thapar says the two leaders who rely on the allegiance of Hindu nationalists may feel no need to discourage it. \"Now there is a much greater perception that the majority is in power and the majority therefore can do what it pleases.\" But author and historian D.N. Jha says Hindu nationalism cannot succeed in a country whose population is nearly 15 percent Muslim. \"Will we throw them out into the Bay of Bengal?\" he says of Muslim Indians. \"Why don't these jokers realize this?\" Thapur sees a larger significance in the current vigilantism that goes beyond acting outside the law. \"It's an alternate claim to being legal,\" she says. \"You defy the laws of the state and you do it on the base of having community support, which you have carefully built up. And that is what gives it, in their eyes, legitimacy.\" Cow protection advocate Sadhvi Kamal Didi is in no doubt about where India is heading. And in Narendra Modi she believes man and moment have met. \"For the first time we've got a very good ruler in Modi,\" she says, \"and between the prime minister and Yogi Adtiyanath, we will regain our greatness.\"",

This story is part of a series of conversations on Morning Edition with politicians, writers, scientists, theologians, tech innovators and others. From globalization to religious tolerance, identity to climate change, our conversations seek to capture this moment and how we're shaped by it \u2014 as individuals, nations and as a global civilization. In 1965, the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr., said that \"the arc of the moral universe is long, but it bends toward justice.\" To borrow King's imagery in 2017: Which way is the arc of our history bending? That's a big question we're posing at NPR. We can't easily report on the future, but we can ask smart people how they think we got to this point in history, and where they think we're going. It's a vital conversation at this transformative moment in our political and social order, here and around the world. Depending on where you stand, we're experiencing either a long-needed course correction or a feeling that the world has lost its way. Whatever your view, the rate of change has been dizzying. So what is really going on? We're asking a diverse group of thinkers to help chart what amounts to the history of our time. These conversations began with the social scientist Francis Fukuyama, who famously proclaimed \"the end of history\" just as the Cold War was coming to an end. What Fukuyama meant was that a single form of government \u2014 liberal democracy \u2014 was on its way to triumph over competing models like communism. A quarter century later, the forms of democracy remain in place around the world. But many are becoming less liberal. Russia has an elected president and parliament but has cracked down on dissent and the press. Turkey has also cracked down on the press, and in a recent democratic vote chose to concentrate power in the hands of one man. In another conversation, Ireland's former president, Mary Robinson, warned of a \"strange moment\" in history. Much of the world had committed itself to \"very strong\" multilateral institutions, but she says, \"we seem to be now going into identity nationalism in a narrow sense.\" Identity nationalism, concludes Pakistani writer Mohsin Hamid, is almost hopeless \u2014 and it boils down to fear of change. \"Technological change is intensifying. We're becoming terrified by social media, by information, and in this state of high anxiety, we're looking to attach that anxiety to something,\" he says. \"And cultural change, demographic change, is what we're attaching it to.\" Recently we heard from an adviser in the Trump administration. Michael Anton's official title is deputy assistant to the president for strategic communications at the National Security Council. He says he's been so consumed by the day-to-day, he's had little chance to focus on the long term \u2014 despite that he came to prominence as a man who was trying to think long term. In 2016, while working at an investment firm, Anton anonymously published essays that sought to make sense of the Trump phenomenon. The most famous was \"The Flight 93 Election.\" Anton compared Trump voters to passengers on the plane hijacked on Sept. 11, 2001, who were choosing to rush the cockpit. They might still die but it was their only hope. In his conversation with NPR, Anton was a bit more gentle in his description of the world situation. His new boss, he says, views Britain's exit from the European Union as both \"a hopeful sign\" and as \"a reassertion of nationalist sentiment.\" \"We want to put the brakes on globalization a little bit and reassert control over our country, our borders, our economic policy, our tax policy, with the recognition that the distinction of citizenship means something and citizens are in it together fundamentally in a way that the world community is not,\" Anton says. Anton spoke just as Trump was nearing his first 100 days in office \u2014 and as the president was discovering some of the limits on what he could achieve. Trump recently mused in an interview on Sirius XM that \"had Andrew Jackson been a little later, you wouldn't have had the Civil War.\" The president was returning to one the most studied eras of American history: the Antebellum Period, the decades leading up to the Civil War. The causes of the conflict can be traced back to the beginnings of the country. It is poignant and instructive to read the accounts of people who lived in the 80 years before the calamity. Many knew that something was going grievously wrong, that the political system was beginning to seize up, caught in its own contradictions. Some desperately warned against disaster. Yet no one truly foresaw what history had in store for them. In the early 21st century we, too, are headed toward some destination we cannot know, but we can at least get a handle on the direction we are moving. Will we know by the end of these conversations which way the arc of history is bending? Maybe not, but it's worth trying.

            "article_content": "The party of India's prime minister swept state assembly elections in the country's largest state. Over the weekend, a controversial Hindu priest was picked to the influential post of chief minister.  RACHEL MARTIN, HOST: For generations, India has tried to embrace religious freedom despite a history of religious violence. A recent election in the country's largest state is putting that tension front and center again. Here's NPR's Julie McCarthy. JULIE MCCARTHY, BYLINE: The new leader of the state of Uttar Pradesh has been called the mascot of militant Hindu sectarianism. And throughout his political career, Yogi Adityanath has worked to transform officially secular India into a Hindu rastra, or state. Shankarshan Thakur is a senior editor of The Telegraph, an Indian daily, and says few can match the 44-year-old Yogi's sectarian virulence. SHANKARSHAN THAKUR: He has consistently campaigned against the main minority, which is Muslims in India. He has called for their prosecution in unambiguous terms. He thinks India belongs to Hindus. He has won several elections speaking that language. MCCARTHY: While Adityanath is considered on the extreme end of Prime Minister Modi's BJP party, he's been elected to Parliament five times. MILAN VAISHNAV: This sort of strong form of nationalism is not incidental to Adityanath's appeal, it is absolutely intrinsic to it. MCCARTHY: That's Milan Vaishnav, who specializes in Indian politics at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace. He notes that Adityanath has introduced a national bill to ban the slaughter of cows, cows being sacred in the Hindu religion. He champions a name change for India to Hindustan. Vaishnav says Prime Minister Modi has handpicked the chief ministers in states where the BJP has won. Modi helped the party sweep Uttar Pradesh talking of the need for jobs and electricity. But by giving the nod to the saffron-robed Hindu priest, Vaishnav says Modi has signaled a twofold agenda and settled a lingering question. VAISHNAV: Is his project about development or is it about Hindu nationalism? And what this pick re-affirms is that it's not either/or, it's both. Modi has two faces. MCCARTHY: He says on the one hand, Modi wants to be seen as India's great economic modernizer. On the other, he's invested in a muscular form of Hindu nationalism. For his part, the Hindu cleric has promised that his state government would not discriminate and that he would follow Modi's mantra of development for all. Journalist Shankarshan Thakur says time will judge the Yogi's commitment to developing India's most populous state, but says the Hindu cleric's elevation to what he calls India's second most important office ignores a basic qualification. THAKUR: If you're going to ask me what are his administrative credentials at the moment, I would say he has none. MCCARTHY: But the chief minister's first directive would no doubt find broad public appeal in a country with widespread corruption. He ordered all top government officials to disclose their sources of income. Julie McCarthy, NPR News, New Delhi. (SOUNDBITE OF MOONCAKE'S \"CAST THE ROUTE\") Copyright \u00a9 2017 NPR.

Even though Spain has experienced an economic crash and an influx of immigrants, and there's widespread distrust of politicians, no far-right movement has sprung up. In recent years, Spain has had a devastating economic crash, an influx of migrants and corruption scandals that left people fed up with politicians. All these factors might make Spain fertile ground for the sort of right-wing, anti-immigrant political parties gaining ground in other parts of Europe. But unlike much of the continent, Spain has no such far-right movement. Why? The answer lies in places like San Crist\u00f3bal de los \u00c1ngeles, about a half-hour train ride south of Madrid's grand boulevards. It's a warren of drab concrete apartment blocks, with women wearing Muslim headscarves and Africans playing cards in the street. The Madrid suburb is about half-immigrant. Most residents are either retired, unemployed or in the country illegally. In a bar, white, native-born Spaniards bemoan their barrio's decline. The only local industry was construction, and that collapsed when the crisis hit in 2008. Immigrants have filled cheap, half-built homes. Cheap housing and immigrant-run businesses are found in San Crist\u00f3bal de los \u00c1ngeles, a 30-minute train ride from central Madrid. Although some longtime, native-born residents complain about changes in their area, they wouldn't think of turning to the right wing for answers.\n                \n                    \n                    Lauren Frayer/NPR\n                    \n                \nhide caption Cheap housing and immigrant-run businesses are found in San Crist\u00f3bal de los \u00c1ngeles, a 30-minute train ride from central Madrid. Although some longtime, native-born residents complain about changes in their area, they wouldn't think of turning to the right wing for answers. \"We used to feel like neighbors. But day by day, I feel like we're strangers,\" says Carmen Acero Rodriguez, 82, who's lived in San Crist\u00f3bal ever since she got married 57 years ago. \"So many new people have moved in. The barrio doesn't feel safe anymore.\" Acero Rodriguez says she was recently robbed by a Moroccan immigrant she'd hired to clean her house \u2014 though she quickly adds the culprit could just as easily have been Spanish. And it would never occur to her to look to the right wing for solutions or to feel safer. \"I'm a lifelong socialist!\" Acero Rodriguez says proudly. \"Why on earth would any working-class person vote for the right wing?\" In Spain, some of the feelings and frustrations that help feed support to right-wing and populist parties elsewhere in Europe are the same. But the political reaction here is very different. Picking up her kids from school in San Crist\u00f3bal, Maria Ascensi\u00f3n, 42, calls herself \"unemployed and angry.\" But she won't take that out on immigrants, she says. Many of Ascensi\u00f3n's own relatives emigrated from Spain to countries in northern Europe, fleeing the dictator Gen. Francisco Franco, who ruled from 1939 till his death in 1975. \"We had nearly 40 years of a repressive, right-wing dictator. That's why we don't have far-right parties like that of [Marine] Le Pen in France,\" Ascensi\u00f3n says. \"We have nothing so radical.\" Only on the left have radical new political parties flourished in Spain. In last year's national election, the new left-wing party Podemos, led by a 38-year-old former communist with a ponytail, won more than 21 percent of the vote. Spain is where many Arab and African migrants land when they journey by boat across the Mediterranean to Europe. More than 13,000 migrants arrived in Spain last year \u2014 the majority by sea. A banner reading \"Refugees welcome\" hangs on the facade of the Madrid City Hall.\n                \n                    \n                    Gerard Julien /AFP/Getty Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption A banner reading \"Refugees welcome\" hangs on the facade of the Madrid City Hall. Yet the sudden arrival of tens of thousands of foreigners in recent years has not provoked a rise in xenophobic or anti-Muslim feelings, says Carmen Gonz\u00e1lez-Enriquez, a social scientist who recently published a research paper for Madrid's Elcano think tank entitled \"The Spanish Exception.\" Spaniards tend to empathize with immigrants because most newcomers, until recently, have come from Latin America or Romania and integrated easily in terms of language, religion and race, Gonzalez-Enriquez says. And, Ascensi\u00f3n points out, many Spaniards have also been immigrants themselves. Madrid's City Hall is draped in a \"Refugees Welcome\" banner. And last month, Spain's second city, Barcelona, filled with tens of thousands of demonstrators \u2014 marching in favor of accepting even more refugees. Nobody complains about immigrants being on welfare in Spain, because Spanish government benefits are pretty scant. Unlike in the U.K., for example, there is no housing benefit, child benefit or long-term unemployment benefit in Spain. Instead, Spaniards value the benefits of EU membership, and they're among the most pro-EU on the continent. Old posters on the wall of a school in San Crist\u00f3bal call on students to participate in a strike last November. The slogan warns, \"Get out of the way, Francoists!\" Spain's experience of decades of dictatorship helps protect against an embrace of the right wing now. Calling someone a franquista \u2014 a follower of the late, right-wing dictator Francisco Franco \u2014 remains an insult.\n                \n                    \n                    Lauren Frayer/NPR\n                    \n                \nhide caption Old posters on the wall of a school in San Crist\u00f3bal call on students to participate in a strike last November.

Calling someone a franquista \u2014 a follower of the late, right-wing dictator Francisco Franco \u2014 remains an insult. \"The Franco dictatorship left Spain isolated and underdeveloped,\" Gonz\u00e1lez-Enriquez says. \"Spaniards felt inferior to the rest of Europe and wanted to join the club \u2014 for economic reasons, but also to recover national pride.\" While fear of Islamist terror attacks has become fodder for far-right political parties elsewhere in Europe, seeking to turn people against Muslim immigrants, Spain had a different experience, Gonz\u00e1lez-Enriquez says. The country's Basque separatist group, ETA, killed more than 800 people in Spain from the late 1960s until it declared a cease-fire in 2011. But in all those years, Spaniards never feared or racially profiled all Basques for the actions of a few radicals. Similarly, they're less inclined to turn against Muslim immigrants now, Gonz\u00e1lez-Enriquez believes. In Spain, regional identity \u2014 featuring distinct regional languages, holidays and culture \u2014 tends to be stronger than nationalist sentiment. Case in point: When NPR approached 82-year-old Acero Rodriguez in San Crist\u00f3bal, she introduced herself as a \"Castilian\" \u2014 from central Spain \u2014 rather than as Spanish. That kind of regional self-identification helps protect against far-right groups stirring up nationalism across the country, Gonz\u00e1lez-Enriquez says. There is one tiny far-right party in Spain. It was founded about three years ago and is called Vox. It's a Catholic faction that favors a ban on abortion, harsher penalties for ETA terrorists and more centralized power, with less autonomy for the Spanish regions. In the San Crist\u00f3bal bar, NPR asked Acero Rodriguez about it. After all, the elderly are this party's target demographic. But she said she'd never heard of it \u2014 and neither had her husband or a handful of neighbors in the bar. That may be because in last year's election, Spain's only far-right party got 0.2 percent of the vote.",

Polling places saw strong turnout for today's election in the Netherlands, with 55 percent of voters casting a ballot before 6 p.m. local time, according to local media. The crowd was manageable at a house in Marle, in the eastern Netherlands, that's hosted a voting booth for decades. While Holland's national vote is being seen as a barometer of populism, it's also reminding us of the wide range of polling places in Holland, from a gleaming high-rise to an old windmill. It's not a challenge for the Westhoff family to reach a voting booth; there's one in their living room at the bed and breakfast they run in Marle. In an arrangement that goes back to 1948, the Westhoffs' farm house has hosted voters in their small community of fewer than 100 people. The town is nestled between a river and a dike \u2014 a geography that can make it hard to visit nearby polling stations.

They've also removed a carpet runner that protected their wood floors. While the Netherlands' high voter turnout was expected, due to the divisive and passionate debates over nationalism and inclusion that have gripped parts of Europe, we have to think that other nations could boost voter participation if they put more ballot booths in quaint houses. It also wouldn't hurt to follow the Westhoffs' example, and lay out some fresh-baked bread on the coffee table.

Updated at 4:05 p.m. EDT The Trump era has opened with the promise of a White House foothold for media mogul Rupert Murdoch. It looks to be the kind of warm and solicitous reception in the corridors of presidential power that he has long enjoyed abroad. Murdoch has told close associates that the nation's 45th president calls to confer frequently \u2014 as often as multiple times a week \u2014 and that he has visited the White House to meet with Trump more than once. \"They have been friends for a long time,\" White House press secretary Sean Spicer wrote in an email to NPR. \"They speak on occasion as the president does with all his friends.\" Murdoch sits atop a twin media empire, made up of 21st Century Fox and News Corp, which together include such properties in the United States as The Wall Street Journal, Fox News, New York Post and more than two dozen local television stations. His interests span journalism, commerce and politics. But Murdoch has repeatedly proved a more pragmatic conservative entrepreneur than pure ideologue. The White House did not respond to requests to elaborate on the nature or content of Murdoch's conversations with the president. The Trump administration has not yet released any lists of visitors to the White House, though press aides have said they're working to set that up. Murdoch's aides declined to comment altogether, saying his travel and conversations must remain private. A relationship with benefits The rapport forged by Murdoch and Trump may prove handy for both men. Murdoch's news outlets often shine a favorable light on the new president; meanwhile, his media properties have many interests pending before the federal government. Several examples: The Justice Department last week fired U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara, the top federal prosecutor in Manhattan, after he refused to resign. Political appointees customarily resign at the beginning of a new administration. Bharara's former office is overseeing the Fox News investigation, among many other high-profile cases. The New York Times is reporting that the investigation is moving into the grand jury phase. Earlier, Bharara had declined to return a phone call placed to his office by President Trump. Without knowing the purpose of the call, Bharara concluded it would be improper to speak with the president. Ties beyond politics Trump and Murdoch \u2014 two billionaires with Manhattan-based enterprises \u2014 would seem to share common interests. Yet their political views do not always align. Murdoch has publicly adopted a different stance than Trump on some issues, among them immigration. During the transition, Murdoch urged Trump not to embark on mass deportations of people in the country without legal status. Rupert Murdoch and Ivanka Trump leave Trump Tower in New York City in mid-November last year.\n                \n                    \n                    Dominick Reuter/AFP/Getty Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption Rupert Murdoch and Ivanka Trump leave Trump Tower in New York City in mid-November last year. And Murdoch did not initially support Trump in the 2016 presidential election. Some accounts had Murdoch leaning toward Republicans Jeb Bush and Marco Rubio. He spoke favorably, briefly, of Ben Carson, now the U.S. secretary of Housing and Urban Development. Via tweet, Murdoch urged former New York City Mayor Mike Bloomberg, himself a billionaire media magnate, to run as an independent. Yet Murdoch has embraced the new president. And their links extend beyond business and politics. Murdoch once mentored Trump's son-in-law and adviser Jared Kushner as the younger man expanded his real estate holdings into New York City. And Ivanka Trump, Jared's wife and the president's daughter, until recently helped oversee a trust fund for Murdoch's young daughters by his ex-wife, Wendi Deng. Murdoch's journalism and the president The alliance is most visibly reflected in the sympathetic coverage Trump generally receives on the front pages of the New York Post, on Fox News' most popular shows and on the Fox Business Network. Former Fox Business staffer Andrew Kirell recently argued that Fox Business has outflanked even Fox News in its pro-Trump tilt. The Wall Street Journal has broken news that cast Trump officials and advisers in a bad light. Even so, many reporters have been critical of the paper under its top editor, Gerard Baker, saying that it went easy on Trump during the campaign to mirror the Republican sympathies of Baker and Murdoch. Baker told reporters and editors at a town hall session held last month that they should find work in other newsrooms they admired more if they did not like the way the Journal's coverage was shaped. A week later, Devlin Barrett, a widely respected Washington-based reporter who covered national security, left the Journal to join The Washington Post. When asked why he was leaving in a meeting with Journal Washington bureau chief Paul Beckett, Barrett cited Baker's pointed remarks, according to two reporters with direct knowledge of the incident. Murdoch has overseen Fox News since Ailes' ouster last summer. Though Murdoch's sons were laying the groundwork for a more centrist tone for the channel, Hillary Clinton's election loss scuttled those plans. Instead, the tenor of coverage has shifted even further to the right, echoing Trump's nationalism and hostility to mainstream media. Murdoch personally selected the largely pro-Trump host Tucker Carlson to replace the departing Megyn Kelly \u2014 who was vilified by Trump during the campaign \u2014 for her pivotal 9 p.m. nightly spot. Carlson is scheduled to interview Trump on Wednesday. (The New York Times Magazine is set to interview the president as well.) At ease in the halls of power President John Kennedy meets with Rupert Murdoch in 1961.\n                \n                    \n                    Bettmann/Getty Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption President John Kennedy meets with Rupert Murdoch in 1961. The Oval Office is not foreign terrain for Murdoch, a naturalized U.S. citizen. For more than a half-century, Murdoch has met presidents, including White House meetings with John Kennedy and Ronald Reagan. Kennedy submitted to interviews with Murdoch and one of his editors for two Murdoch newspapers in his native Australia. Incautious remarks by Kennedy led to intense White House pressure to kill the interview, which Murdoch did, according to an extensive account in the Australian Financial Review by one of Murdoch's Australian biographers, Neil Chenoweth. Murdoch's relationships have typically been far closer, however, with prime ministers in Australia and the United Kingdom, where Murdoch expanded his business. Each country's leader concluded the support of Murdoch's newspapers could prove crucial to their prospects. It has become a somewhat humiliating rite of passage for Australian political leaders to stop by Murdoch's offices on Sixth Avenue in New York City in private visits that almost invariably become public. Some Murdoch aides call that process \"kissing the ring.\" In 1995, two years before he became prime minister, British Labour Party leader Tony Blair flew to a small island off the Australian coast to meet the News Corp corporate board and curry favor with Murdoch. Ahead of his own successful bid, British Conservative leader David Cameron similarly flew (on a plane owned by Murdoch's then son-in-law) to a Greek island for a brief stop on Murdoch's yacht. Britain's new prime minister Theresa May appears to also have made a practice of such cultivation, even as the Murdoch family presses ahead with ambitions to take over the 61 percent of the British satellite TV company Sky that 21st Century Fox does not already own, an acquisition subject to government approval. And back on this side of the Atlantic, Murdoch may have landed a closer friend in the White House than he has ever enjoyed.

            "article_content": "Nationalism is intensifying emotions in a dispute in Europe over how Turkish officials can campaign among millions of Turks living in the Netherlands and Germany for a referendum back home.  AUDIE CORNISH, HOST: We're going to talk more now about that attempt by the Turkish government to hold a campaign rally in the Netherlands for an election happening back in Turkey. As we heard, the Dutch government blocked the rally, and the German government has done the same thing there, leading to some harsh criticism from the Turkish president. NPR's Peter Kenyon joins us now to talk more. And, Peter, just how big a controversy is this at this point? What brought it on? PETER KENYON, BYLINE: Well, there's this big referendum vote coming up next month. And it would dramatically change the system of government here. And the ruling party wants a yes vote to give more power to President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, and they're scrounging for all the support they can get, including from some of the 5.5 million Turks living abroad. Most of them are in Western Europe. There is 1.4 million in Germany, people who could vote if they care to on April 16. And that's actually where this started, in Germany. Turks went there, but they were blocked from holding a campaign event. The local authorities said, nope, security problems, you can't do it. And then President Erdogan compared them to the Nazis for this ban, which of course angered some Germans, as you can imagine. And then the same thing happened in the Netherlands, and this is where it really flared up. More Nazi comparisons were thrown around, and tensions really soared. CORNISH: Remind us again what exactly they will be voting on in Turkey. KENYON: Well, in some ways, this would make Turkey's government appear similar to the U.S. system. The president would become the chief executive in - like in the U.S. The prime minister would be eliminated. But analysts say the comparison with America's democracy is misleading because Turkey just doesn't have the kind of institutional checks and balances the U.S. does. Critics say the institutions Turkey does have are growing weaker every year as President Erdogan accumulates more power. Now, the other side, of course, is the security factor. There have been a failed coup, multiple terror attacks. Many Turks simply want a strong leader, and that means President Erdogan. Now, there's one other thing I want to throw in here. It's actually illegal under Turkey's general election law to campaign abroad. But that provision doesn't happen to have any penalties if you violate it. And this isn't the first time Turkish politicians have gone abroad looking for votes. It is, however, the first time they got such a big backlash for doing so. CORNISH: Peter, in the meantime, what's been the reaction from voters, from people in Turkey, to these European bans on campaign events? KENYON: A lot of anger, and it is dominating the news here - pictures in every venue and video of Dutch riot police using clubs and dogs to disperse Turkish ex-pats who were demonstrating at that Rotterdam rally. There are a few voices calling for calm, but tensions are very high. The Dutch ambassador has been told basically don't come back till further notice. Turkey's president says the Netherlands will have to pay the price for its actions. CORNISH: In the meantime, how are these disputes - I mean, as we mentioned, first with Germany and now with the Netherlands - actually changing the dynamic of the campaign back in Turkey? KENYON: Yeah, I think they are actually, Audie. I mean, early on, there were signs the government wasn't really happy with the yes campaign and how it was going. Some of their allies seemed to be splitting off on the fringes. But now even opposition parties are rallying behind Erdogan's very tough line against the Netherlands and Germany. One ruling party lawmaker says the yes vote is already up two points, and he predicts a much higher turnout among Turks abroad. Now, we have to say the polls here aren't really reliable, but analysts do agree that if anybody benefits from this nationalist anger at Europe, it's probably going to be the yes campaign, and that, of course, is the effort to make President Erdogan even stronger. CORNISH: That's NPR's Peter Kenyon in Istanbul. Thanks so much, Peter. KENYON: Thanks, Audie. (SOUNDBITE OF GREYBOY ALLSTARS SONG, \"PROFUNDO GROSSO\") Copyright \u00a9 2017 NPR.

Where the heck is your mercy?\"\n                \n                    \n                    Sylvia Poggioli /NPR\n                    \n                \nhide caption Anti-Pope Francis posters appeared in Rome last week, with a message in a Roman street dialect saying, \"Hey, Frank, you took over Congregations, suspended priests, decapitated the Order of Malta and the Franciscans of The Immaculate, ignored Cardinals... Where the heck is your mercy?\" White House chief strategist Steve Bannon is known to have cultivated ties with far-right parties in Europe, like the National Front in France. He also seems to have forged an alliance with Vatican hard-liners who oppose Pope Francis' less rigid approach to church doctrine. The New York Times reported this week on Bannon's connections at the Vatican. Before becoming White House chief strategist, Bannon \u2014 who is Catholic \u2014 was the executive chairman of Breitbart News, which he called a \"platform for the alt-right.\" That's a movement associated with white nationalism. During a visit to Rome a few years ago, Bannon struck up a friendship with the American Cardinal Raymond Burke, a traditionalist who has emerged as one of Pope Francis' most vocal critics. Bannon hired Thomas Williams, an American former priest, as Breitbart's Rome correspondent. Williams belonged to the conservative Legion of Christ, which was roiled by scandal when it was revealed its founder had been a pedophile. Williams recently told his own story on an Italian TV talk show: In 2003, he fathered a child, but he kept it secret until he was outed by a news report. He then left the priesthood and married the child's mother \u2014 who is the daughter of the former U.S. ambassador to the Vatican, Mary Ann Glendon. In July 2014, Bannon addressed a conference that was held inside the Vatican but was sponsored by a conservative Catholic group. Speaking via Skype, Bannon painted an almost apocalyptic vision of the state of the Western world. \"We're at the very beginning stages of a very brutal and bloody conflict, of which, if the people in this room, the people in the church, do not bind together and really form what I feel is an aspect of the church militant, to really be able to not just stand with our beliefs, but to fight for our beliefs against this new barbarity that's starting.\" A barbarity, Bannon added, that would completely eradicate \"everything we've been bequeathed over the last 2,000, 2,500 years,\" and which he clearly spelled out a few minutes later: \"We are in an outright war against jihadist Islamic fascism. And this war is, I think, metastasizing far quicker than governments can handle it.\" This is language that Pope Francis has never used. The pope has repeatedly urged European countries to welcome migrants \u2014 who are, in the majority, Muslim \u2014 and he has championed the rights of the poor. A year ago, Francis criticized candidate Donald Trump for wanting to build a wall along the border with Mexico, saying, \"A person who thinks only about building walls ... and not building bridges is not Christian.\" But that's not Bannon's worldview. While most Breitbart reports on the pope have been neutral, headlines about the pope when Bannon was in charge included: While Breitbart and Bannon seem to be making common cause with Roman Catholics who are on the outs with this pope, these Vatican hard-liners are not very powerful. Nevertheless, Pope Francis' supporters inside the Vatican worry that following Trump's election victory, the pope is a little more isolated \u2014 a lonely progressive on the global stage. They say this has emboldened his critics both within and outside the Vatican, who have become more vocal. For example, just last week, mysterious anti-Francis posters cropped up around Rome. The photo showed the pope looking uncharacteristically very grouchy, and the unidentified author \u2014 using a Roman street dialect \u2014 accused him of acting in an authoritarian manner and showing lack of mercy, despite the fact that Francis has made \"Mercy\" the unofficial slogan of his papacy. Francis has not reacted. But in a surprising move, on Sunday, he issued the very first papal blessing for the Super Bowl. It was a video message in his native Spanish \u2014 not in Italian, which he usually uses for official messages \u2014 in which he said such a sporting event \"shows that it's possible to build a culture of encounter and a world of peace.\" The Italian media labeled the message \"anti-Trump.\"",

            "article_content": "1 of 11 Updated at 6:10 p.m. ET As the Women's March on Washington has swelled in support, attracting attention and supporters in the lead-up to Saturday's demonstrations, its name has become something of a misnomer. Sister marches have been organized in all 50 states, several U.S. territories and countries around the world. They have tried to express solidarity with the aims of the original march: opposition to President Trump's agenda, and support of women's rights and human rights in general. Given the quirks of time zones, many of those marches kicked off before the event that inspired them. In Sydney, London, New Delhi, and other cities, demonstrators broke out their signs and pink hats before even their compatriots in D.C. could. Straight from NPR and member station reporters on the ground: Here's a glimpse of the marches Saturday \u2014 across the country, and around the world. Tens of thousands participated in the Boston Women's March, including Sen. Elizabeth Warren and Mayor Marty Walsh (bottom right).\n                \n                    \n                    Meredith Nierman/WGBH\n                    \n                \nhide caption \"It is shoulder to shoulder\" in Boston Common, WBUR's Deborah Becker tells Scott Simon on Weekend Edition Saturday. She describes the rally there as a \"sea of pink,\" referring to the pink knit caps that have become distinctive of the Women's March on Washington. The caps have come to be known as \"pussyhats,\" in reference to a tape in which Trump bragged about assaulting women by grabbing their genitals. Deborah reports that the message of the Boston protesters is one of solidarity with the primary march in Washington. They bear signs not only protesting Trump, but supporting a range of issues \u2014 from climate science to women's access to abortion and birth control. Both Massachusetts senators, Elizabeth Warren and Ed Markey, addressed the rally in Boston. \"I'm here to fight back!\" Warren told the crowd. \"We are in marches to say we are fighting back. That's who we are.\" Protesters make their way through Chicago during the city's women's march.\n                \n                    \n                    John Gress/Getty Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption In what the Chicago Tribune is reporting to be the largest crowd outside of Washington, Chicagoans gathered at Grant Park on Saturday morning with plans for a rally, followed by a march. In the end, the march portion of the event was cancelled by the organizers when they determined there were too many people to march safely. \"Our march route is flooded. There is no safe way to march. We are just going to sing and dance and make our voices heard here,\" march co-chairwoman Ann Scholhmer told the crowd, according to the Tribune. If participants were disappointed, they didn't show it. Organizer Liz Radford told the crowd, \"We called, and you came. We have flooded the march route. We have flooded Chicago.\" Source: NPR Credit:  Frank Langfitt Thousands marched through the British capital Saturday in what was billed as a women's march, but was ostensibly an anti-Trump rally. Marchers walked about 2 miles from the U.S. Embassy in Grosvenor Square to Trafalgar Square, within eyesight of Big Ben. The event ran for more than three hours and the size of the crowds easily dwarfed political rallies in the lead-up to last summer's Brexit vote here. As in other cities around the world, protesters carried signs criticizing America's 45th president. Many signs read \"We Shall Overcomb,\" referring to the U.S. president's signature hair-style. \"Trump Special Relationship? Just Say No,\" read others, referring to the historically close diplomatic ties between the U.S. and the United Kingdom. Many in this cosmopolitan, multicultural city \u2014 which voted heavily against the U.K. leaving the European Union \u2014 were already upset by Trump's election in November. The president's \"America first\" inaugural speech only fueled alarm here. A British software engineer named David said he watched the speech with officemates yesterday in stunned silence. \"It was a harrowing, chilling experience,\" David said, as he stood in front of London's National Gallery overlooking the rally in Trafalgar Square. \"The sense of nationalism and protectionism was there and there was quite a sinister undercurrent.\" David, who did not offer his last name, said he was disturbed by the insularity of the Trump's address, elements of which reminded him of the positions espoused by the political far-right here in the U.K. \"There is a movement in Britain called 'Britain first,' \" he said, \"which is a terrifying, horrible right-wing group.\" The march in London was among a number of anti-Trump rallies across Western Europe on Saturday, including cities such as Berlin, Paris, Belfast and Copenhagen. Participants hold signs as they wait for the start of the women's march in Los Angeles.\n                \n                    \n                    Justin Sullivan/Getty Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption \"I've never seen so many people standing in one place in Los Angeles in my life, and that includes sold-out Dodger Stadium,\" NPR's Ina Jaffe tells Michel Martin on Weekend All Things Considered. As the demonstrators marched from one rally in Pershing Square to another rally outside City Hall, Ina says a single street could not contain all of them. Instead, marchers had to proceed down three parallel streets. Supporters there brought up LGBTQ rights, religious freedom and women's rights, Ina reports \u2014 including one marcher who held up a sign with a picture of Carrie Fisher, which read: \"A woman's place is in the resistance.\" Thousands of participants converge on Dag Hammarskjold Plaza and Second Avenue during the women's march in New York City.\n                \n                    \n                    NY Daily News via Getty Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption For a march fueled in part by dissatisfaction with President Trump, it seems only natural that the protesters finished their procession nearby Trump Tower on Saturday. WNYC reporter Sarah Hayley Barrett tweeted that marchers shut down whole stretches of Madison Avenue, as they spilled off the planned route and took alternate paths to Trump Tower. Shumita Basu, a producer with WNYC, noted that in Dag Hammarskjold Plaza, where many of the protesters converged, the march was a \"sea of pink hats, signs.\" Several thousand at the #WomensMarch in Raleigh @wunc pic.twitter.com/jOmWEdMxTo \"There's been a steady stream of marchers\" in the streets of downtown Raleigh, reports Jess Clark of member station WUNC. \"It spans the spectrum \u2014 protesters represent diverse issues, diverse backgrounds.\" She notes that she has seen men in baseball caps, women in hijabs and several people in those distinctive pink caps. \"The massive crowd has taken over the downtown area, shutting down several streets in the process,\" The Associated Press reports from Raleigh. The news service notes marches and rallies are taking place in cities across the state, including Charlotte and Asheville. Mexicans and Americans marching in front of US Embassy M\u00e9xico City #WomensMarch pic.twitter.com/Yl5qdyV9Qx The march in Mexico City began at the U.S. Embassy and proceeded to the Angel of Independence monument. But, as NPR's Carrie Kahn reports, the march was so large, the crowd of demonstrators stretched from one landmark to the other. Carrie says the march comprised a mix of Americans and Mexicans, who appeared to be protesting Mexican President Enrique Pe\u00f1a Nieto as much as President Trump. Pe\u00f1a Nieto has dismal approval ratings in his own country; a recent poll showed only 12 percent of Mexicans approve of the job he's doing. The chants \u2014 shouted in both Spanish and English \u2014 focused not only on the two leaders, but women's rights and gender equality, as well. Organizers say a headcount shows 3327 people participated in this morning's #marchonsiouxfalls. #womensmarch pic.twitter.com/7jUq5QxK75 In Sioux Falls, the women's march has focused partly on American Indian rights, reports Kealey Bultena of South Dakota Public Broadcasting. Chants of \"Native lives matter\" rippled throughout the march. \"We want to protect Mother Earth, first of all, for the future generations and also we have our human rights as women,\" marcher Julia Brown Wolf told Kealey. Brown Wolf had traveled from the Crow Creek Indian Reservation for the demonstration. \"You know, we have to think in seven generations ahead.\" Kealey reports Brown Wolf marched with her granddaughters. \"She does not want them to face discrimination for being a woman or a Native American,\" Kealey says.

My son and husband are feminists.\" In Buenos Aires, American expats and locals held signs and wrote messages across their bodies as they gathered for a rally in support of the women's march. Local organizers echoed the guiding principle behind the march in Washington, D.C. \u2014 that \"Women's rights are human rights, and human rights are women's rights.\" Indian women in New Delhi participate in a nationwide \"I Will Go Out\" march to raise questions about safe access for women and marginalized communities in public spaces across India.\n                \n                    \n                    Chandan Khanna/AFP/Getty Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption While some protests are principally marching to express solidarity with the demonstrators in the U.S., others are directly raising issues of misogyny on a more local level.

Many of the filmmakers and movie-lovers in Park City for the annual event came to protest Donald Trump's presidency and to defend women's rights. They chanted slogans such as \"Love Not Hate, Make America Great\" and \"We live in Trumpled Times.\" Then they rallied as the snow flurried around them, with comedian Chelsea Handler and actress Maria Bello among the speakers. Longtime activist Dolores Huerta, who's the subject of a documentary that premiered at the festival, led the crowd in chanting, \"Si se puede, Yes, we can.\" Jessica Williams, who stars in one of the feature films premiering at the festival, told the crowd that her ancestors fought for her to be where she is \u2014 to \"stand in the snow in front of a bunch of white people in Uggs.\" \"I grew up thinking (the) civil rights movement already happened,\" said Williams. \"This election is a wake up call. The silver lining is, we are here ... in literally 21 degrees supporting each other.\" And all the way from Baltimore, the Lethal Ladies of Bliss step team, featured in a new documentary premiering Saturday, roused the crowd with foot-stomping chants of resistance.

He is working to build a United States explicitly for white people.\n                \n                    \n                    Ariel Zambelich/NPR\n                    \n                \nhide caption Jared Taylor promotes the idea that race is central to innate abilities and national success. He is working to build a United States explicitly for white people. Next week, white nationalists like Jared Taylor will celebrate a moment they've been waiting decades to see, when Donald Trump is inaugurated as the 45th president of the United States. Members of the white nationalist movement were among the first to embrace Trump's candidacy, and they celebrated after his election. \"Jan. 20 reflects a significant defeat for egalitarian orthodoxy,\" Taylor says. Taylor promotes a very different orthodoxy, one in which race is central to innate abilities and national success. He is working to build a United States explicitly for white people. Trump arguably helps this by telling supporters that they're the victims of a system rigged against them. \"I see Donald Trump as a kind of steppingstone. He is a step in the right direction in terms of understanding America and history and the world in essentially racial terms,\" Taylor says. But white nationalist enthusiasm for Trump has fallen off substantially. Since the election, the so-called alt-right has splintered, and the movement now looks a lot less potent than it once appeared. To understand that, it helps to go back to the heady days just after the election. \"It's too much winning! Could someone please just stop winning, I don't want to win anymore,\" Richard Spencer, who coined the term alt-right, told a room full of fellow radicals in November. Spencer said that Trump's victory had just slingshot white nationalism into the mainstream. \"And even if we're not quite in power yet we should act like it,\" he said. Richard Spencer, who coined the term alt-right, said that Trump's victory had just slingshot white nationalism into the mainstream.\n                \n                    \n                    Ariel Zambelich/NPR\n                    \n                \nhide caption But later that day, Spencer gave another speech, a fiery one that ended with some of the audience casting off any pretense of being mainstream. \"Hail Trump! Hail our people! Hail victory!\" Spencer shouted, raising his glass in a straight-arm toast to the audience. Some in the crowd responded with enthusiastic Nazi salutes, which captured media attention. \"Right after the election, I think it was euphoria,\" says Kevin MacDonald, a retired evolutionary psychology professor at California State, Long Beach and another white nationalist mainstay. \"But as we get into it now, there's more trepidation.\" MacDonald says Trump's appointments also have rattled the movement, especially his propensity for tapping rich Wall Street bankers. \"These are globalists in general. They love free trade, they love immigration \u2014 big red flags for us,\" he says. And MacDonald says he is concerned about the reliance on generals and hawkish policy leading America into another Middle East war. \"Lot of trepidation, but the big silver lining is Jeff Sessions,\" he says. MacDonald hopes Sessions, Trump's nominee for attorney general, will clamp down on immigration. White nationalists also like the nominee for secretary of state, Rex Tillerson, who is seen as being close to Russian leader Vladimir Putin, a darling of the alt-right. \"Right after the election, I think it was euphoria,\" says Kevin MacDonald, a retired evolutionary psychology professor, about the rise of the white nationalists. \"But as we get into it now, there's more trepidation.\"\n                \n                    \n                    Ariel Zambelich/NPR\n                    \n                \nhide caption But despite its high hopes for the Trump administration, the radical right has largely gone to war with itself. Mark Potok, with the Southern Poverty Law Center, says much of what was once called the alt-right has peeled away. \"I mean look, we are talking about a movement which spends literally more time attacking one another than they do attacking their enemies,\" Potok says. No one has taken more fire from his ideological kinsmen than Spencer. Like-minded radicals have disavowed the alt-right, even called Spencer an operative bent on the movement's destruction. In the media, he is always tied to those Nazi salutes. \"I think it's good to be the person talked about, even when it's negative,\" Spencer tells NPR. \"Our ideas are entering the discourse.\" But Marilyn Mayo with the Anti-Defamation League argues that the alt-right is watching its illusion of real world influence whither. \"At some point, they may have felt that they could influence policy in some way, but I think that was really a pipe dream for them because they really are a fringe movement, and they're still a fringe movement,\" Mayo says. A movement that sprang from obscurity with Trump's election seems to be dropping back into the shadows even before Trump takes power.",

            "article_content": "The mood in Brussels ranges from deep concern to outright fear as the European Union faces a critical U.S. president and upcoming votes in the Netherlands and France, where populists are campaigning to leave the EU.  ARI SHAPIRO, HOST: The European Union's supporters are worried. Later this month, British Prime Minister Theresa May will start the long process of withdrawing her country from the EU. We'll hear more about that in a moment. Elections are coming up in Germany and France and tomorrow in the Netherlands, and parties hostile to the EU are expected to make a strong showing. NPR's Frank Langfitt recently visited the EU's home city, Brussels, to gauge the mood there. FRANK LANGFITT, BYLINE: It's hard to overstate just how anxious people in and around the European Union feel right now. Just listen. DAVID MCALLISTER: The European Union is facing enormous challenges, probably the biggest challenges since we started our project 60 years ago. PAUL HOFFHEINZ: There's never been anything like this, not like this. LANGFITT: Not even the euro crisis. HOFFHEINZ: Oh, no, this is much more serious. ROLAND FREUDENSTEIN: In my lifetime, I have not seen this city so gloomy and so depressed about the future. LANGFITT: That's David McAllister, a German member of the European Parliament, Paul Hoffheinz - he's president of the Lisbon Council, an independent think tank here - and Roland Freudenstein, policy director at the Martens Centre for European Studies. It's the think tank of the European People's Party. (CROSSTALK) LANGFITT: Freudenstein chatted over beers at a Brussels pub, said people are turning to anti-EU parties out of frustration with the power the European wields over individual countries. FREUDENSTEIN: We have an increasing number of people that are going to vote for nationalist, populist parties which are openly anti-European and want to take their countries out of the European Union. And the big fear is that in one of these elections that are coming up, one of these parties will actually win. LANGFITT: Like Geert Wilders' Freedom Party in the Netherlands. Wilders hates the EU, as he described in this interview with the Christian Broadcasting Network. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) GEERT WILDERS: The European Union is a political bureaucratic organization that took away our identity and our national sovereignty. So I want to get rid of the European Union and be a nation state again. LANGFITT: Polls showed Wilders' Freedom Party leading for months, but recently it slipped into second place. Even if Wilders wins, he won't be able to become prime minister. That's because other leading parties won't work with him. What really worries the EU, though, is France, where Marine Le Pen's National Front, which also wants out of the EU, is very competitive and advanced in April's first round of voting. Again, Roland Freudenstein... FREUDENSTEIN: That's the make-or-break election. If Marine Le Pen wins that presidential election in France, we're in huge trouble. It may be the end of the European Union, and we're all aware of this. LANGFITT: EU critics - and there are many - see the trading bloc of 28 nations as a faceless, privileged bureaucracy seemingly ruling by fiat from the bubble of Brussels. But David McAllister, a European Parliament member for Germany, says people don't appreciate all it's accomplished. MCALLISTER: The European Union has brought peace and stability for more than 65 years now to at least North and Western Europe. The European Union is also an economic success story. The single market is the largest market in the world. LANGFITT: McAllister says the EU was built on the ashes of World War II to integrate economies and prevent more carnage in Europe. MCALLISTER: The most dangerous political poison in the world is nationalism, and when nationalism meets the anger of people, twice the world was at the brink of complete collapse. And it was actually twice that Americans had to come to Europe to end wars Europeans started. LANGFITT: Which is one reason Americans might want to keep an eye on this year's elections in Europe. As McAllister says, the United States has skin in the game. Frank Langfitt, NPR News, Brussels. Copyright \u00a9 2017 NPR.  All rights reserved.

            "article_content": "President Trump is getting a warm welcome in Poland. Also, the last battles of Mosul are down to street fighting, and pro-government groups attacked lawmakers in Venezuela.  RACHEL MARTIN, HOST: President Trump is praising Poland as a staunch U.S. ally. MARY LOUISE KELLY, HOST: Yeah, the president gave a speech in Poland. He is holding up Poland as an example for how to defend a democracy against outside threats, which is interesting because he also offered this criticism of Russia. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: We're working with Poland in response to Russia's actions and destabilizing behavior. MARTIN: All right, we're joined now by Geoff Bennett. He covers Congress and all things political for us. Hey, Geoff. GEOFF BENNETT: Hey, Rachel. MARTIN: So the president giving some remarks from Warsaw, Poland - what was his message? BENNETT: Well, he really tried to lay out sort of a broad vision for the U.S. relationship with Europe - and with Poland, in particular. But you played that clip with - about what he had to say about Russia. He also - during a Q&A, he refused to say that he believes Russia meddled in the U.S. election. This issue has come up before with him. He said he thinks it was Russia, but it could have been other countries. He says it probably was Russia, but nobody really knows. He more or less likened it to the ambiguity over weapons of mass destruction in Iraq. He said that the meddling in the election has been going on for a long time. So that's really some interesting backdrop for his sit-down with Vladimir Putin tomorrow. He also slammed news outlets, including CNN and NBC. He said that they were fake news. And then he stood by as the Polish president described why he's restricting Polish media outlets from covering Parliament. So this appearance in Poland was closely watched, in part because Poland's right-wing government has caused some anxiety, given its perceived crackdown on democratic institutions in that country. MARTIN: And Poland's president - I mean, he's a fan of Donald Trump. This was friendlier territory for Donald Trump than other European countries have been for him in the past. BENNETT: That's right. And it's one of the reasons why Trump chose to make Poland the first stop. He was more or less guaranteed a warm welcome. According to Polish media reports, the nationalist ruling party there bused in supporters to greet the president, guaranteeing a friendly crowd. It's a chance for him to look good on the world stage. But, you know, as you mentioned - more to your point, he - Trump is said to have a lot in common ideologically with Poland's political leaders because that party, the Law and Justice Party, rose to power by driving a populist movement. MARTIN: Yeah. BENNETT: You know, they stoked ethnic nationalism. They refuse to accept refugees. They muscled in on the media. And they've showed - they've shown, you know, disdain really for the European Union. So - and there was also a political calculation, too, for the reason why Poland is the first up. There are hundreds of thousands of Polish-American voters who live in battleground states like Michigan, Wisconsin and Pennsylvania. MARTIN: Which the president actually called out - he was like, thanks to all the Polish-Americans who turned out to vote for me. BENNETT: Right. And yeah... MARTIN: Let me - in our time remaining, let me just ask about the G-20 because there're a lot of one-on-one meetings happening. President Trump going to sit down with Angela Merkel. And, as you mentioned, he's going to have his first face-to-face with Vladimir Putin. Stakes are high for that meeting. BENNETT: Stakes are high for that meeting. And there will be confrontations inside and outside the summit. I mean, tens of thousands of protesters are expected. Trump has angered a lot of European allies by withdrawing from the Paris climate accord, for failing to back NATO's mutual defense pledge. So that will definitely be, you know, topics that are discussed. And then that meeting with the - with President Vladimir Putin that's now going to be an official bilateral meeting - even President Trump's top aides don't know precisely what he'll decide to say or if he's going to mention specifically... MARTIN: Yeah. BENNETT: ...Moscow's military aggression or its election meddling. KELLY: Always fascinating when a president steps onto the global stage - and as you say, Geoff, there's the audience watching in Moscow; the audience watching in Europe, where he heads to Hamburg tomorrow; and then of course the audience watching back here at home in the U.S. MARTIN: Here at home, yeah. Geoff Bennett, thanks so much for your time. BENNETT: You're welcome. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) MARTIN: We've been hearing for months now that the Iraqi city of Mosul is about to fall, that ISIS is about to be kicked out. KELLY: And just yesterday, Iraq's prime minister declared victory in Mosul. But the battle to retake the city isn't quite over yet. Civilians are still trapped. Pockets of ISIS fighters are dug into neighborhoods in the Old City. So what does this tentative declaration of freedom for Mosul mean for its people and for the bigger, broader fight against ISIS extremists? MARTIN: Jane Arraf is going to help us answer that question. She is covering this story from Irbil, Iraq. Jane, what can you tell us about where the fighting does stand now? We've got complete - competing claims - Iraqis saying it's victory, others saying not yet. JANE ARRAF, BYLINE: So here's the thing. It is a victory in a sense because we have to remember that ISIS came in almost three years ago. And the reason it managed to take Mosul was the army basically ran away. It fell under the weight of its own corruption. So for three years, Iraqi forces have been fighting and dying, and they have now reached that last half a square mile around the Old City, where they're fighting to dislodge the last of the ISIS fighters. But we also have to remember that this is, in many senses - in Iraq, and in Mosul in particular - the last stand for ISIS. They're surrounded, so they have nowhere else to go. So for a couple of reasons - the fact that it's their last stand, the fact it requires a lot of coordination between competing forces, and the U.S. can't really use a lot of airstrikes there - it is going to be a very tough few days. MARTIN: Can't use airstrikes because there are still so many civilians who are there. Any idea how they're faring and whether or not they are able to leave at this point? ARRAF: They're not faring well, and that's been one of the tragedies of this. This is Iraq's third-biggest city. It would be as if Chicago, for instance, were being shelled and had explosions going on and had the Army in there and then there was still everybody living inside. So now they've gotten to the last part of Mosul. There are still believed to be several thousand civilians. Now, here is one of the big problems - the military, the Iraqi military, believes most of these are not just ISIS fighters but their families. But they are, in fact, women and children, no matter who they are. And groups like Doctors Without Borders says a lot of civilians are dying on the battlefield. It is very dire there. MARTIN: So if we can assume that this battle is going to end, that Mosul will be rid of ISIS, what happens then? What happens for Mosul and the residents there? What happens to ISIS? ARRAF: Well, ISIS is gone from Mosul for the most part, although not entirely. We're seeing suicide bombers coming out with civilians according to the Iraqi military. But they're still in those areas in western Anbar, where American forces fought al-Qaida for years, and they're still along the Syrian border. And when they are driven out of Mosul, it is going to leave a country that's even more divided, more divided than it has been in years. And that's part of the reason that ISIS was able to come in in the first place. MARTIN: NPR's Jane Arraf covering the battle in Mosul from Irbil. Thanks so much, Jane. ARRAF: Thank you. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) MARTIN: Venezuela marked its Independence Day this week. KELLY: But anti-government protests overshadowed the holiday and took another violent turn. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) UNIDENTIFIED REPORTER: (Speaking Spanish). (SOUNDBITE OF GUNSHOTS) UNIDENTIFIED REPORTER: (Speaking Spanish). KELLY: What we're hearing there is a TV reporter in the National Assembly building. And what was happening was masked protesters stormed in with sticks and metal bars and attacked lawmakers who oppose the president, Nicolas Maduro. MARTIN: These clashes have obviously, Mary Louise, been happening for months now. KELLY: Indeed. MARTIN: So we're trying to figure out what exactly is the president's play, Nicolas Maduro. And to help us sort that out, we're joined by John Otis from the capital of Venezuela, in Caracas. Hey, John. So what happened? The photos from this event are horrible. I mean, these people were brutalized. How did these - how did this mob even get inside the building? JOHN OTIS, BYLINE: Well, you know, you - first up, you've got to remember that Venezuela's Congress - this is the only branch of government not controlled by the ruling socialist party. It's the only institutional voice of dissent in Venezuela. And President Nicolas Maduro, you know, he controls the courts, the - all the other branches of government. And so the Congress is really important. It's normally supposed to be the national guard who's protecting these guys and surrounding the building. I mean, I've been down there before. And to get into the Congress, you usually have to pass through several layers of national guardsmen who check your ID and so forth. So they usually have security there. But on Wednesday, lawmakers were meeting there. They're trying to figure out what to do about President Maduro. He wants to write a new constitution, and they fear that's going to kind of lead to a power grab to give him more power. Then yesterday... MARTIN: So the mob that went in there - they knew those conversations were happening. They were targeting specific lawmakers who'd been anti-Maduro. OTIS: That's exactly right. They were specifically going after anti-Maduro lawmakers. And they surrounded the - they crowded up against the gates. And really, there were no guardsmen in sight. And they just pushed through, got in there and started going after opposition congressmen who were meeting in there. It was really scary. It was kind of like watching a lynch mob go to work. MARTIN: So the guards were in cahoots, if they had just abandoned their posts? OTIS: Yeah, pretty much. I mean, the guardsmen - it's one of the many institutions that has become very politicized in Venezuela, and they basically answer to President Maduro. MARTIN: Wow. OTIS: And so, you know, you've got these crowds of people, and they're quite organized. They're called colectivos, and they're pro-government mobs, And they kind of do the government's bidding in a way. MARTIN: Well, in the big picture, what does this mean, John? I mean, the protests have been happening for a long time there in Venezuela. Protesters have been beaten; people have been injured. It feels different to have this security breach in the Parliament and to have these lawmakers bloodied. OTIS: Yeah. You know, it really is a new level of violence, I think, as you say. And, you know, one of the lawmakers who was down there was saying, you know, this is like, you know, this - imagine this happening on Independence Day. You know, you might compare it to - you remember the gunman going after the congressional baseball game... MARTIN: Yeah, yeah. OTIS: ...Say, that happening on the Fourth of July. MARTIN: On Independence Day would be horrible. We're going to have to leave it there. John Otis from Venezuela, thanks so much. Copyright \u00a9 2017 NPR.  All rights reserved.

DAVID GREENE, HOST: Yeah, Democrats took two important governor's races. Phil Murphy won in New Jersey, and Ralph Northam won in Virginia. And that race in Virginia got a lot of national attention. It was seen as sort of a test of President Trump's support, with Northam's campaign working to tie his opponent to Trump at each and every opportunity. Last night after his victory, Northam told reporters that the eyes of the country were on Virginia and that Virginians had spoken.

Really for a year - ever since Trump was elected, Democrats have been organizing across the state. They say that right after the election, they had a surge of interest in people running for state house. And - so this is not just about statewide races but also the House of Delegates. The whole - all 100 seats were up. And Democrats had candidates running in places that had not run one in a long time. And most of those seats - they picked up a lot of seats there, much better than expected. And they swept the statewide offices - this, Rachel, despite some real struggles in the past couple of weeks for Democrat Ralph Northam's campaign. He faced not just criticism from his Republican rival Ed Gillespie but also from the liberal wing of the Democratic Party. But he did win... MARTIN: He's a pretty centrist candidate. MCCAMMON: He is. He is. And there's some internal struggles there within the party. But you know, Rachel, he won handily. And he did that at least in part by, as we heard, painting this as a referendum on President Trump, both his policies and his rhetoric. MARTIN: At the same time, President Trump has now said - well, Ed Gillespie didn't win because he didn't tie himself close enough to me (laughter). What was... MCCAMMON: Right. MARTIN: ...Gillespie's strategy in this? MCCAMMON: It was a tough line to walk 'cause Gillespie, too, sort of has his roots in the moderate establishment wing of the party, although he moved to the right during the general election. He campaigned with Vice President Mike Pence. He did not campaign with President Trump. But Rachel, President Trump has been tweeting his support repeatedly for Gillespie in the last several days. And he recorded a robocall that went out in the final hours of the campaign promising that Gillespie would make America great again. And, I should say, Gillespie ran a pretty Trump-friendly campaign. He focused on things like crime and illegal immigration. MARTIN: So what does this mean for the Republicans moving forward? I mean, when we think about the midterms coming up, does Donald Trump help you or hurt you? MCCAMMON: That is still, I think, the big question. There are definitely those in the party that think that you've got to run a very pro-Trump campaign if you want to win. Gillespie kind of tried to do that and didn't win. But, you know, it's going to depend on the state. Virginia's an increasingly blue state, so we'll have to see. MARTIN: NPR's Sarah McCammon talking about the Virginia gubernatorial race. Democrats won in Virginia and in New Jersey - the governor's seat, we should say. Sarah, thanks so much. MCCAMMON: Thanks, Rachel. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) MARTIN: All right, President Trump arrived in China today. It's the latest stop on his Asian tour, where he's been looking to create a more unified front against North Korea. GREENE: Yeah. So Trump traveled to China from South Korea, where he tried to visit the demilitarized zone between the North and South. But thick fog prevented him from doing that. He was able to address South Korea's National Assembly, and here's what he had to say. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: All responsible nations must join forces to isolate the brutal regime of North Korea. To deny it and any form - any form of it, you cannot support, you cannot supply, you cannot accept. GREENE: And trying to figure out where that message was intended, China is the nation that has done the most to supply North Korea's regime. And now that Trump is in Beijing, the president is hoping to hear China's plans, if they are there, to intensify its efforts to isolate the North. MARTIN: All right, our co-host Steve Inskeep is in Beijing. Hi, Steve. STEVE INSKEEP, BYLINE: Hi there, Rachel. MARTIN: You've been there for - what? - over a week now? INSKEEP: Yeah. MARTIN: What's the scene like? I mean, it's a big visit to have the president of the United States come. What preparations have you seen taking place? INSKEEP: It's a big visit. But it's also a very big country, a place that's big enough and dynamic enough that I don't think people are necessarily as obsessed with President Trump as perhaps they are in some other places. There are other topics of conversation when you go out to dinner with people - although President Trump does come up - other topics partly because the country is so huge and changing so rapidly and partly, I should say, because criticism of the president is somewhat muffled here. His more embarrassing moments don't generally make the state media, which is not that critical of him at all. MARTIN: Trump has said that he's got this great relationship with the Chinese leader Xi Jinping. Does he? I mean, is he likely to get the red-carpet treatment? INSKEEP: Well, he's certain to get some good Chinese food. MARTIN: (Laughter). INSKEEP: And we're told that he is going to have dinner with President Xi Jinping in the Forbidden City - you know, this whole chain of imperial palaces, centuries-old, many of them made of red-painted wood... MARTIN: Yeah. INSKEEP: ...Old buildings now restored. Thousands, perhaps millions of tourists go through the Forbidden City, but no American president has received the honor of a dinner there since the founding of the People's Republic of China. That's the way it's being phrased. And I guess that would probably mean no U.S. president ever, since it would have been rare before the People's Republic of China that an American president would show up here. MARTIN: Right. So in your time there, what have you learned about these two men, Trump and Xi, about their different approaches? INSKEEP: Well, they both use the language of nationalism. They both talk about building a stronger country. They both especially lean on economic nationalism. But they've got different approaches to a lot of key issues, especially if you think about energy. Some examples we've come across in our reporting - China has a goal to be a leader in electric cars. President Trump doesn't seem interested in that. And his Environmental Protection Agency is actually working to rollback fuel efficiency standards. China's cutting back on coal as President Trump promises more. Trump withdrew from the Paris climate accord while China emphasizes they're going to honor it. And fairly or not, these differences have allowed President Xi to propose - to pose as the one who is the protector of the global order and the one who's looking to the future. MARTIN: Interesting - which would be something Donald Trump would not would not appreciate, I imagine. NPR's Steve Inskeep - we'll be hearing more of your reporting in the days to come. Thanks so much, Steve. INSKEEP: Glad to do it. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) MARTIN: As with most investigations, some pieces of information inevitably lead to more questions. GREENE: Yeah, that's really true. And this seems to be the case with the Texas shooting at that church. Police records show that the gunman, Devin Kelley, escaped from confinement at a mental health facility when he was stationed at a New Mexico Air Force base. Kelley was later picked up by police and handed over to local officers from New Mexico. But that report goes on to say an employee at the facility told police at the time, Kelley had tried to carry out death threats against his military commanders and had been caught sneaking firearms onto Holloman Air Force Base. MARTIN: All right, we're joined now in our studio by NPR Pentagon correspondent Tom Bowman. Good morning, Tom. TOM BOWMAN, BYLINE: Good morning. MARTIN: Why did this man, Devin Kelley, wind up in a civilian mental health facility while he was serving in the Air Force? BOWMAN: Well, I'm told in May 2012, he was given a psychiatric evaluation by the Air Force. They didn't have any facilities at home in the Air Force base for him, so he was sent to this civilian facility. He escaped, returned to the facility and then, five months later, went through his court martial. MARTIN: So this police report says that Kelley was caught sneaking firearms onto the base and making these really violent threats against his commanders. What does the Air Force say about this? BOWMAN: Well, the Air Force said there's really no evidence of either threats against commanders or any weapon-smuggling onto the base. But there clearly was evidence that he assaulted his baby stepson and also his wife. That's what he was charged with, assault, and convicted of that and then spent a year in jail and was given a bad conduct discharge. MARTIN: So because he had this history of domestic violence, the Air Force is supposed to put him - register him into this national database. You've been looking at this. I mean, if he had been put into that database, would this have prevented him from purchasing a gun from a licensed dealer? BOWMAN: Yes, it would have. Because he was given a sentence - he spent a year in jail - but the possibility of five years in jail for charge of assault and - plus of domestic abuse - those two reasons would have prevented him from buying from a licensed dealer. MARTIN: So was this just a one-off mistake? I mean, how - or is this a a bigger problem? BOWMAN: This is a big problem across the Pentagon. All the services - they're just not entering any of this data into the system. MARTIN: Why? BOWMAN: Well, we don't know. It's just a lapse. The only thing they add into the system are dishonorable discharges, 11,000 of them. But for the whole of Pentagon, they entered one felony and one domestic abuse. MARTIN: So we just don't understand the criteria of when they're supposed to enter it and when they don't and what (unintelligible) tells them. BOWMAN: Absolutely. And that's something that Congress is looking into, as is the Pentagon. MARTIN: And I imagine some folks in the military probably are going to be called to Capitol Hill to answer some questions... BOWMAN: Absolutely. MARTIN: ...Sometime soon. NPR's Tom Bowman. Thanks so much this morning, Tom. BOWMAN: You're welcome. (SOUNDBITE OF TRAMPIQUE'S \"VENUS\") Copyright \u00a9 2017 NPR.

            "article_content": "Scott Simon talks to NPR's Ron Elving about the week in politics, including President Trump's spat with the family of a deceased U.S. soldier and the Senate passing of a budget blueprint.  SCOTT SIMON, HOST: A week in which a political dispute may have overshadowed the memory of a soldier who gave his life. President Trump got into an ugly public battle over what he did or didn't say to the widow of Sgt. La David Johnson, who died on duty in Niger. This morning on Twitter, the president said the Florida congresswoman who criticized him was quote, \"wacky.\" Former President George W. Bush gave a speech that seemed a direct rebuke of President Trump's leadership. And the Senate passed a budget blueprint, possibly a first step to a tax overhaul. NPR senior political editor Ron Elving joins us. Ron, thanks so much for being with us. RON ELVING, BYLINE: Good to be with you, Scott. SIMON: And a pause to note and recall that Sgt. La David Johnson is being laid to rest today. His widow says that President Trump called her and told her that her husband, quote, \"knew what he signed up for.\" A Florida congresswoman says she heard the call and was outraged. And then the White House chief of staff, John Kelly, himself a Gold Star father, got involved and said the president's words were meant to be warm and admiring. Where does this leave us? ELVING: As of this morning, the president seems to be at war with Congresswoman Wilson. He is going on Twitter, as you say, to call her wacky and saying he hopes that the fake media will continue to pay attention to her because he says that she's destroying the Democratic Party. So what should've been a moment of shared mourning and tribute to Sgt. Johnson this week and today has turned into another difficult and depressing episode. And this one has ensnared even the chief of staff, John Kelly, in ways that he surely did not wish. SIMON: Yeah. John Kelly made some - in addition to delivering, I think, very moving remarks about what it's like to be a parent and lose a child, he stepped into the controversy by directing criticism at the congresswoman, didn't he? ELVING: He had been present at the dedication of a building in Florida. And he said that she had taken credit for the funding of that building. The videotape shows she did not do that. She took credit for speeding the naming of the building for a couple of agents who had sacrificed their lives. The White House was also poking fun at the congresswoman's dress and hat. And this just turned out to be the sort of thing that, if they were trying to distract from the original questions about what these soldiers were doing in Niger, why we were suddenly taking casualties in this part of the world where most people don't think the United States is engaged - and of course, the controversy over why it took so long for the president to acknowledge these deaths or to say anything to the families or to send any kind of message to them at all - if that was the purpose, well, I guess that has been accomplished. SIMON: Former President George W. Bush spoke out this week about what he called the casual cruelty of discourse today. He didn't mention President Trump by name. But it was hardly necessary. What did you note in his remarks? ELVING: He was saying that this administration appears to be intentionally divisive - that it used divisive tactics to win in 2016 within the Republican Party and then, of course, in the general election and that it pursues these tactics even now, despite the need to foster some unity in order to govern. Now, particularly talking about immigration, President Bush used the word cruel. And former President Obama also used that word. He also gave a speech this week that was pretty much his first outing in the political sphere, campaigning for a gubernatorial candidate. And both the former presidents were arguing that immigration had been a positive force in American history, building the country as we know it today. And both of them said that this current emphasis in this administration on nationalism was verging into nativism, the ultimate narrow vision of who is an American. SIMON: Senate passed a budget blueprint yesterday. They were determined to get this done, weren't they? ELVING: Yes, absolutely. Now, of course, this is necessary to set guidelines. The actual spending bills will come later. But the reason they were so eager to get this done is that it sets the stage and the rules for the tax overhaul bill that is going to dominate the rest of the year on Capitol Hill. And now, because of the rules that they pass, it is immune from a filibuster. And that means it can pass with just 50 votes, where they use vice president's tiebreaking vote to win. And that means that this tax bill actually has a fighting chance of happening later this year or early in 2018. SIMON: NPR's Ron Elving, thanks so much. ELVING: Thank you, Scott.

President Trump's threats to disrupt trade with Mexico aren't just worrying people south of the border. Each time Trump attacks the North American Free Trade Agreement, known as NAFTA, the executives at a 130 year-old railroad company in Kansas City, Mo., hold their breath. Like a lot of U.S. companies, cross-border trade accounts for a lot of Kansas City Southern's business. As the trains depart, they head south to Mexico, carrying American corn, chemicals and car parts. When they come back, they're loaded with items such as refrigerators, finished cars and beer. This is the daily scene for Kansas City Southern trains as they continue the old-school, steel-in-the-ground, heavy industry that was built slowly over decades and centered largely around trade with Mexico. \"They are the NAFTA railroad, so anything that's going to negatively affect potential trade with Mexico is going to be a negative for Kansas City Southern,\" says Jason Seidl, a railroad analyst with Cowen and Company. Seidl says Trump's presidency threatens that trade. Trump has targeted the nearly $60 billion trade deficit with Mexico by threatening to punish companies moving production there, and adding a tariff. As he told Scott Pelley on 60 Minutes, he's taking a hard look at NAFTA. Pelley: But there is a North American Free Trade Agreement. Trump: And there shouldn't be. It's a disaster ... we will either renegotiate it or we will break it. The stock market is up, sharply, since Trump's election, with investors betting that lower taxes and less regulation will boost most companies' bottom lines. The Dow Jones Railroad Index has climbed about 25 percent since the election. But, Seidl says Trump's protectionist threats have pushed down the price of Kansas City Southern stock. \"Uncertainty is sort of the No. 1 killer for stock performance, and that's what we have right now,\" Seidl says. \"We're one tweet away from it underperforming the group that day, and based on the president's current tweet rate, that could be a lot of tweets between now and the end of the year.\" And it's not just tweets. In January, Ford Motor Company executives announced they were canceling a $1.6 billion plant in Mexico. \"This was a big plant and it was going to be served by Kansas City Southern,\" says Tony Hatch, a senior transportation analyst with ABH consulting. \"It had business going north and south. And that would have been a minor blow \u2014 I think the symbolism makes it a major blow.\" Hatch says Kansas City Southern serves about a dozen other Mexican auto assembly plants, so losing one new one isn't crushing. But he says Trump is upending carefully laid plans, on both sides of the border. \"For Kansas City Southern, it's been very painful,\" Hatch says. \"They've done everything they could. They've invested a lot of money. They've created a really good network. So, all of the sudden, you're playing some kind of complicated game, and you get right to the point where you're going to be a leader in the game, and they say, 'Ah, sorry, here's a new set of rules.'\" Of course, NAFTA has long inspired fierce opposition, traditionally from the left, and opponents argue that a \"new set of rules\" is long overdue. NAFTA's been in place for almost a quarter of a century. Its critics say the agreement has cost hundreds of thousands of American jobs, and depressed American wages. Supporters say the trade agreement has boosted trade with Mexico enormously, and kept prices down for consumers. Andrew Selee, vice president at the Woodrow Wilson Center, argues that the free flow of capital and goods has actually preserved a lot of North American manufacturing. \"Getting closer together in trade is a good thing for all the economies,\" Selee says. \"We're able to compete against Europe and Asia, and other parts of the world. Few think trade between the U.S. and Mexico will shut down forever, but it's likely to change under this administration, in ways that seem increasingly hard to predict.",

            "article_content": "Some waters have receded in Houston and some people have returned to their homes, or what's left of them. Also, an update on the status of the DACA program for immigrants.  RACHEL MARTIN, HOST: Today marks one week since Harvey made landfall along the Gulf Coast. Today may also mark the first of many, many days of recovery in the region. MARY LOUISE KELLY, HOST: The death toll now stands at at least 36. And that could keep rising as rescuers access more homes and places that had been blocked by floodwaters. Now, speaking of homes, the White House says some 100,000 homes have been impacted by this disaster - either damaged or completely destroyed. Vice President Mike Pence made his first trip to tour the damage yesterday. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) VICE PRESIDENT MIKE PENCE: The challenges will be great. But we know that the generosity and the prayers and the faith of the people of Texas and the American people will be greater still. MARTIN: NPR's Nathan Rott has been bringing us coverage from Texas all week. He's back with us now. Hey, Nate. Let's start with the news of what is happening right now. I understand the waters - the floods - are starting to recede where you are. And the storm has now reached Tennessee. Give us the lay of the land. NATHAN ROTT, BYLINE: Yeah. I mean, so a couple of the quick developing stories that we're keeping an eye on here in going into the weekend - there's this chemical plant in Crosby, Texas. It's about - I don't know - about a half-hour's drive from where I am here in downtown Houston. To catch people up with that, there were fires and two explosions at that plant yesterday as these tanks filled with an organic peroxide overheated and blew up. Officials at that plant are now saying that eight more tanks could blow in the coming days. So that's obviously something to keep an eye on. Another thing we're watching is water availability and contamination. I saw last night that the town of Beaumont - that's about 70 miles east of here - it lost its water pumps to flooding yesterday, so there's no drinking water there. And then that's not to mention the big infrastructure issues, the damaged bridges, roadways and homes that are being revealed as these waters start to recede. MARTIN: So people are going back home. Or some of them are able to make that journey. Life kind of - I mean, it's not going to be normal for so long. But at least people are getting back to their properties? ROTT: Yeah. People are getting back. And, you know, I was thinking about this last night. You know, it is kind of going back to normal in some ways. But normal is good and bad. You know, this is going to take not months - years to clean up. MARTIN: Yeah. ROTT: And so you have people dealing with that - flooded homes, lost cars, property - just the trauma of this whole experience. And now you're starting to have people have to deal with these - you know, the day to day minutiae of normal life again. The adrenaline's wearing off. And people are realizing, hey, I still have to pay my phone bill, my car payment. It's the first of the month. So rent is due. And I think that's just really starting to sink in for people. And it's overwhelming. MARTIN: Yeah. You've been there all week. What have you been seeing, Nate, that we might not be able to see or understand from a distance? ROTT: You know, there's one thing that a bunch of us here on the ground have been talking about. And I'm going to try to do it justice real quick. But it's just how complicated the narratives are during something like this. I mean, I think from afar, you watch or listen to the news. You hear people who are victims, right? They've lost their home. They're evacuating - whatever it may be. And then you hear about the heroes - right? - the boat rescuers, the firefighters, the thousands of volunteers. But, really, here on the ground, there's no difference between those two groups. You know, we've met bus driver. There's a bus driver who is moving people from an evacuation center to another because her home was OK, and she wanted to help. And then on the bus, her home, she learned, was flooding. I could go on and on. I mean, the point is that there are people here on the ground who are all victims of this terrible, unprecedented storm. And almost everybody here is kind of a hero in their own little way. MARTIN: Everyone's hurting and helping at the same time. NPR's Nate Rott, who's been reporting from Houston all week. Nate, thanks so much. ROTT: Thank you, Rachel. MARTIN: Hundreds of thousands of people are bracing for a big decision regarding immigration here in the U.S. KELLY: That's right. The question is whether President Trump will end DACA. This is the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, which currently protects some 800,000 immigrants from deportation. These are the so-called DREAMers who came into the country illegally as children. Now, earlier this year, remember, the president spoke about the dreamers in a way that sounded like he empathized. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: They were brought here in such a way - it's a very, very tough subject. We are going to deal with DACA with heart. KELLY: OK. But, Rachel, back on the campaign trail Trump promised repeatedly to terminate the program. MARTIN: All right. So what is the fate of DACA? NPR's Scort (ph) - Scort. I just called you Scort. Scott Horsley. KELLY: (Laughter). MARTIN: I botched your name the other day. Hi, Scott. SCOTT HORSLEY, BYLINE: Good morning, Racquel. (LAUGHTER) MARTIN: Touche. Why is this question about DACA coming up right now? HORSLEY: Well, there's a group of conservative state attorney generals who have basically given the administration an ultimatum. They've said, end this program by next Tuesday, or they're going to file a lawsuit. They argue that DACA, which was put in place five years ago by the Obama administration, was an abuse of presidential power. That's the position that Trump himself took during the campaign. And while, as you heard, he has softened his position, the attorney generals want to essentially force the president to do what he promised during the campaign. MARTIN: So this deadline's approaching. What would it mean for Trump to simply take no action and let the deadline pass? HORSLEY: Presumably, the attorney generals would then follow through and file their lawsuit. And then, ordinarily, it would be up to the Justice Department to defend the federal government. Attorney General Jeff Sessions, however, is a hard-liner when it comes to immigration. So it's hard to imagine that his defense would be particularly vigorous. MARTIN: So what are the president's options on this, then? HORSLEY: He could continue the program as it is and let the federal court sort it out. He could offer the attorneys general some sort of compromise, where he says, OK, we're going to phase this program out. We're not going to issue any new work permits to these young people or other protections. And we're not going to issue any new ones. Or he could terminate the program abruptly and basically say to 800,000 young people, you are now immediately eligible for deportation. It's also possible that Congress would step in here with some sort of rescue and authorize a legislative protection for these so-called DREAMers that would get around the argument that this is executive overreach. That's probably a long shot. But there is a Republican lawmaker, Mike Coffman, from a swing district in Colorado who is pushing his legislative colleagues to do just that. MARTIN: So if DACA's terminated by the president or a court, what does that mean, in practical terms, for all the young people who right now depend on its legal protections? HORSLEY: Well, it might not mean an immediate knock at the door. But it is certainly the fear. You know, DACA was supposed to be a stopgap measure back in 2012 as Congress weighed more comprehensive overhaul of immigration policy. Young people took a chance. They identified themselves to the federal government. They came out of the shadows. In some cases, they indirectly identified family members, as well. And now there's a fear that they have put themselves and perhaps their families at risk. MARTIN: All right. NPR White House correspondent Scott Horsley reporting this morning on the future of DACA. Hey, Scott, thanks so much. HORSLEY: You're welcome. MARTIN: There's new political chaos in Kenya, where the Supreme Court has thrown out the results of last month's presidential election. KELLY: Yeah. This is something, Rachel. The elections commission in Kenya had found that the incumbent president - that's Uhuru Kenyatta - they found that he had won the election by a lot - by more than a million votes. And now today, the Supreme Court has ruled that, in fact, there were irregularities - enough irregularities to affect the integrity of the vote. MARTIN: All right. NPR's East Africa correspondent, Eyder Peralta, joins us now on the line from Nairobi. Eyder, step back a little bit and tell us how we got to this point here. EYDER PERALTA, BYLINE: Yes. So this was - you know, this started August 8, when the elections were held. And if you remember, you know, Uhuru Kenyatta won by a huge margin. And it's also worth noting that international observers said that this process was free and fair. But Raila Odinga, the opposition leader, claimed that there was a vast conspiracy to steal the election from him. And, I mean, some of it... MARTIN: So was he right (laughter)? PERALTA: Well, I think the court did not give any reasons for its decision. But - you know, so we don't know if the elections were hacked or that the court found that the elections were hacked. But I think as the case moved through court we saw some very serious evidence that something went very wrong here. I'll give you one example. There were tallying forms that were supposed to be filled out at the county level and these tallying forms had security features. One of them - you would hold a UV light on it, and it had a water mark on it. And what the court found - not what allegations were made by either party - but what the court found is that 20 percent of these forms did not have this watermark. So it just left open huge questions that we really don't have answers for... MARTIN: Yeah. PERALTA: ...As to where these forms came from and what happened to the forms that were supposed to be used. So - and the only thing the court told us is that they saw enough of those irregularities to warrant annulling this election. MARTIN: Wow. I mean, so this is huge. What happens now? I mean, I remember talking to you last month. Because of the protests by the opposition candidate, there was there was violence, right? So what happens now? PERALTA: There was. And so the court has ordered elections within the next 60 days. But I think the big question is the opposition is saying, we don't trust the elections commission who conducted this first election to do this again. So we'll see. MARTIN: (Laughter) We'll see. That's a lot packed into those few words. We'll see, indeed. Eyder Peralta - he is reporting this morning on the Supreme Court of Kenya's decision to overrule the presidential election results. That election happened last month. Eyder, thanks so much this morning. PERALTA: Thank you, Rachel. (SOUNDBITE OF EVIL NEEDLE'S \"CONSCIOUSNESS\") Copyright \u00a9 2017 NPR.  All rights reserved.

It was a pretty predictable first round of voting in the NPR Top Political Story of the Year Bracket. The top seeds all advanced easily. The only upset was 10-seeded Anthony Scaramucci's 10 days in the White House breezing past the far-more important New York Truck Attack, which was a 7-seed. But \"The Mooch's\" staying power in the bracket might turn out similarly to his stay in the White House \u2014 make a splash, but short-lived. That's because he's up against the 2-seed Charlottesville violence in the next round. (Charlottesville advanced easily, 97-3, over Majority GOP Support for marijuana legalization, a first.) There was one tie by percentage, No. 7 TPP torn up vs. No. 10 Trump says \"Pocahontas\" in front of Navajo Code Talkers. It turned out 50-50, but there was an odd number of votes, and Twitter says TPP won (though we were unable to see raw-vote totals.) Voting commences again at noon. Log onto Twitter and vote here.

Pick the winners by voting now. Updated at 2:10 p.m. ET So much happened in 2017, it's hard to believe. Ranking the top stories of the year is nearly impossible, especially with so many consequential, eye-popping and fast-moving things that happened. So we need your help in deciding which was the most important. To make it easy \u2014 and hopefully fun \u2014 we created an NCAA-style March Madness bracket for politics. You can vote here now in a contest that pits story against story in what was an almost unbelievable year in American politics. (The deadline to fill out a bracket has passed, but you can still get in on the voting.) You will get to decide the winner through Twitter polls, beginning with Round One, which is going on here for the  until midnight or so. The winner will be announced Friday afternoon, and we will update with results of each round each morning. (The prize for top-scoring bracket, announced on the Up First podcast \u2014 host David Greene's voice on your answering machine, er, voice mail. Or something else if that doesn't work out!) Here's a quick preview of the bracket to get you started: Here are the top seeds, known as \"The Chalk\" in college-basketball parlance. (\"Chalk\" is a relic of horse-betting that has survived. Read why here.): Sexual harassment fallout: This massive story has seen ramifications in every industry and is continuing. It has caused the downfall of a prominent U.S. senator, congressmen and weighed heavily in a defeat of a Republican for Senate in Alabama, leading to the state electing its first Democrat in a quarter century. Because of all that, it is our top overall seed. Comey fired: The former FBI director being fired was a massive story. It triggered a special counsel being appointed to investigate Russia's role in the 2016 election and any connections to the Trump campaign. Opponents and some allies of the president believe this was his biggest political blunder that could have consequences for his presidency in 2018 and beyond. Mueller Russia probe: Following on Comey's firing, another former FBI director, the well-regarded and meticulous Robert Mueller was appointed. And his dragnet has been wide, looking at meetings with Russian officials to Trump's finances, something the president once said would be something of a red line. The probe has pulled in multiple, high-ranking Trump officials, including his former campaign chairman and national security adviser, who has apparently been flipped. That means watch for more shoes to drop in 2018. Trump inaugurated: This is the tree almost everything in 2017 stemmed from. Citing \"American carnage,\" he set out a dark and brooding message that would trigger a sharp about-face not just from the Obama presidency, but the norms of almost of how American democracy and government has run for hundreds of years. Let's be honest: the No. 1 vs. No. 16 games amount to substance vs. click bait. Only one 16 seed has ever defeated a 1 seed in college basketball \u2014 that was Harvard defeating Stanford in the 1998 NCAA Women's Tournament. Will another be added to the list? It's unlikely \u2014 though, some on Twitter are threatening to advance \"Trump looks at eclipse\" over \"Trump inaugurated.\" But that just feels like trolling. It would very surprising if that happened. From early brackets that have come in, many can't seem to let go of Anthony Scaramucci's 10 days in the White House. (It is ironically \u2014 and unintentionally \u2014 a 10 seed.) In nearly every bracket, people have \"The Mooch's\" tenure defeating the far more serious and consequential \"NY truck attack.\" It's worth watching a couple strong middle seeds: No. 6-seeded \"Donald Trump Jr.'s email revelations,\" but it has a tough second-round matchup against the sweeping thematic category of \"Gun violence.\" And lots of people are also picking 5-seed \"Deportations/DACA\" to upset \"Trump inaugurated\" in the Sweet 16. Let us know what you think. Tell us if we're missing something on Twitter or the NPR Politics Facebook page.",

Updated at 6:52 p.m. ET Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell wants 2018 to be a year of bipartisanship, even if that means moving on from GOP dreams of cutting welfare and fully rolling back the Affordable Care Act. The Kentucky Republican on Thursday broke with House Speaker Paul Ryan, R-Wis., on the approach to paring back spending on programs like Medicaid and food stamps. In an interview with NPR, McConnell said he is \"not interested\" in using Senate budget rules to allow Republicans to cut entitlements without consultation with Democrats. \"I think entitlement changes, to be sustained, almost always have to be bipartisan,\" McConnell said. \"The House may have a different agenda. If our Democratic friends in the Senate want to join us to tackle any kind of entitlement reform, I'd be happy to take a look at it.\" McConnell said he wants to spend much of next year focused on issues on which Republicans can work with at least some Democrats in the Senate. \"This has not been a very bipartisan year,\" McConnell said. \"I hope in the new year, we're going to pivot here and become more cooperative.\" Republicans spent most of the year struggling, and failing, to follow through on promises to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare. Democrats refused to work with Republicans while they were trying to dismantle President Barack Obama's signature domestic achievement, and McConnell hopes that next year will be different. \"Well, we obviously were unable to completely repeal and replace with a 52-48 Senate,\" McConnell said. \"We'll have to take a look at what that looks like with a 51-49 Senate. But I think we'll probably move on to other issues.\" McConnell is referring to the political reality that the odds for legislation with only GOP support become longer in January when Sen.-elect Doug Jones, a Democrat from Alabama, takes office. Republican demands to gut the ACA also declined after Congress effectively eliminated the individual mandate by zeroing out the tax penalty in Obamacare as part of the tax bill approved this week. McConnell hopes to focus instead on stabilizing the insurance marketplaces to keep premiums from skyrocketing in the early months of 2018, a promise he made to moderate Republican Sen. Susan Collins of Maine to get her support for the tax bill. \"I think the repeal of the individual mandate takes the heart out of Obamacare,\" McConnell said. \"We want to steady the insurance markets if we can ... and I think we'll probably be addressing that part of health care sometime next year.\" Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina immediately pushed back on McConnell's comments. \"To those who believe \u2014 including Senate Republican leadership \u2014 that in 2018 there will not be another effort to Repeal and Replace Obamacare \u2014 you are sadly mistaken,\" Graham said in a statement and on Twitter. I\u2019m fully committed to Repealing and Replacing Obamacare in 2018 by block-granting the money back to the states and away from Washington bureaucrats who are completely unaccountable to the patients of America. After the major push to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act over the summer, Graham joined with Sen. Bill Cassidy, R-La., to promote a bill that would deconstruct the programs that make up the ACA and hand the funds over to the states to run their own programs. It would have gotten rid of the law's subsidies that help low-income consumers purchase insurance and the expansion of Medicaid that it allowed. McConnell also plans to spend much of the year persuading skeptical voters to embrace the GOP tax overhaul. Recent polls have shown that a majority of voters expect to pay more under the tax bill, a perception McConnell hopes to disprove in the coming months. \"I do think the coverage has been overwhelmingly negative, and it certainly has an impact on it,\" McConnell said. \"You take a family of four making $73,000 a year [that] will save about $2000. Now, to lot of people inside the Beltway that doesn't sound like a lot of money, but to that family, that's a 58 percent reduction in their tax bill.\" McConnell also expects bipartisan work will continue in the Senate probe into Russian meddling in the 2016 election. McConnell said he hopes the investigation will conclude in time to give voters confidence in the security of the elections process ahead of the midterm election in November. \"I'm looking forward to a recommendation from them, and I'm hoping that it will be a bipartisan recommendation,\" McConnell said. \"Because if it breaks into pure partisanship, no one's going to pay any attention to it.\" He also rejected the notion that President Trump is preparing to fire special counsel Robert Mueller. \"The only people that talk about that are the Democrats,\" McConnell said. \"But I don't hear anybody at the White House or any Republicans, and certainly not in the Senate, calling for Mueller to be fired.\"",

In her quarter-century in the U.S. Senate representing California, Dianne Feinstein has built a reputation as a bipartisan bridge builder, a collegial member of a legislative body that values seniority and, at least until recently, civility. But in the Trump era, a reputation like that may be a weakness, especially in California, home of the anti-Trump resistance where Hillary Clinton drew more than 60 percent of the vote last November. California State Senator Kevin de Leon delivers a speech on the first day of the Democratic National Convention , July 25, 2016 in Philadelphia.\n                \n                    \n                    Jessica Kourkounis/Getty Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption California State Senator Kevin de Leon delivers a speech on the first day of the Democratic National Convention , July 25, 2016 in Philadelphia. Ending months of speculation about his political future, State Senate President Kevin de Le\u00f3n of Los Angeles announced Sunday that he's challenging Feinstein. In an interview with KQED, de Le\u00f3n acknowledged that challenging Feinstein is \"akin to taking on the political monarchy, the establishment\" and described it as \"a David and Goliath battle.\" At 50 years old, the firebrand de Le\u00f3n will provide a striking contrast to Feinstein. In Sacramento, de Le\u00f3n has championed legislation to increase gun control and defend immigrants against harsh treatment by the federal government, including legislation making California a so-called sanctuary state, which Gov. Jerry Brown recently signed to severely limit local law enforcement's ability to cooperate with federal immigration officials. In a video announcing his candidacy, de Le\u00f3n emphasized his family's working class roots and his single, Guatemala-born mother who came to California from Mexico and \"worked her fingers to the bone\" cleaning houses to provide for the family. Accumulated clout versus biography Feinstein, the top Democrat on the powerful Senate Judiciary, can make the case that California can't afford to lose the clout she's collected over the past 25 years in Congress. She announced her long-anticipated decision to run for reelection last week. Dan Schnur, a former California Republican political operative, said anyone facing an incumbent with Feinstein's stature and leadership on issues like gun control would be extremely difficult to beat. \"That said, if any progressive Democrat is going to mount a serious challenge to Feinstein, it would probably be somebody with the kind of personal and political biography of de Le\u00f3n,\" Schnur said. \"He was raised in poverty, his parents were immigrants and he's been a very, very forceful progressive presence in the state legislature.\" Democratic campaign consultant Garry South agreed that Feinstein will be formidable, but he predicted de Le\u00f3n will match up well against the 84-year-old incumbent. \"He's young, very vigorous, very aggressive, articulate, dynamic and charismatic,\" South said. \"His personal up-by-the-bootstraps story will resonate with many voters.\" \"I think if you look at his record in the state as a senator and President pro Tem, Democratic voters are going to like that record a lot more than Dianne Feinstein's in the U.S. Senate,\" South added. Feinstein also starts out with considerable advantages, including sky-high name recognition, fundraising capacity, relatively positive approval ratings among voters and high profile endorsements from well-known Democrats, including Senator Kamala Harris. Out of step with Democratic base? But some Democrats say Feinstein is out of step with a Democratic base that's eager for a more confrontational approach to the Trump administration. De Le\u00f3n has already picked up some endorsements from fellow Democrats in the state legislature. \"Right now we have a president who has had California in the crosshairs since day one,\" de Le\u00f3n said. \"We have a president who is a threat to our economic prosperity to our progressive values and to our people.\" A few weeks ago, de Le\u00f3n was highly critical of Feinstein after she said people should give Trump more time. \"The question is whether he can learn and change,\" Feinstein said before an audience at the Commonwealth Club in San Francisco. \"If so, I believe he can be a good president.\" De Le\u00f3n, who is known around the Capitol by his initials \"KDL,\" told KQED at the time that \"we don't have much patience for Donald Trump here in California,\" adding that \"this president has not shown any capacity to learn and proven he is not fit for office. It is the responsibility of Congress to hold him accountable \u2013 especially Democrats \u2013 not be complicit in his reckless behavior.\" A few days later, Trump announced he was rescinding protections for so-called \"Dreamers,\" immigrants brought here illegally as children, reinforcing the impression by some that Feinstein was out of touch with the base of her party. De Le\u00f3n's entrance into the race could encourage other Democrats to run. The primary election in California is June 5, 2018.",

            "article_content": "There is anger among conservatives over reports of a deal between the president and Democratic leaders that would allow DACA recipients \u2014 brought into the U.S. illegally as children \u2014 to stay in the county and avoid deportation. Critics call it amnesty, and they are especially upset that the agreement that would also enhance border security, does not include building the border wall.  AILSA CHANG, HOST: Now let's look at how conservative media outlets are discussing the possibility of a deal between President Trump and Democrats on DACA. There's a lot of worry and some warnings. NPR national political correspondent Don Gonyea has this report. DON GONYEA, BYLINE: Supporters of President Trump often point to his reputation as a deal maker, but this possible bipartisan agreement on immigration isn't exactly what they had in mind. Here's how conservative talk radio king Rush Limbaugh put it on his show this afternoon. (SOUNDBITE OF RADIO SHOW, \"THE RUSH LIMBAUGH SHOW\") RUSH LIMBAUGH: So I wake up today and all hell is breaking loose. GONYEA: We'll get back to Limbaugh in a moment. But let's survey some of the other leading voices in conservative media. At Fox News, Sean Hannity, one of Trump's biggest supporters in cable TV, tweeted, quote, \"POTUS needs to stay the course and keep his promises or it's over.\" On the radio this morning, another staunch Trump backer, Laura Ingraham, was clearly not happy. She talked to her radio audience as the bumper music played under her voice. (SOUNDBITE OF RADIO SHOW, \"THE LAURA INGRAHAM SHOW\") LAURA INGRAHAM: Is that what y'all voted on, you voted for in November, to make Chuck Schumer happy? I have a feeling not. Not in Ohio, certainly not in Pennsylvania. Your goal... GONYEA: Ingraham derisively described the dinnertime meeting at the White House between Trump and the Democratic leaders as the supper club at 1600 Pennsylvania Ave. To her, the deal on DACA as described by Pelosi and Schumer sounds just like past immigration proposals that can't seem to stay dead. (SOUNDBITE OF RADIO SHOW, \"THE LAURA INGRAHAM SHOW\") INGRAHAM: And now, like the Freddy Krueger of all legislative policies, the same policy is back, except I think a lot of people didn't think it would be happening under the presidency of Donald J. Trump. GONYEA: Her callers weighed in as well, including Jody in Arizona. (SOUNDBITE OF RADIO SHOW, \"THE LAURA INGRAHAM SHOW\") JODY: Hey, Laura, this morning I have PTSD - Pelosi Trump Schumer Disorder. I am done if they don't build the wall. GONYEA: Meanwhile, over at breitbart.com, the website run by former Trump White House strategist Steve Bannon, one headline blared, quote, \"Trump caves on DACA, wants quick amnesty for 800,000 aliens.\" It continued on Breitbart's daily talk show on Sirius XM Satellite Radio. The guest was Jenny Beth Martin of the Tea Party Patriots. (SOUNDBITE OF RADIO SHOW, \"BREITBART NEWS DAILY\") JENNY BETH MARTIN: We voted for Donald Trump because we wanted something different than what Hillary Clinton was going to give this country. And the deal that we're hearing coming out of the White House is what we would expect Hillary Clinton to give us. GONYEA: The show's host, Raheem Kassam, showed his frustration when he asked this question. (SOUNDBITE OF RADIO SHOW, \"BREITBART NEWS DAILY\") RAHEEM KASSAM: What possibly can we do to get this presidency back on track? GONYEA: The Tea Party leader responded that Trump needs to hear loud and clear that this deal is unacceptable and that same message must be sent to Republicans seeking re-election. Now back to Rush Limbaugh. He actually suggested that everybody slow down for a moment. He cited the president's tweets that the deal is not done and that there will be a wall. And Limbaugh said the media likes this story so much for one simple reason. (SOUNDBITE OF RADIO SHOW, \"THE RUSH LIMBAUGH SHOW\") LIMBAUGH: They want you to think Trump has sold you out and thrown you under the bus. They want you to think that Trump has given away his mandate in exchange for doing deals. GONYEA: Don't jump to conclusions, he cautioned, though it's clear that a lot of Trump's supporters have done just that. Don Gonyea, NPR News Washington. (SOUNDBITE OF LYNX SONG, \"STOLEN\") ARI SHAPIRO, HOST: And you may have noticed a new voice on the program today. We're excited to have Ailsa Chang here filling in, hosting while Audie Cornish is on maternity leave. Ailsa, it's so good to have you here. CHANG: I am so thrilled to be here. This has been so fun. SHAPIRO: You want to tell us - tell us about one of the stories you're bringing to the show. CHANG: Well, we've spent a few days in Wisconsin. There's a big Supreme Court case that's coming up. It's about partisan gerrymandering in Wisconsin and whether or not too much politics was taken into account when they redrew the districts there. SHAPIRO: We will look forward to hearing that. And I look forward to hosting with you for the next couple weeks. CHANG: Thanks so much, Ari. Copyright \u00a9 2017 NPR.  All rights reserved.

The two now say they have worked out a deal with Trump on legislation.\n                \n                    \n                    Aaron P.

The two now say they have worked out a deal with Trump on legislation. Updated at 12:45 p.m. ET President Trump affirmed Thursday morning that a deal was in the works with Democrats that would protect some 800,000 DREAMers who could face deportation when DACA expires next year in exchange for \"massive border controls.\" It wasn't clear, however, whether a border wall would be part of an emerging pact, as Trump had seemed to suggest at one point. Early Thursday, he told reporters: \"The wall will come later, we're right now renovating large sections of wall, massive sections, making it brand new.\" Hours later, he said: \"We'll only do it if we get extreme security, not only surveillance but everything that goes with surveillance. If there's not a wall, we're doing nothing.\" The latest round of mixed messages comes after leading Democrats indicated Wednesday evening that they were close to a deal to save the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, which is scheduled to end in March. That appeared to be thrown into doubt when the president tweeted Thursday morning that \"no deal\" had been made, only to be followed by remarks to reporters that he and Democrats were \"working on a plan \u2014 subject to getting massive border controls.\" \"We're working on a plan for DACA. People want to see that happen,\" the president said at one point on Thursday. \"You have 800,000 young people, brought here, no fault of their own. So we're working on a plan, we'll see how it works out. We're going to get massive border security as part of that. And I think something can happen, we'll see what happens, but something will happen.\" Trump said Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer and House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, who had dinner with the president Wednesday night, \"agree with it.\" He added that he had spoken with Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and House Speaker Paul Ryan and they are \"on board.\" But that was followed Thursday by a suggestion that the issue of the border wall, a key campaign promise for Trump, could still derail the deal. \"Very important is the wall. We have to be sure the wall isn't obstructed,\" he said. In what might have been a response to the Breitbart-inspired hashtag #amnestydon, the president added: \"We're not looking at citizenship. We're not looking at amnesty. We're looking at allowing people to stay here.\" Right-wing news site Breitbart, with former White House adviser Steve Bannon back at the helm, had called the president \"Amnesty Don\" in a headline Wednesday. Schumer and Pelosi put out a statement Thursday acknowledging that a deal had yet to be finalized but said that the president's tweets suggesting otherwise were \"inconsistent\" with the partial agreement reached Wednesday night. \"As we said last night, there was no final deal, but there was agreement on the following: We agreed that the President would support enshrining DACA protections into law, and encourage the House and Senate to act,\" the joint statement from the House and Senate Democratic leaders said. \"What remains to be negotiated are the details of border security, with a mutual goal of finalizing all details as soon as possible.\" The latest characterizations of the evolving deal from both sides early Thursday followed considerable confusion. In a statement issued Wednesday night, Schumer and Pelosi said they would work on legislation with the president to fund security on the U.S. border with Mexico that excludes Trump's longtime promise of a wall between the countries \u2014 though the White House initially disputed the recounting of that portion of the meeting. The Democrats added that they \"urged the President to make permanent\" federal government subsidies under the Affordable Care Act and that \"those discussions will continue.\" The White House, for its part, called the dinner meeting \"constructive\" but didn't claim any breakthroughs. A White House official said that Trump and the lawmakers discussed multiple topics, including \"tax reform, border security, DACA, infrastructure and trade\" and that it was \"a positive step toward the President's strong commitment to bipartisan solutions for the issues most important to all Americans.\" White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders also denied that Trump had agreed to exclude the building of a border wall from any legislation. While DACA and border security were both discussed, excluding the wall was certainly not agreed to. Schumer's communications director, Matt House, responded that Trump \"made clear he would continue pushing the wall, just not as part of this agreement.\" Attorney General Jeff Sessions announced last week that the DACA program would be ending in March 2018 unless Congress took action to protect those affected. The administrative program, implemented by President Barack Obama in 2012, temporarily protected young people brought to the U.S. illegally as children from deportation if they met certain requirements. The program also let them apply for work permits but did not give them official legal immigration status. DACA recipients are often called \"DREAMers\" after a proposed-but-never-passed bill called the Development, Relief and Education for Alien Minors (DREAM) Act. As NPR reported last week, Sanders said Trump wants action to make the program permanent but only as part of a \"comprehensive\" immigration overhaul that would include ending illegal immigration, using a \"merit-based\" immigration system and preventing people from overstaying visas. Trump indicated Thursday that he didn't want to \"throw out\" the DREAMers and seemed to advocate for increased border security with any legislation. Does anybody really want to throw out good, educated and accomplished young people who have jobs, some serving in the military? Really!..... ...They have been in our country for many years through no fault of their own - brought in by parents at young age. Plus BIG border security On Wednesday night, Sen. Jeff Flake of Arizona congratulated the president \"for pursuing agreement that will protect #Dreamers from deportation.\" The Republican senator is particularly vulnerable in the 2018 elections, as NPR's Jessica Taylor noted Wednesday. But conservative Republican Rep. Steve King of Iowa, who has a history of making anti-immigrant statements, responded to the news with a tweet calling a potential deal \"Unbelievable!\" and adding that the \"Trump base is blown up, destroyed, irreparable, and disillusioned beyond repair. No promise is credible.\" The announcement came a week after Democrats said they reached a deal with Trump on providing hurricane relief, temporarily raising the debt ceiling and funding the government \u2014 a deal that upset Republican leadership. The prospect of Congress reaching an agreement on legislation to help DREAMers, however, is far from certain. NPR's Geoff Bennett explained: The DREAM Act has languished in Congress since it was originally introduced in 2001. Over the past 16 years, lawmakers have floated different versions of the bill. Each would grant permanent legal status to young immigrants who were brought to the country illegally, as long as they meet certain requirements. Republicans want broader immigration policy legislation, including tougher border security measures, to be part of any type of DREAMer protection. Bennett says the \"most likely path seems to be for Democrats to attach it to the must-pass fiscal legislation when it comes up again by early December.\"",

In announcing the president's decision to end the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, Attorney General Jeff Sessions stressed the legal arguments for that decision. But he also made the economic case for ending DACA, saying Tuesday that the beneficiaries of the program ended up denying jobs \"to hundreds of thousands of Americans by allowing those same illegal aliens to take those jobs.\" The overwhelming majority of DACA recipients are employed, according to a recent survey from the left-leaning Center for American Progress. But is it true that DACA recipients took those jobs at the expense of other Americans? The claim: \"It also denied jobs to hundreds of thousands of Americans by allowing those same illegal aliens to take those jobs.\" The question: Are DACA recipients taking jobs away from other Americans? The short answer: On a large scale or in the long run, there is no reason to think DACA recipients have a major deleterious effect on American workers' employment chances. What's more, some economists believe DACA is actually a boost to the economy. The long answer Logically, it makes sense to think that more immigrant workers would mean fewer jobs for other Americans. And there are indeed some workers who are negatively affected by immigration (more on this later). But when it comes to whether DACA recipients are taking jobs away from other Americans en masse, one top economist says there aren't facts to back that up. \"There is no evidence of that,\" said Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody's Analytics, about Sessions' statement. \"Repealing DACA is particularly wrongheaded as economic policy.\" There are a few reasons why this is the case. One is that the job market is relatively healthy right now. \"I think the primary thing that would argue against [Sessions' claim] at this point is, we are at full employment with more job openings than at any point in history,\" said Ray Perryman, president and CEO of the Texas economic research firm the Perryman Group. \"We desperately need workers in this country.\" On top of that, DACA recipients are relatively well-educated, meaning they have the capacity to make the economy that much more productive. In a January report, the libertarian Cato Institute predicted that eventually, the DACA population would look a lot like people who get H-1B visas (that is, visas for \"high-skilled\" workers): \"The majority [of DACA recipients] are still students and 17 percent are pursuing an advanced degree. By contrast, most recipients of H-1B visas are between 25 and 34 and hold either a Bachelor's Degree or a Master's Degree. In short, they appear to be a close reflection of what DACA recipients will look like a few years from now as they complete their educations.\" And if it's true that H-1B recipients and DACA recipients are comparable, many economists would say that those highly skilled workers would benefit the rest of the nations' workers in the long term. In a February survey from the University of Chicago, two-thirds of economists surveyed disagreed with the premise that \"if the U.S. significantly lowers the number of H-1B visas now, employment for American workers will rise materially over the next four years.\" None agreed. (The rest had no opinion or did not answer.) DACA beneficiaries also tend to be employed in higher-skilled jobs than workers who are in the country illegally. \"While the latter were heavily represented in jobs that involve manual work \u2014 such as construction and extraction, and building and grounds cleaning and maintenance \u2014 DACA-eligible workers were most commonly found in white-collar occupations that are usually done indoors in formal business settings,\" the Migration Policy Institute wrote in an August report. And to the extent that employers require or desire college degrees for those jobs, that labor market is even tighter. \"Right now, we have a relatively low level of unemployment, but among college-educated, we have an incredibly low level of unemployment,\" said Giovanni Peri, professor of economics at the University of California, Davis. \"So really, here you're kicking out workers in a part of the market which is probably already higher than full employment.\" Peri highlighted another issue with Sessions' claim. The idea that these several hundred thousand DACA workers are taking work away from several hundred thousand other people assumes that there is a fixed amount of work available. This is what economists call the \"lump of labor fallacy.\" \"The simple point \u2014 which is true for them but even more for them and all immigrants \u2014 if they were not there, the American economy would be 800 [thousand] young people smaller,\" Peri said. \"And the skills and productivity that they brought to the economy wouldn't be here.\" \"Population creates its own jobs in some sense,\" he said. Zandi has predicted (according to The New York Times) that in five years, the GDP would be $105 billion smaller without DACA recipients than with them. That is not much, considering that the nation's total gross domestic product is around $19 trillion per year. But it's nevertheless a hit that the U.S. could now be opting into. It's likely true that on an individual-by-individual level, there are some DACA recipients who have jobs that native-born or naturalized workers might otherwise have. And it's possible then, that if those DACA recipients no longer could work, there would be other people to take their places. And on the surface, that logic seems to make sense. But workers are also consumers \u2014 they spend their paychecks and grow the economy. Not only that, but these workers also bring with them skills and education and contribute to the economy. A (very) simplified version might go like this: The DACA recipient who works as an office manager might, for example, make his workplace more efficient, meaning that the firm might eventually have room to create another job. But take that DACA worker away, and the office has to find a replacement. That replacement could come along, but it also might not. Not only is the labor market tight for educated workers, but geography matters as well \u2014 that person would have to be there or be willing to relocate to get that job. DACA recipients are heavily concentrated in a few states, like California and Texas, so that might reasonably be where a lot of these hypothetical jobs would be. If the office can't find someone to replace that worker, it might decide to do without that hire. That leaves the economy with two fewer jobs than in the counterfactual. Of course, if DACA were indeed to end without a fix from Congress, these 800,000 beneficiaries wouldn't just disappear \u2014 some might eventually be deported, but that would take time. Others might seek off-the-books work. In that case, those workers might still contribute to the economy, but it could be a waste of those workers' productive capacity. And to the extent that those students were educated at U.S. schools, that would be productive capacity the U.S. will have helped to create. A big caveat This is not at all to say that having more immigrant workers leaves all other American workers better off. That same University of Chicago survey of economists also found in 2013 that while a plurality of economists agreed that having more low-skilled foreign workers in the U.S. would benefit the economy as a whole, it would be bad for low-skilled workers who are already here. (And as proof that this is not at all a cut-and-dried issue, on both questions, more than one-quarter of economists were \"uncertain.\") Likewise, there is some evidence that high-skilled immigrants (that is, those with H-1B visas) help pull wages down. And there are also cases where American workers have lost jobs to H-1B recipients. Harvard economist George Borjas laid out his perspective, balancing immigration's benefits and costs, in a Politico Magazine piece published months before the 2016 election. Borjas criticized candidate Donald Trump for misrepresenting his research in Trump's Republican National Convention speech. But he also chastised Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton for only presenting the positive side of immigration. \"Trump might cite my work, but he overlooks my findings that the influx of immigrants can potentially be a net good for the nation, increasing the total wealth of the population,\" he wrote. \"Clinton ignores the hard truth that not everyone benefits when immigrants arrive. For many Americans, the influx of immigrants hurts their prospects significantly.\" Sources: Brannon, Ike and Logan Albright, \"The Economic And Fiscal Impact Of Repealing DACA,\" Cato Institute, Jan. 18, 2017 Capps, Randy, Michael Fix, and Jie Zong, \"The Education and Work Profiles of the DACA Population,\" Migration Policy Institute, August 2017 Corkery, Michael, \"'Dreamers' Find Allies In Trump's Business World,\" The New York Times, Sept. 4, 2017 \"High-Skilled Immigrant Visas,\" IGM Forum, University of Chicago Booth School, Feb. 14, 2017 Maciag, Mike, \"MAP: How Ending DACA Could Play Out Across States,\" Governing magazine, Sept. 5, 2017 Phone interview with Giovanni Peri, Sept. 5, 2017 Phone interview with Ray Perryman, Sept. 5, 2017 Email interview with Mark Zandi, Sept. 5, 2017",

Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., and Dick Durbin, D-Ill., spoke about their Dream Act to help protect DACA recipients at a press conference on Tuesday. Updated at 11:58 a.m. ET With President Trump's announcement on Tuesday that his administration is ending the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, the White House made clear it wants a legislative solution from Congress to protect the roughly 800,000 \"DREAMers,\" who came to the U.S. illegally as children and now could face the possibility of deportation. There are several pending bills in Congress, spearheaded by both Republicans and Democrats, that could gain more steam now that Trump has made the decision to wind down the program in six months. DACA was first implemented by President Barack Obama in 2012 via executive action after Congress failed to pass either a comprehensive overhaul of the nation's immigration laws or a bill that would have provided protections to immigrants who came here illegally as children \u2014 through no fault of their own \u2014 and have no criminal record. While Congress could pass a stand-alone bill to just address DACA, White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders hinted in her briefing on Tuesday that Trump wanted \"comprehensive reform\" and dodged on whether Trump would sign a bill addressed just at DREAMers. In a tweet later Tuesday, Trump seemed to signal he wanted a broad overhaul of the immigration system and didn't single out DACA specifically. I look forward to working w/ D's + R's in Congress to address immigration reform in a way that puts hardworking citizens of our country 1st. \"I have a love for these people and hopefully now Congress will be able to help them and do it properly, and I can tell you, speaking to members of Congress, they want to be able to do something and do it right,\" Trump had told reporters just hours earlier. \"And really we have no choice, we have to be able to do something, and I think it's going to work out very well, and long term it's going to be the right solution.\" He later left open a chance that he could reconsider the wind-down if legislators reach an impasse. Congress now has 6 months to legalize DACA (something the Obama Administration was unable to do). If they can't, I will revisit this issue! If Congress decides to act to help DREAMers before their protections under DACA expire, there are several bills pending that could achieve that end. But with Congress set to juggle many major tasks over the next month \u2014 including providing disaster funding for victims of Hurricane Harvey, raising the debt ceiling, providing funding for the government after Sept. 30 to avoid a shutdown and addressing the White House's push for a tax overhaul \u2014 it's unclear how much political capital GOP leaders will have to spend on such a bill. House Speaker Paul Ryan, R-Wis., has signaled his willingness, but Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., has not. And the legislative branch has not shown an ability this year to pass anything of consequence. Here's a rundown of some of the pending legislation: Dream Act, sponsored by Sens. Dick Durbin, D-Ill., and Lindsey Graham, R-S.C. The senators held a press conference Tuesday afternoon after the Trump administration's announcement, saying they are pushing for action by the end of September on their latest iteration of the Dream Act. While Durbin was highly critical of Trump's decision, Graham said he believed it was the right decision, because he thought Obama had overstepped his legal authority by issuing the far-reaching executive action. Graham said he believed Congress would be pushed to act. \"The reason I think it will get done now is that the leadership of the Republican Party, including the president, realizes it's good for the country economically and otherwise to give these kids the certainty they need in their lives,\" Graham said. According to the National Immigration Law Center, the Dream Act of 2017 has many of the same protections in place as DACA does and also creates a path for citizenship or permanent legal resident status if applicants meet certain requirements. DACA did not provide such a path. Qualifications for permanent status in the Dream Act include having lived in the U.S. for a certain length of time and meeting certain educational, work or military service requirements. It would take at least 13 years for those eligible to achieve citizenship. However, the White House has already signaled it won't support this bill: When Graham and Durbin proposed it in July, Trump's legislative affairs director, Marc Short, said, \"I think that the administration has opposed the Dream Act and likely will be consistent on that.\" Recognizing America's Children Act, sponsored by Rep. Carlos Curbelo, R-Fla. The Miami congressman's plan, which he introduced in March, similarly takes much of what was in DACA and codifies it, while also providing a pathway toward legal status and, eventually, citizenship. \"The bill provides immigrants that have been vetted by the Department of Homeland Security with three pathways toward legalization: higher education, service in the armed forces or work authorization. Following a 5-year conditional status, these immigrants would be able to reapply for a 5-year permanent status,\" Curbelo said in a press release announcing the bill earlier this year. At the end of their permanent status \u2014 after a total of 10 years, according to the NILC \u2014 DREAMers could apply for citizenship. \"These are young people that went to school with our own children; they are working in this country; they are contributing to this country; they speak English,\" Curbelo said Tuesday on CNN's New Day. \"This is the only country that many of them remember. So we should afford them \u2014 as long as they're willing to be productive members of society, which most of them are \u2014 we should afford them the opportunity to be fully recognized as Americans and to gain legal status in this country.\" Curbelo represents a majority-Hispanic district that went for Democrat Hillary Clinton by 16 points over Trump last November \u2014 making Curbelo a major target in the 2018 midterms. The American Hope Act, sponsored by Rep. Luis Gutierrez, D-Ill. Gutierrez introduced this bill in July, flanked by the Congressional Hispanic Caucus; 112 Democrats already had signed on to cosponsor his legislation. To be eligible, people must have entered the U.S. before age 18. The bill does not include any work, education or military requirements but does reject people who have been convicted of certain crimes, according to the NILC. It also provides the fastest path to citizenship. Those eligible can apply for conditional permanent residency, valid for up to eight years, and after three years can apply for lawful permanent residence status. After a total of five years, they can apply for U.S. citizenship. \"DACA is under threat, and we know that President Trump and the attorney general, if he is still in office, will not lift a finger to defend DACA,\" Gutierrez said back in July. \"This will replace the order in the lives of these young people with chaos. It will replace the hope they have for their futures with despair. It substitutes cruelty for their aspirations and the aspirations of our entire immigrant population. All of us here support DACA. We fought for DACA and we will defend DACA. And the defense includes putting on the table legislation that charts a way forward.\" BRIDGE Act, sponsored by Rep. Mike Coffman, R-Colo. As soon as news broke over the weekend that Trump was going to end DACA, Coffman announced he planned to file a discharge petition to get his bill to the House floor. The rarely used method requires a simple majority of signatories to circumvent party leaders and bring a bill up for a vote by the full House. The BRIDGE Act \u2014 which stands for Bar Removal of Individuals Who Dream and Grow our Economy \u2014 was proposed back in January and essentially would codify the current DACA program into law and extend it for three years, allowing Congress more time to come up with a comprehensive, long-term solution for overhauling the nation's immigration laws. Unlike the other bills in Congress, it does not include a path to citizenship. \"The members of Congress have a choice: They can let the program be phased out and these young people be subject to deportation, or they can sign this petition for the BRIDGE Act,\" Coffman told The Denver Channel on Monday. \"The federal government knows where they are, so if there are deportation proceedings, they could be expedited.\" Like Curbelo, Coffman is also facing a tough re-election campaign in 2018; he serves a district that Clinton won by 9 points.",

Obama reacted strongly to President Trump's reversal of the policy. Former President Barack Obama criticized the Trump administration for once again casting a shadow of deportation over young people who were brought to the country illegally as children. Obama renewed his call for Congress to grant permanent protection to these so-called DREAMers. \"To target these young people is wrong, because they have done nothing wrong,\" Obama wrote in a Facebook post. \"It is self-defeating \u2014 because they want to start new businesses, staff our labs, serve in our military, and otherwise contribute to the country we love. And it is cruel.\" The former president rarely criticizes his successor in public. But Obama has weighed in occasionally when Trump acted to reverse one of his signature initiatives, such as the Affordable Care Act or the Paris climate agreement. Trump's decision to phase out protection for DREAMers, beginning in six months, drew a similar response. Obama rejected the administration's claim that its action was driven by a legal challenge from conservative states. \"Let's be clear,\" Obama said. \"The action taken today isn't required legally. It's a political decision and a moral question.\" Obama himself acknowledged back in 2012 that granting DREAMers a temporary reprieve from deportation was an imperfect substitute for legislation. \"This is not amnesty,\" he said at the time. \"This is not immunity. This is not a path to citizenship. It's not a permanent fix.\" Obama had turned to executive action reluctantly after legislation known as the DREAM Act was stymied by a Republican filibuster in the Senate in late 2010. One of the bill's most outspoken opponents was then-Sen. Jeff Sessions. \"American people did not vote for an amnesty in this past election,\" said the Alabama Republican, now Trump's attorney general, who made the policy announcement Tuesday. \"It will be resisted with every strength and every ability that I have to do so. Because this is a lame-duck Congress, it will not pass next year, and it's not going to pass this year if I have anything to do about it.\" With the DREAM Act stalled, Obama eventually decided to move on his own, granting the DREAMers a temporary reprieve from deportation. Young people who met certain criteria were allowed to apply for temporary legal status and a work permit. The move was controversial from the beginning. Even as he was announcing the program in the White House Rose Garden, Obama was interrupted by a writer from the conservative Daily Caller website. \"Why do you favor foreigners over Americans?\" asked Neil Munro, a question that would foreshadow Trump's \"America First\" rhetoric. Roy Beck, head of the group Numbers USA, which favors limited immigration, worried that giving work permits to DREAMers would cost native-born residents jobs. \"Is there anybody in America who believes that the 20 million unemployed or underemployed Americans need more competition?\" Beck asked in 2012. The unemployment rate at the time was 8.2 percent. It's since been cut nearly in half to 4.4 percent, despite the DREAMers' presence. Nevertheless, Sessions argued Tuesday that Obama's order had \"denied jobs to hundreds of thousands of Americans by allowing those same illegal aliens to take those jobs.\" Obama rejected that sentiment five years ago. \"It makes no sense to expel talented young people who, for all intents and purposes, are Americans,\" he said in 2012. \"\"These young people are going to make extraordinary contributions, and are already making contributions to our society.\" Obama echoed that sentiment Tuesday in his Facebook post. \"Whatever concerns or complaints Americans may have about immigration in general, we shouldn't threaten the future of this group of young people who are here through no fault of their own,\" Obama wrote. \"Kicking them out won't lower the unemployment rate, or lighten anyone's taxes, or raise anybody's wages.\"",

Her immigration status made finding financial aid for college complicated.\n                \n                    \n                    Joel Rose/NPR\n                    \n                \nhide caption Desiree Armas (center) and her parents, Olga and Carlos Armas, left Peru when Desiree was 3 years old. Her immigration status made finding financial aid for college complicated. This story is part of Kitchen Table Conversations, a series from NPR's National Desk that examines how Americans from all walks of life are moving forward from the presidential election. Desiree Armas worked hard in high school. So when she graduated in June from Union County Magnet High School in New Jersey, Armas had the flair to prove it. She was decked out in medals and honor cords \u2014 braided ropes with tassels on the end, in bright red and gold, that represent her academic and extracurricular accomplishments during high school. \"I always admired the kids who wore a bunch of stuff on graduation,\" Armas says. \"So that's why I think I was so excited for graduation, just to low-key show off everything I've done.\" But there was one big difference between Desiree Armas and the rest of her graduating class: Armas and her parents are living in the country illegally. Armas is signed up for the DACA program \u2014 Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals \u2014 which protects her from deportation. Still, her immigration status made applying to college more complicated than she expected. Desiree Armas graduated in June from Union County Magnet High School in New Jersey wearing medals and honor cords that represent her academic and extracurricular accomplishments.\n                \n                    \n                    Courtesy of the Armas Family\n                    \n                \nhide caption Desiree Armas graduated in June from Union County Magnet High School in New Jersey wearing medals and honor cords that represent her academic and extracurricular accomplishments. Even the college counselor at her high school was overwhelmed. \"I like my counselor. I really do respect her and, yes, she tried her best,\" Armas says. \"But I mean it's, like, the first time she ever had to deal with something like that. Having to consider my immigration status. And she just didn't know how to deal with that.\" While her classmates were committing to colleges, Armas was still trying to figure out if she could afford college at all. In some states, DACA students are eligible for state aid. New Jersey isn't one of them. So while Armas was admitted to a couple of schools \u2014 including Rutgers, the state university \u2014 the schools weren't offering enough financial aid to make it work. \"It was extremely sad to see Desiree so defeated,\" says her mother, Olga Armas, through a translator. \"And we felt guilty, because we brought her to this country.\" Desiree Armas left Peru with her parents when she was 3 years old. They eventually settled in Elizabeth, N.J. Part of the problem with Armas' college applications was confusion over how to fill out her federal financial aid form, because her parents don't have Social Security numbers. That's not unusual, says Nedia Morsy, an organizer at the nonprofit Make the Road New Jersey, which works with DACA students. \"There's an education and responsibility that they need to have more than other students,\" says Morsy. \"They need to have an awareness of what monies are available to them, and how. And then plan college applications around that. So money comes first, and the dream school comes after.\" Morsy helped Desiree Armas get her financial aid paperwork straightened out. And she knew about another school in New Jersey that Armas hadn't applied to: Saint Peter's University, a small private college in Jersey City. \"St. Peter's offered me a full ride,\" Armas says. \"They even called me saying, your application is, like, one of the best we've seen all year. They invited me to their honors college and they were, like, really excited for me to go. And right off the bat I really liked St. Peters.\" Desiree Armas got some other good news in June: DACA will continue, at least for now. So after years of not knowing where \u2014 or if \u2014 she was going to college, Armas says, it was a relief. She felt like all her hard work was starting to pay off.",

Still basking in the glow of a big Georgia special election victory for the GOP, President Trump pushed aside the controversies that have hamstrung his administration in the past month and returned to the stage most comfortable to him \u2014 the campaign trail. \"All we do is win, win, win!\" he told the crowd gathered in Cedar Rapids, Iowa, on Wednesday night. It was classic campaign Trump throughout his hour-plus stemwinder, decrying the \"phony witch hunts going against me,\" hitting the \"dishonest media,\" doubling down on his pledge to build a border wall and reliving his November victory. At the outset, Trump boasted about how Republicans had been counted out in the Tuesday contest in Georgia's 6th Congressional District, framed as a referendum on his agenda. But in the end, GOP nominee Karen Handel ended up topping Democrat Jon Ossoff, and in South Carolina, Republican Ralph Norman rolled to a closer-than-expected finish in another special election. \"The truth is people love us, all of us. They love us. [Democrats] haven't figured it out yet,\" Trump said. It was the president's fifth campaign rally since he was inaugurated in January. The frequent returns to the campaign trail are a huge deviation from past presidents, but they give Trump a chance to recharge and connect with his supporters. All of his rallies have been sponsored by his re-election committee. Trump's speech began remarkably on-message and upbeat, without some of the dark imagery painting a sullen country he is known to use. \"History is written by the dreamers, not the doubters,\" he told the crowd, urging them to \"set aside the cynics and the critics.\" Their presence there tonight, Trump said, was evidence that the country was \"more unified than ever before.\" \"All you want is a government that shows you the same respect and loyalty in return,\" the president said. \"You believe that America must protect and defend its own citizens. With that conviction, deep in your hearts, you showed up on Election Day and voted to put America first.\" On the health care bill that Senate Republicans are set to unveil on Thursday, Trump said he hoped they \"surprise you with a good plan,\" but one with \"heart.\" And, he laughed, \"add some money to it!\" He began to acknowledge he would like Democratic support in the effort to repeal and replace former President Barack Obama's signature achievement. \"If we had even a little Democratic support, just a little, like a couple of votes, you'd have everything,\" Trump said. But then he began bashing the opposing party, quipping that \"I am making it a little bit hard to get their support, but who cares?\" And from then on, it was freewheeling Trump as he jumped from topic to topic, strayed off message, made some head-scratching remarks and revisited some old campaign trail favorites. In talking about his cadre of advisers, he boasted about their financial pedigrees \u2014 even though he had slammed Hillary Clinton on the campaign trail for being too close to those same interests. \"We have Gary Cohn, who is the president of Goldman Sachs. He's the president of Goldman Sachs. He had to pay $200 million in taxes to take the job, right? So, somebody said, 'Why did you appoint a rich person to be in charge of the economy?' I said, 'Because that's the kind of thinking we want,' \" Trump said, adding that Cohn and other multimillionaires in his Cabinet had to \"give up a lot\" in taking administration jobs, going from \"massive paydays to peanuts.\" \"And I love all people, rich or poor,\" the president continued. \"But, in those particular positions, I just don't want a poor person, does that make sense?\" He also slighted wind power as a reliable energy source \u2014 \"I don't want to just hope the wind blows to light up your homes\" \u2014 even though Iowa is the highest producer of wind energy in the U.S., accounting for almost a third of its energy production. Trump also said he will soon propose a new immigration rule that anyone seeking to come to the U.S. has to be able to financially support themselves and not use welfare resources for five years. However, as The Hill noted, that law already exists. It was passed in 1996 under President Bill Clinton.",

            "article_content": "Amid mixed messages, a half-million young immigrants brought to the U.S. illegally as children are in jeopardy of losing their protected status under President Trump's administration.  MICHEL MARTIN, HOST: We want to check in now on the program that gave protected status to a half a million young immigrants who came here illegally as children. They have to reapply every two years for an Obama administration program that allows them to stay. They've been able to work and study without fear of being deported. Now, though, the program's future is in doubt. And some worry they put themselves and their families at risk by signing up in the first place. NPR's Richard Gonzales reports. RICHARD GONZALES, BYLINE: Every day, the Department of Homeland Security processes several hundred applications under the program known as DACA, or Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals. Federal officials say the pace has not dropped off under the new administration. On the campaign trail, Donald Trump pledged to end the program. But since taking office, he has softened his rhetoric. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: We're going to show great heart. DACA is a very, very difficult subject for me, I will tell you. To me, it's one of the most difficult subjects I have because you have these incredible kids. GONZALES: Still, many DACA recipients, the so-called DREAMers, are worried. Just ask Maria. She's an 18-year-old freshman at San Francisco State University. Nearly one third of DACA recipients like Maria are in California. Her parents brought her across the Mexico border illegally when she was 4. MARIA: I feel like the unknown is frightening because you really don't know what to prepare for. GONZALES: Maria is sitting in the student center, taking a break between midterm exams. She asked that we not use her full name because she does not want to call attention to her case. She said the government already knows where she lives and where her parents live because she had to supply that information to apply for DACA. MARIA: The government has easy access to our house, so it leaves me with, like, a sense of - it's frightening. I'm scared. Just thinking about it makes me, like, get the chills. GONZALES: Trump has vowed to ramp up deportations of unauthorized immigrants. And under a little-noticed provision in one of his executive orders on immigration, the president stripped non-citizens of federal privacy protections. Immigrant advocates worry that data collected under DACA can now be used to find and deport people in the country illegally. STEPHEN YALE-LOEHR: I think we have mixed messages. GONZALES: Stephen Yale-Loehr is a Cornell University law professor. YALE-LOEHR: President Trump personally may feel that DACA recipients should be low priority for deportation, but the new executive orders give individual immigration enforcement officials a lot more discretion than before. GONZALES: Many immigrant advocates and attorneys are advising young people to wait to see what Trump does before applying for the first time. But those already in the program have more to lose by dropping out. Maria, for instance, is on a scholarship that's contingent on her DACA status. Scores of colleges and universities are offering DACA students legal referrals, psychological counseling and even help crafting emergency plans in case their families are deported. Norma Salcedo directs San Francisco State's Dreamer Resource Center, which opened just after Trump's election. NORMA SALCEDO: If they're feeling anxious because they don't have an emergency plan, we will help them with that. GONZALES: Opponents of the DACA program are just as frustrated with the Trump administration. Mark Krikorian is executive director of the Center for Immigration Studies, a D.C.-based group that advocates for limits on all immigration. He contends DACA amounts to unconstitutional amnesty. MARK KRIKORIAN: They're literally just kicking the can down the road and hoping the problem somehow resolves itself. That to me suggests there is no strategy. They don't have a plan on how to deal with DACA, at least not yet. GONZALES: That's little comfort to Miguel, another San Francisco State student who asked that we not use his last name. He fears the day he'll get a call from home telling him that his parents in Southern California have been detained because they're here illegally. MIGUEL: A few of my friends, one by one their parents are getting detained. And for, like, the rest of us, it feels like it's just a waiting game. GONZALES: Miguel is a senior who will graduate this year with a degree in graphic design. If Trump terminates DACA, Miguel says he would probably set aside his career ambitions and work in a job like construction, where he can get paid under the table.

            "article_content": "White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer says President Trump will focus on the \"renewal of American spirit\" when he addresses a joint session of Congress early next week.  MICHEL MARTIN, HOST: Let's start the program today looking ahead to President Trump's first address to a joint session of Congress that happens Tuesday. So as a part of our regular feature, Words You'll Hear, we want to take a look at some of the words you'll hear in the speech or that you will hear to describe it. According to the White House, the theme will be, quote, \"the renewal of the American spirit,\" unquote. For more on how Donald Trump is likely to express that idea, we're joined now by NPR national political correspondent Mara Liasson. Mara, thanks so much for joining us once again. MARA LIASSON, BYLINE: Happy to be here. MARTIN: So in his inaugural address, Donald Trump spoke about American carnage in a speech that really took a lot of people aback for its deeply negative tone on an occasion that usually calls for the opposite. So what do you make of this talk of the American spirit now? LIASSON: I'm not sure what to make of it. You know, Sean Spicer, the press secretary, said in addition to laying out his vision, Trump will also talk about what he's accomplished already. That I understand because Trump routinely says he's done more than any other president in American history. But Trump's aides told us before the inaugural speech that it was going to be about unity, but it turned out it wasn't at all. It was very dark and dystopian, as you said. It sounded like the blow torch was being passed to a new generation, as some journalists quipped. So I don't know when they preview a kind of more optimistic Sunday speech if it's going to turn out to be exactly that. MARTIN: Well, if they are saying or if they're suggesting that the address will be optimistic, does this indicate an acknowledgement that the tone of the inaugural address, perhaps, did not strike the right tone, that perhaps the president needs to strike a more positive or optimistic tone? LIASSON: There are definitely people who think that he needs to do that. His approval rating is very low, and they believe, especially Republicans in Congress, that if he's going to ask members of Congress to cast tough votes, it's going to be harder and harder if his approval rating continues to be low. So that's the rationale to be more positive and more inclusive because so far, Trump has mostly spoken to his base - might have succeeded in getting his base to be even more loyal and enthusiastic about him, but there's no doubt he has shrunk his support. He won with 46 percent and now he's hovering anywhere from 38 to 42. And that's historically low, by the way. No president has ever dropped during their first month or gotten this low. MARTIN: So tell us - remind us if you would about what the purposes of a speech like this - it is tradition. LIASSON: It is tradition, and traditionally the president comes new - brand new president to give policy direction to Congress, to tell his members of Congress, Republican members what he wants them to do as they try to craft tax reform and health care reform. And the problem is that Republicans have put themselves inside a kind of a Rubik's cube because they have to repeal Obamacare first in order to get the money to pay for those huge tax cuts. They could make Medicaid less generous to get some money for tax cuts or they could scrap subsidies. The problem is that Donald Trump hasn't provided them with a lot of guidance about what he wants for Obamacare beyond what the White House said this morning which is that the goal is that no one loses coverage. The problem is that Obamacare is getting more popular by the day, and Republicans still haven't figured out if they repeal it what do they want to replace it with. MARTIN: Well, aside from health care, you've also mentioned the other big priority is tax reform. We've heard House Speaker Paul Ryan and the president have been actually split on their approaches. So where does that sit? LIASSON: Well, the big split was about something called a border adjustment tax, basically a tax on imports not exports. That's something that House Republicans want. In the past, the president has described the border adjustment tax as being too complicated. But last week for the first time, he said in a Reuters interview it could lead to a lot more jobs in the U.S. And Paul Ryan took that as a quasi-endorsement. And the reason why this is important for Republicans is the border adjustment tax generates a lot of money. And that could help pay for tax cuts, but it splits the Republican's business coalition because businesses that import goods don't like it at all, like retailers. Businesses that export like it, and the other big question that I'm looking for Donald Trump to answer on Tuesday night is does he just want tax cuts or does he want tax reform? Tax reform is where you lower rates, but you also get rid of a lot of deductions, so rich people, for instance, end up paying pretty much the same even though they're paying a lower rate. And we don't know if Donald Trump is a tax cutter or a tax reformer. MARTIN: Before we let you go, Mara, we have to ask about how we think Democrats are going to respond to this event Tuesday night. LIASSON: I think they're going to be quiet and sullen, and they're going to be bringing a lot of guests who represent groups they believe the president threatens. House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi says she's going to bring a dreamer, the mother of a victim of gun violence and someone she says is going to be a symbol of freedom of the press. There's also going to be a Democratic response to the speech which is interesting. Two people are going to respond - the first former Kentucky governor Steven Beshear. Kentucky is a place where there are a lot of those white working-class voters, a lot of coal miners. And Kentucky has a very popular Obamacare program called Kynect. And the second Democratic response is going to be delivered in Spanish from Astrid Silva who is a dreamer and an immigrant's rights advocate. So you've got that contrast teed up pretty clearly. MARTIN: That's NPR's Mara Liasson. Mara, thanks so much. LIASSON: Thank you. Copyright \u00a9 2017 NPR.  All rights reserved.

In an impromptu 30-minute interview with The New York Times on Thursday, President Trump said 16 different times that there has been \"no collusion\" proved in the Russia investigation. Trump also asserted he will win re-election in 2020 because the media need him for ratings and made inaccurate claims about his role in the Alabama Senate race, the state of the Affordable Care Act and more. As for that special counsel investigation, while some Trump allies have actively tried to undermine the Mueller probe, in the interview Trump hewed closely to what his own lawyers have been saying. \"I think that Bob Mueller will be fair, and everybody knows that there was no collusion,\" Trump said. According to the Times, there were no aides on hand as Trump spoke with reporter Michael S. Schmidt about a wide range of topics in the Grill Room at his golf club in West Palm Beach, Fla. The president didn't conduct a traditional end-of-year news conference, so this interview offers a look at what Trump is thinking as he heads into 2018. NPR reporters and editors have combed through the interview excerpts transcribed by the Times. Their annotations follow. You can also jump to the following sections: Russia investigationJustice DepartmentTaxesHealth careImmigrationForeign policyAlabama Senate raceCampaigning for president Defining collusion: \"There is no collusion, and even if there was, it's not a crime.\" NPR's Ryan Lucas: When people say \"collusion,\" they're generally using it in a colloquial sense to refer to secret coordination that would include criminal conduct. But Trump is right \u2014 collusion is not a crime. However, there's another C-word that comes into play here \u2014 \"conspiracy\" \u2014 and that is a crime. Now, it depends on how Mueller's investigation shakes out, but there are a few possible conspiracy charges that could come into play in the special counsel's probe. One is conspiracy to violate the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act, and another is a more general conspiracy charge: to defraud the United States. Special counsel's fairness: \"No, it doesn't bother me because I hope that he's going to be fair. I think that he's going to be fair. And based on that [inaudible]. There's been no collusion. But I think he's going to be fair. And if he's fair \u2014 because everybody knows the answer already, Michael. I want you to treat me fairly. O.K.?\" NPR's Tamara Keith: President Trump's description of the investigation closely mirrors that of White House special counsel Ty Cobb's. \"I think it's been highly professionally done,\" Cobb said of the investigation in an interview with NPR in November. \"And I think they have moved with an alacrity that they're proud of and that the American people can be proud of.\" Under Cobb's guidance, the White House posture has been full cooperation with the investigation, with an insistence that it will be over soon and the president will be cleared.  This is in contrast to some of the president's allies who have been actively trying to undermine the investigation. Feinstein's comments: \"I saw Dianne Feinstein the other day on television saying there is no collusion. She's the head of the committee.\" NPR's Keith: Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., is the ranking member of the Senate Judiciary Committee; Sen. Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, is the chairman. On Nov. 5, Feinstein appeared on CNN's State of the Union following the guilty plea of former Trump campaign aide George Papadopoulos. Charging documents described conversations Papadopoulos had with Russian-linked individuals where he was promised \"dirt\" on Hillary Clinton, as well as hacked emails. Feinstein was asked whether she had seen any evidence of that dirt or emails being given to the Trump campaign. \"Not so far,\" Feinstein responded. A month later, though, in an interview on NBC's Meet the Press, Feinstein said she believed an obstruction of justice case was coming together against the president. \"I see it in the hyperfrenetic attitude of the White House, the comments every day, the continual tweets. And I see it most importantly in what happened with the firing of Director [James] Comey, and it is my belief that that is directly because he did not agree to 'lift the cloud' of the Russia investigation. That's obstruction of justice,\" Feinstein said. \"They made the Russian story up\": \"So for the purposes of what's going on with this phony Russian deal, which, by the way, you've heard me say it, is only an excuse for losing an election that they should have won, because it's very hard for a Republican to win the Electoral College. ... So the Democrats. ... [Inaudible.] ... They thought there was no way for a Republican, not me, a Republican, to win the Electoral College. Well, they're [inaudible]. They made the Russian story up as a hoax, as a ruse, as an excuse for losing an election that in theory Democrats should always win with the Electoral College. The Electoral College is so much better suited to the Democrats [inaudible]. But it didn't work out that way. And I will tell you they cannot believe that this became a story.\" NPR's Keith: It is true that the Electoral College map in recent elections has been favorable to Democrats \u2014 not \"always.\" However, it is simply not true that the \"Russian story\" is a hoax cooked up by Democrats to explain away Clinton's loss. The U.S. intelligence community, with a high level of confidence, has concluded that Russia did interfere in the 2016 election, hacking emails, using troll farms to amplify fake news that was favorable to Trump and intended to hurt Clinton, and pumping out its own anti-Clinton propaganda on Russian state-owned television and YouTube channels. Even among members of his own administration, Trump is virtually alone in insisting that Russian interference in the election is a hoax. What Trump often conflates when he says that the \"story\" is a \"hoax\" is the idea of \"collusion\" with Russian interference overall. He has cast doubt on and left open the possibility that Russian interference didn't happen, but he has not outright dismissed it. Trump has not been consistent on Russia's role in the election. At times, he has questioned whether the Obama administration's response was adequate. In July, he said, \"I think it was Russia\" and \"others also.\" Trump also said, after speaking with Putin in Asia in November, that he believed that Putin meant it when he again denied interfering. Purview over Justice Department: \"What I've done is, I have absolute right to do what I want to do with the Justice Department. But for purposes of hopefully thinking I'm going to be treated fairly, I've stayed uninvolved with this particular matter.\" NPR's Carrie Johnson: The president is the ultimate boss of Attorney General Jeff Sessions and other Justice Department leaders. But norms and guidelines enforced widely after the Watergate fiasco have meant that only a few people inside the White House may contact only a few people at the Justice Department. Those policies are supposed to insulate prosecutors and FBI investigators from political interference. DOJ law enforcement decisions, such as whether to bring criminal charges, are supposed to operate independent of political decision-making. But several times in 2017, President Trump himself or someone in his White House has reportedly reached out to FBI or DOJ officials about particular matters. And the president's lawyers maintain he has the ultimate authority over federal investigations, whether or not it is wise to use it. Loyalty and the attorney general: \"I don't want to get into loyalty, but I will tell you that, I will say this: Holder protected President Obama. Totally protected him. When you look at the I.R.S. scandal, when you look at the guns for whatever, when you look at all of the tremendous, ah, real problems they had, not made-up problems like Russian collusion, these were real problems. When you look at the things that they did, and Holder protected the president. And I have great respect for that, I'll be honest, I have great respect for that.\" NPR's Johnson: While former Attorney General Eric Holder once declared himself President Obama's \"wing man\" and called the president a friend, he also maintained that the Justice Department's law enforcement duties operated independent of the White House. Prosecutors did decline to bring charges over the IRS scandal in the Obama years, to the dismay of Republican lawmakers. As for the ATF gun-running scandal known as \"Fast and Furious,\" it prompted a shake-up at the ATF and a congressional contempt citation for Holder. But no evidence emerged that either the White House or Obama had a role in that failed operation. Working with Democrats: \"So. ... We started taxes. And we don't hear from the Democrats. You know, we hear bullshit from the Democrats. Like Joe Manchin. Joe's a nice guy. ... But he talks. But he doesn't do anything. He doesn't do. 'Hey, let's get together, let's do bipartisan.' I say, 'Good, let's go.' Then you don't hear from him again.\" NPR's Keith: In a recent interview with Politico, Sen. Joe Manchin, D-W.Va., was critical of the president's approach to the tax bill, going with a partisan process that relied on Republican votes alone for passage. \"I was an easy pickup. Very easy pickup,\" Manchin said. \"And a couple, two, three other Democrats would have been easy pickups, if they had just made an effort.\" In the end, not a single Democrat voted in favor of the tax bill. State and local tax deduction: \"Had they come to me for a bipartisan tax bill, I would have gone to [Majority Leader Mitch McConnell], and I would have gone to the other Republicans, and we could have worked something out bipartisan. And that could've been either a change to SALT or knockout of SALT.\" NPR'S Keith: This is a fascinating maneuver by the president. In a way, he is absolving himself of blame, and instead pointing fingers at both Democrats and members of his own party for new limitations on the deductibility of state and local taxes in the new GOP tax law. He is blaming Democrats for not playing ball, and blaming Republicans for insisting on limiting the deductions. The limits on state and local tax deductions are expected to disproportionately affect high-cost areas in blue states. A handful of Republican representatives in the House voted against the tax bill because this provision would hurt their constituents. But other Republicans saw this as a way to punish high-tax states or even push them to lower taxes, reducing the reach of government at the state level. Individual mandate: \"You know the individual mandate, Michael, means you take money and you give it to the government for the privilege of not having to pay more money to have health insurance you don't want. There are people who had very good health insurance that now are paying not to have health insurance. That's what the individual mandate. ... They're not going to have to pay anymore. So when people think that will be unpopular. ... It's going to be very popular. It's going to be very popular.\" NPR's Keith: The individual mandate, which requires people to buy health insurance, is a largely unpopular part of the Affordable Care Act. The law also requires people to pay a fine if they do not have health insurance. With the new tax bill, Republicans eliminated the fine (technically the mandate to have insurance still exists, but the enforcement mechanism goes away). In 2015, according to the IRS, 6.5 million taxpayers were hit with the penalty. The average payment was $470. Millions more received federal subsidies to help offset the cost of the insurance they did purchase. According to NPR's Shots blog: \"The Congressional Budget Office has estimated that dropping the requirement would result in 13 million fewer people having insurance over 10 years.\" Premiums are also predicted to rise as healthier people drop insurance. Association health plans: \"We've created associations, millions of people are joining associations. Millions. That were formerly in Obamacare or didn't have insurance. Or didn't have health care. Millions of people. That's gonna be a big bill, you watch. It could be as high as 50 percent of the people. You watch. So that's a big thing. And the individual mandate. So now you have associations, and people don't even talk about the associations. That could be half the people are going to be joining up.\" NPR's Keith: Trump is referring to an executive order he signed in October calling on various federal agency heads to \"consider proposing regulations or revising guidance\" to expand the availability of association health plans; short-term, limited-duration insurance; and health reimbursement arrangements. Trump speaks as if this executive order is already in full effect and millions of people have signed up for association health plans as a result. That is simply not the case. \"The regulations for these new association health plans have not yet been proposed, let alone implemented,\" Larry Levitt of the Kaiser Family Foundation said in a tweet. \"So unless we're in a time warp, people are not yet covered by them.\" Levitt is co-executive director of the Program for the Study of Health Reform and Private Insurance and is a noted expert on the U.S. health care system. In another tweet, he pointed out that many questions remain about how these plans would be regulated. The news site Vox wrote a detailed explainer about the policy implications. DACA and the wall: Schmidt: \"It sounds like you're tacking to the center in a way you didn't before.\" Trump: \"No, I'm not being centered. I'm just being practical. No, I don't think I'm changing. Look, I wouldn't do a DACA plan without a wall. Because we need it. We see the drugs pouring into the country, we need the wall.\" NPR's Amita Kelly and Joel Rose: Trump has reason to become more \"practical\" on immigration: He has been unable to secure funding to construct his U.S.-Mexico border wall from either Congress or Mexico. He has, however, remained steadfast that a border wall is needed. His administration is moving to end DACA, which protects about 700,000 people brought illegally to the U.S. as children. But he has called on lawmakers to protect those immigrants through a larger immigration overhaul. Polls show wide support for allowing so-called DREAMers to stay in the country. Here are five immigration stories to watch in 2018, including DACA and the border wall. \"Chain migration\": \"We have to get rid of chainlike immigration, we have to get rid of the chain. The chain is the last guy that killed. ... [Talking with guests.] ... The last guy that killed the eight people. ... [Inaudible.] ... So badly wounded people. ... Twenty-two people came in through chain migration. Chain migration and the lottery system. They have a lottery in these countries.\"They take the worst people in the country, they put 'em into the lottery, then they have a handful of bad, worse ones, and they put them out. 'Oh, these are the people the United States. ...' ... We're gonna get rid of the lottery, and by the way, the Democrats agree with me on that. On chain migration, they pretty much agree with me.\" NPR's Kelly and Rose: What Trump calls \"chain migration,\" immigration advocates call \"family reunification.\" It describes the way most immigrants come to the U.S. \u2014 someone immigrates and, in turn, sponsors family members. Trump is apparently referring to Sayfullo Saipov, who allegedly killed eight people after plowing a truck into a crowd in Lower Manhattan in November. Saipov is a legal resident and came to the U.S. from Uzbekistan in 2010 on a diversity visa, not through a family connection. The diversity visa program, which issues 50,000 visas per year, was created for people from countries that have sent relatively few immigrants to the U.S. They apply and are vetted before being entered in a lottery. It's not a program that allows countries to put the \"worst people\" into a lottery. Trump has called for a merit-based system that would preference highly skilled workers. A suspect in a different New York attack \u2014 Akayed Ullah, who is accused of setting off a bomb near the Port Authority in December \u2014 was in the U.S. on a visa available through family connection. Democrats aren't necessarily on board with Trump's desire to eliminate chain migration. New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio said following the subway bombing that many New Yorkers were in the U.S. because they \"were allowed to come after the first family members got here. ... If we're now talking about a new generation of immigrants who are, in many cases, people of color ... suddenly it's 'chain migration,' and it's a bad thing.\" And Trump has blamed Democrats \u2014 specifically Sen. Chuck Schumer of New York \u2014 for creating the diversity visa lottery program. Though, as NPR has noted, it had bipartisan support at the time. Spending in the Middle East: \"Michael, we have spent, as of about a month ago, $7 trillion in the Middle East. And the Middle East is worse than it was 17 years ago. ... [Inaudible.] $7 trillion.\" NPR's Domenico Montanaro: This is higher than Trump said during the campaign. He would pin the cost of what the U.S. has spent in the Middle East after the Sept. 11 attacks as $6 trillion. That, PolitiFact noted in October 2016, \"is confusing money that's been spent with money that researchers say will be spent. That's a $1 trillion difference or more.\" That's because of money that is estimated to be spent on veterans' care over the next half-century. Welcome in China: \"I like very much President Xi. He treated me better than anybody's ever been treated in the history of China. You know that. The presentations. ... One of the great two days of anybody's life and memory having to do with China.\" NPR's Montanaro: In the 4,000-year history of China, this is a sweepingly hyperbolic claim. Without delving into the pomp China has provided past foreign dignitaries, it's worth pointing out that former President Richard Nixon is largely responsible for the normalization of relations with China and was received warmly in 1972. Oil going to North Korea: \"It was very recently. In fact, I hate to say, it was reported this morning, and it was reported on Fox. Oil is going into North Korea. That wasn't my deal! ... My deal was that, we've got to treat them rough. They're a nuclear menace so we have to be very tough.\" NPR's Keith: Trump tweeted about this on Thursday. \"Caught RED HANDED - very disappointed that China is allowing oil to go into North Korea,\" Trump said. \"There will never be a friendly solution to the North Korea problem if this continues to happen!\" The tweet raised questions about where this information had originated and whether the president was tweeting about something he had learned in a classified briefing. As Trump explains here, his source was a report on Fox News. NAFTA renegotiation: \"If I don't make the right deal, I'll terminate NAFTA in two seconds. But we're doing pretty good. You know, it's easier to renegotiate it if we make it a fair deal because NAFTA was a terrible deal for us. We lost $71 billion a year with Mexico, can you believe it?\" NPR's Montanaro: In 2016, the overall U.S. trade deficit with Mexico was about $56 billion, not $71 billion. But, more important, this is not a zero-sum game. American exports to Mexico have increased sixfold since NAFTA went into effect. Goods exports are five times as high as they were in 1993 when NAFTA was signed, with more than $200 billion worth of American goods being sold in Mexico. In fact, Mexico is the second-largest goods export market for the United States \u2014 behind Canada. As NPR's Danielle Kurtzleben fact-checked during the 2016 campaign: \"NAFTA doesn't seem to have been catastrophic for the U.S. economy or for U.S. jobs. As we pointed out in our last Trump speech annotation, nonpartisan analyses have found only a small economic impact from NAFTA. The Congressional Research Service wrote in a 2015 report, 'NAFTA did not cause the huge job losses feared by the critics or the large economic gains predicted by supporters.' \" Trade with Canada: \"[We lost] $17 billion with Canada \u2014 Canada says we broke even. But they don't include lumber and they don't include oil. Oh, that's not. ... [Inaudible,] ... My friend Justin [Trudeau, the Canadian prime minister] he says, 'No, no, we break even.' I said, 'Yeah, but you're not including oil, and you're not including lumber.' When you do, you lose $17 billion, and with the other one, we're losing $71 billion.\" NPR's Montanaro: The U.S. had a trade surplus with Canada of $12.5 billion in 2016. Canada is the U.S.'s largest export market, and the Commerce Department says exports to Canada accounted for an estimated 1.6 million jobs in the United States in 2015. Endorsing Strange, then Moore: \"I was for Strange, and I brought Strange up 20 points. Just so you understand. When I endorsed him, he was in fifth place. He went way up. Almost 20 points. But he fell a little short. But I knew what I was doing. Because I thought that. ... If you look at my rhetoric, I said the problem with Roy Moore is that he will lose the election. I called it. But as the head of the party, I have a choice: Do I endorse him or not? I don't know. ... I feel that I have to endorse Republicans as the head of the party. So, I endorsed him. ... The problem with Roy Moore, and I said this, is that he's going to lose the election. I hope you can straighten that out.\" NPR's Jessica Taylor: When Trump endorsed Sen. Luther Strange in a tweet on Aug. 8, most polls had Strange in second place behind Roy Moore in the GOP primary. One contemporaneous poll put the appointed senator's support at 23 percent, while another pegged it at 32 percent. Strange ended up getting just shy of 33 percent, compared with Moore's almost 39 percent in the first round of voting on Aug. 15. So Trump did not \"bring [Strange] up 20 points,\" and Strange was not in fifth place at any point in time. In the runoff in September, Strange did get 45 percent of the vote, an uptick of 20 points, but he was always going to gain more votes once there were just two candidates instead of a crowded field. That can't be attributed to Trump's endorsement alone \u2014 which wasn't able to bring Strange across the finish line. Moore headed to the general election instead. Trump did say at a rally on Strange's behalf on Sept. 22 that Strange was the most electable candidate, telling the crowd that, \"If [Luther] wins, that race is over. If somebody else wins, I will tell you, that's gonna be a very tough race.\" And those comments came before the sexual assault allegations against Moore surfaced. But Trump also did express some hesitation at endorsing Strange during that rally, admitting that, \"I'll be honest, I might have made a mistake\" in picking Strange. Many of Trump's allies \u2014 including former chief strategist Steve Bannon \u2014 backed Moore in the primary. Ultimately, Trump is probably right about another thing \u2014 if it had been Strange as the GOP nominee, Republicans very likely would have held on to the Alabama seat. Democrat Doug Jones won, despite a last-minute challenge from Moore and his refusal to concede even as the voting result was certified. The popular vote: \"I won because I was a better candidate by a lot. I won because I campaigned properly and she didn't. She campaigned for the popular vote. I campaigned for the Electoral College. ... It would have been a whole different thing. The genius is that the popular vote is a much different form of campaigning. Hillary never understood that.\" NPR's Keith: Hillary Clinton's campaign was not ignoring the Electoral College in favor of the popular vote, though it did assume she had more strength in several typically Democratic states than it turns out she did. In the lead-up to the election, Clinton's campaign focused on Florida, North Carolina and Ohio, states that were thought to be winnable but by no means a shoo-in, while spending less time and resources on Wisconsin and Michigan \u2014 traditionally Democratic states mistakenly thought to be in her column. Meanwhile, Trump put a lot of emphasis on those states, knowing he would need them to pull off an Electoral College victory, which he ultimately did. He also did so because it was his only path. Clinton had several options. The irony here is that some Clinton insiders were concerned that she would win the Electoral College but Trump would win the popular vote and then contest the election results. In the end, Clinton ended up with nearly 2.9 million more popular votes than Trump. For a primer on how the Electoral College works, watch this episode of Ron's Office Hours from February. Winning in 2020: \"We're going to win another four years for a lot of reasons, most importantly because our country is starting to do well again and we're being respected again. But another reason that I'm going to win another four years is because newspapers, television, all forms of media will tank if I'm not there because without me, their ratings are going down the tubes. Without me, The New York Times will indeed be not the failing New York Times, but the failed New York Times. So they basically have to let me win. And eventually, probably six months before the election, they'll be loving me because they're saying, 'Please, please, don't lose Donald Trump.' O.K.\" NPR's Keith: This is far from the first time Trump has claimed with confidence that he will win re-election in 2020. But he is now offering a stunning theory that the media \u2014 an institution he has denigrated to no end throughout 2017 \u2014 will help him win because papers and cable networks need him to keep their ratings and subscriptions up. It is true that Trump has generally been good for ratings. But in America, the media don't decide who wins elections. Voters do.",

Updated Monday, Oct. 23 at 6:08 p.m. ET When backed into a corner, President Trump digs in and fights back. It's what he's done as president, it's what he did as a candidate and it's what he did as a businessman. Just go listen to NPR's Embedded podcast and a recent episode about Trump's fight with Rancho Palos Verdes, Calif., over things as petty as a flagpole at his golf course, putting hedges in front of houses he thought were ugly and the name of a road. He wanted his name on it. He had been greeted as something of a conquering hero in that town. But the relationship soured after lawsuits and threats. So much so that the Republican town that voted for John McCain in 2008 and Mitt Romney in 2012 went for Hillary Clinton in 2016. \"I think the president has a bad habit when he's asked a question that he is uncomfortable with or can't quite come up with the right answer \u2014 he usually tries to reach out for scapegoats,\" Leon Panetta, former defense secretary under President Obama and chief of staff to Bill Clinton, told NPR's All Things Considered, \"and the first scapegoat this president seems to always turn to is President Obama. \"And when he talked about him not making calls that was a terrible mistake. And what bothers me is that it detracts from the main focus here, and the main focus has to be on the brave and courageous individuals that are willing to go out there and fight and die for America, and their families. There is some comfort here for all of this dispute, that maybe America again will take the time to remember that there are young men and women in uniform that are fighting and dying for this country. That's something sometimes we tend to forget.\" Part of the problem for Americans is the disconnect Panetta highlights between the military and the rest of society. In 1945, just before the end of World War II, there were 12 million active servicemembers. Now, there are just over a million or so. \"They're the best 1 percent this country produces,\" White House Chief of Staff John Kelly said Thursday in his defense of President Trump in the White House briefing room. It's actually less than 1 percent. That number in 1945 represented roughly 9 percent of the country's total population. Now, the number of active-duty servicemembers is only about 0.4 percent of the population. \"Most of you, as Americans, don't know them,\" Kelly continued. \"Many of you don't know anyone that knows any one of them.\" Americans are far less engaged in the debate over worldwide American missions than they likely would be if they had a daughter or son or neighbor in the fight. That has to have an effect on American society and policymaking. Trump highlighted that sacrifice at a Medal of Honor ceremony at the White House Monday. He honored retired Army Captain Gary M. Rose, who was a medic during Vietnam and saved a helicopter full of soldiers after it was shot down. But there are questions as to whether Trump can move on and keep his focus on where staff like Kelly would like it to be. Trump, for example, has shown no signs of wanting to move on from the fight with a Democratic congresswoman. Rep. Frederica Wilson of Florida revealed details of a conversation Trump had with a widow of one of the soldiers killed in Niger. I hope the Fake News Media keeps talking about Wacky Congresswoman Wilson in that she, as a representative, is killing the Democrat Party! People get what is going on! https://t.co/Pdg7VqQv6M And Trump's Twitter fingers were tested again Monday morning after Myeshia Johnson, the widow of Army Sgt. La David Johnson, who was one of the four killed in Niger, spoke out. The president \"said that 'he knew what he signed up for, but it hurts anyways,'\" Johnson recounted on ABC's Good Morning America. \"It made me cry, because I was very angry at the tone of his voice and couldn't remember my husband's name.\" Trump then said he had her husband's name on a report in front of him, Johnson said, describing Trump as \"stumbling on my husband's name. That's what hurt me most. He's out there fighting for our country, why can't you remember his name? ... He was an awesome soldier.\" She described herself as \"very, very upset and hurt. It made me cry even worse.\" Trump wasted no time defending his handling of the call and his use of Sgt. Johnson's name, tweeting shortly after the interview: I had a very respectful conversation with the widow of Sgt. La David Johnson, and spoke his name from beginning, without hesitation! Johnson's funeral was Saturday. The interview and Trump's response threaten to extend the controversy \u2014 which has been uncomfortable to see laid bare \u2014 for another week. Trump can't seem to let it go, even as the controversy descended into one about race \u2014 again during this presidency \u2014 by the end of last week. Here was the way Midwin Charles, writing for Essence magazine, framed it Friday, for example: \"At a time when Black women bury their sons and daughters as a result of gun violence, police brutality and service to this country, the lack of respect from this president is unbearable. Worse, he sets a dangerous precedent on how Black women should be perceived and treated in America.\" Trump has the opportunity to refocus this week, as Panetta suggests is necessary, on other subjects important to him and the country \u2014 like the budget and a tax overhaul with a trip to Capitol Hill the president has set for Tuesday. There's also the opioid epidemic; he's said he'll formally designate it a national emergency this week, although much remains unclear about the details of what that will mean. NPR's Susan Davis, congressional correspondent, writes: President Trump heads to Capitol Hill Tuesday to meet with Senate Republicans at their private weekly lunch. It is the first time Trump will attend the weekly lunch as president. Republicans are expected to plan out their fall agenda, with only seven legislative weeks remaining and a to-list that is growing. Republicans are sensitive to the fact that they haven't delivered much in the way of legislative victories in the first year of full GOP control of Washington. While the president has foisted on to lawmakers a number of unanticipated items, like immigration legislation affecting so-called DREAMers and tougher sanctions on Iran, there is nothing more important to the GOP agenda than passing tax legislation before the end of the year. Republicans largely believe that enacting sweeping tax cuts for American businesses and families will inoculate the party from a feared backlash in the 2018 midterm elections over the party's failures to make good on its promise to dismantle the Affordable Care Act. NPR's Tamara Keith, White House correspondent, who has covered the opioid crisis extensively, notes: President Trump says this week he will declare the opioid epidemic a national emergency. If he actually does it, Trump will be following through on a pledge he made more than two months ago. On Aug. 10, the president said, \"This is a national emergency, and we are drawing documents now.\" But there has been little sign since that the administration really was drawing up the documents. According to the latest numbers, nearly 150 Americans are dying each day from drug overdoses, the majority of those from heroin, fentanyl and other opioids. \"My guess is, we're going to see deaths go up than go down. I think we're on the wrong side of curve here,\" New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie recently said. He's chairman of President Trump's opioid commission, which is set to release a final set of recommendations Nov. 1. But, it is such a significant crisis that on July 31 the commission issued an interim report with a recommendation it described as urgent: that the president declare a national emergency, to free up resources and bring increased attention to something that every three weeks is killing as many people as died on Sept. 11. \"Your declaration would empower your cabinet to take bold steps and would force Congress to focus on funding and empowering the Executive Branch even further to deal with this loss of life,\" the commission report noted. \"You, Mr. President, are the only person who can bring this type of intensity to the emergency and we believe you have the will to do so and to do so immediately.\" Tackling the opioid crisis was a key Trump campaign promise. The question this week is whether he will follow through with action.",

When President Trump announced a ban on travel for citizens from several predominantly Muslim countries in January, a coalition of officials from various blue states quickly rallied to fight it. \"We just started talking to each other Friday afternoon,\" recalls New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman. \"By Sunday morning, we had 17 states signed on to say, 'This is unconstitutional. We're going into court to stop it.' And we went into courts all over the country and eventually got it struck down.\" Throughout U.S. history, states have traditionally acted as counterweights to presidential authority, challenging the way laws are enforced. It was the states, for example, that waged some of the earliest and most effective legal battles against the Affordable Care Act. And as the investigation into Russian interference in last year's election heats up, the states could once again play a powerful adversarial role, especially if the White House takes steps to thwart the probe. If there is a prosecution by a state, whether it's New York or any other state, the president of the United States and his pardon power does not prevail. Former New York Attorney General Robert Abrams If federal officials decide not to pursue charges \u2014 or are blocked from doing so \u2014 states conceivably could step in to fill the breach by filing charges of their own. \"There's no question that legally they can, if they have the ability to charge; in other words, if Trump or any of his associates have committed a crime in a particular state,\" says Jennifer Rodgers, executive director of the Center for the Advancement of Public Integrity at Columbia University Law School. As Trump's home state, New York has a potentially important role to play, says Rodgers, who previously worked at the U.S. Attorney's Office. \"If you're talking about New York state, I think the likelihood is pretty good that if a federal crime was committed here that a state crime will also have been committed, because the campaign was based here. So probably lots of their meetings and phone calls and other actions like that will have occurred here,\" Rodgers says. \"So then you're just looking at whether state law provides an avenue to charge whatever it is that the feds would be charging.\" Importantly, while the president can pardon people accused of federal crimes, he has no such power at the state level. \"If there is a prosecution by a state, whether it's New York or any other state, the president of the United States and his pardon power does not prevail,\" says former New York Attorney General Robert Abrams. New York also has the power to shut down corporations headquartered in the state, including the Trump Organization, if they are found guilty of crimes, although such a move would be a legally drastic one. \"The attorney general in New York is a very key player with very strong powers, particularly as it relates to corporate action and corporate entities, and can do an awful lot in terms of taking action to investigate, to prosecute, to penalize and even seeking to dissolve,\" Abrams says. Schneiderman already has something of a history with Trump, having launched fraud charges against Trump University, a real estate seminar accused of fraud by some of its customers. Trump settled the case for $25 million shortly after his election last November, after long insisting he wouldn't do so. \"I do have more experience with the president than others, because I was in litigation with him for years over Trump University,\" Schneiderman says. \"I didn't think this particular skill set would be so important, but it turned out, as of January, it was.\" New York officials are already playing a part in the Russia investigation and have reportedly helped federal officials looking into money-laundering allegations against former Trump campaign manager Paul Manafort. But Schneiderman says there has been a joint effort by a number of mostly blue states to block some of Trump's more controversial initiatives, in the areas of immigration, voting rights and the environment. Some 15 states, including New York, Washington, North Carolina and Iowa, banded together earlier this month to file a lawsuit blocking the White House from terminating the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, which allowed some immigrants brought to the country illegally as children to stay in the United States. The states are working together in a way that is much less ad hoc and more formalized than it used to be. \"There are regular conference calls. Staffs are talking to each other all the time. We're dividing up work. And there's much more of an attitude of, 'Look, we're all in this together,' \" Schneiderman says.",

Luther Strange, R-Ala., campaigns at McCoy Outdoors in Mobile last weekend. The Republican Party's infighting is on full display in Alabama ahead of next week's Senate runoff \u2014 a race that's getting nastier by the day. Conservative insurgents, including President Trump's former chief strategist, Steve Bannon, have aligned themselves behind controversial former state Supreme Court Chief Justice Roy Moore. Meanwhile, the GOP establishment \u2014 bolstered this time by Trump himself in a surprising move \u2014 is working overtime to make sure that appointed Sen. Luther Strange triumphs to finish the term of Attorney General Jeff Sessions, who represented Alabama in the Senate for two decades. Trump will headline a rally for Strange on Friday night, which the senator's D.C. backers are hopeful will help push him over the finish line come Sept. 26. But Moore has his own heavy hitters coming to help him Thursday \u2014 former GOP vice presidential nominee Sarah Palin and former Trump adviser Sebastian Gorka. Both candidates argue they are best equipped to \"drain the swamp\" in Washington. Moore \u2014 who finished first in last month's primary \u2014 is leading in most polls and has seized on the fact that Strange is bolstered by allies of Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell. The Senate Leadership Fund, a superPAC aligned with McConnell, has spent almost $9 million in the race, hammering Moore while trying to boost Strange. \"Drain the swamp. Send McConnell a message. Send them all a message,\" says one Moore ad, which decries McConnell's \"D.C. slime machine\" for its heavy rotation of hits. \"The people of Alabama know what's happening in Washington and they won't stand for it,\" Moore said at a campaign rally in Huntsville, Ala., last weekend. \"They won't stand for their vote to be bought and paid for.\" Moore benefits in the GOP primary race from a long, albeit contentious, history in state politics. He was twice removed as chief justice of Alabama's top state court for defying the federal courts \u2014 first in 2003 for displaying a giant Ten Commandments monument at the state judicial building. He was eventually re-elected but then suspended again, in 2016, for rejecting the U.S. Supreme Court's ruling legalizing same-sex marriage across the country. It's that history that worries national Republicans, who fear he would be a loose cannon if he gets the nomination and could even put what should be a very safe seat in jeopardy. That anxiety became even more real for them this week when Moore was caught on tape lamenting divisions in the country by using widely recognized racial slurs. \"We have blacks and whites fighting, reds and yellows fighting, Democrats and Republicans fighting, men and women fighting,\" Moore said. His campaign said he was simply referring to the Christian song \"Jesus Loves the Little Children.\" Moore's campaign leans heavily on the religious conservative message that has fueled his rise in the state. \"It's about the elimination of the acknowledgment of God in our society,\" Moore said at the campaign rally, warning that \"without that God we have no rights.\" Strange, the former Alabama state attorney general, was appointed earlier this year under less than auspicious circumstances. He was investigating then-Gov. Robert Bentley's misuse of his office to cover up an extramarital affair. Bentley eventually resigned. But since heading to Washington, he has become a staunch Trump ally and was rewarded with an endorsement by the president \u2014 who remains extremely popular in Alabama, especially among the type of conservative, would-be Moore voters that Strange needs. With most public polls showing Strange still trailing Moore, Friday's rally with Trump could be his last best hope to get the momentum on his side. \"I'm fighting every day to pass Trump's agenda,\" Strange says in one recent ad. Back home in Alabama last Saturday, Strange visited with fans at a college football game and stopped by McCoy Outdoors, a sporting goods shop in Mobile. At the gun counter, he tested which models fit his grip (nicknamed \"Big Luther,\" Strange is 6 feet, 9 inches) and touted his endorsement from the National Rifle Association. He argues to voters that he is the real Trump candidate. \"You can put Mitch McConnell aside. You can make him a symbol all you want,\" Strange said. \"The real relevant fact here in Alabama is that President Trump supports me.\" For Gene Daniels, who was in the store to sell a gun, that was good enough. \"Since Trump likes him, I kinda like him too,\" said Daniels. Others say they don't think Roy Moore is qualified. He has been criticized for not having a deep understanding of policy matters. Earlier this month, after Trump announced his decision to wind down President Obama's Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program for so-called DREAMers, Moore didn't know what the program was. \"Roy Moore more cannot help us in Alabama. He'll help Roy Moore. And he'd have fun running around and doing what he's always done, being someone that's an outsider \u2014 you know, playing to himself. But that's not what we need in Alabama,\" said Richard Murray, a GOP voter from Mobile.

The race is also an early key test for Bannon \u2014 now back with Breitbart News, which has been promoting Moore \u2014 and his anti-establishment allies to see whether they can take on McConnell ahead of key 2018 primaries. But GOP strategists worry such a move could produce weaker general election nominees and leave them vulnerable come next year, when a friendly GOP map should mean they make gains in the Senate. This time, Trump is siding with McConnell's chosen candidate, despite a rocky relationship with the Senate Republican leader. A loss by Strange would be a blow to McConnell. And if Moore does win the general election in December, that would give McConnell a rabble-rousing senator that could make it harder to corral Senate Republicans. By wading into the race beyond just supportive tweets, Trump now ups the stakes for himself too, and a loss by his chosen candidate may mean he won't be as willing next time to go against much of his core base and vocal supporters who have lined up behind Moore. However, Democrat Doug Jones, who has already won his party's Senate nomination, is counting on such internecine wars to help him pull off an upset. Jones is former U.S. attorney from Birmingham, best-known for prosecuting Ku Klux Klan church bombers. \"The Republican Party today in Alabama is very similar to the Democratic Party of old,\" Jones told NPR. \"It's just a conglomeration of factions that don't like each other. And so I think there's going to be an opportunity in a special election.\" That still remains a long shot, though, since Democrats have not won a statewide office in Alabama since 2008.",

President Trump continues to learn things about his job and the rest of us continue to learn things about Donald Trump. Last week, faced with one natural disaster festering in Texas and another impending in Florida, Trump used a storm relief bill to save Congress from a fiscal disaster of its own making. Moreover, he did it by shunning his own party's leaders in the House and Senate and cutting a deal instead with the leaders of the opposition. So it was that the president ended the week basking in appreciation across a broad swath of the media spectrum \u2014 a fact he noted with satisfaction in a follow-up conversation with Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y. \"He said, do you watch Fox News? I said, not really,\" Schumer reported. \"He said, they're praising you. And your stations \u2014 meaning I guess MSNBC, CNN \u2014 are praising me. This is great.\" No one doubts that the president would prefer to be celebrated on the cable programs he reportedly watches obsessively, including CNN and MSNBC. Despite his claim that \"any negative polls are fake news,\" he cannot have enjoyed watching his approval rating slide into the 30s in the preponderance of national polls. He knows as well as anyone that in politics, as in entertainment, perception of popularity is as important as popularity itself. What we do not know is how these latest moves will play with Trump's most loyal fans, the people who voted for him last November and who have never stopped telling pollsters they approve of him. Will it strain their loyalty to see their champion suddenly making nice with the likes of Schumer and House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif.? Were they surprised to hear Trump refer to \"Chuck and Nancy\" as though they were all old pals? Among hardcore conservatives, those two names are about as popular as Harvey and Irma are around the Gulf Coast right now. For years, Republican campaigners have cast Pelosi as the Wicked Witch of the West, a surefire goad to donors and voters alike. So how will this work for the people who go to rallies and chant \"Drain the swamp!\" and \"Lock her up!\" and cheer wildly for their president? We saw these events in 2015 and 2016, and we have seen them again this year in Iowa, Ohio, Pennsylvania and Arizona. In Phoenix, Trump got a roar from his boisterous crowd when he vowed to get the money for his wall on the U.S.-Mexico border or \"close down our government.\" But here we are in September and we see Trump in cahoots with Democrats. And they are not only working to keep the government open but also talking about eliminating the debt limit permanently. And not only did the September deal with Democrats omit any money for the wall, but a day earlier the president had professed the \"great love\" in his heart for the DREAMers, the people in the country illegally who were brought here as minors. Wait, now. These DREAMers are the beneficiaries of DACA (Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals), a signature program created by executive action by former President Obama. Less than a week ago, Trump had sent his attorney general out to declare DACA illegal, unconstitutional and bound for oblivion. He gave Congress six months to act. And now we hear the White House actually wants Congress to act on DREAMers' behalf? And, according to another tweet, the president will otherwise \"revisit\" the issue? Congress now has 6 months to legalize DACA (something the Obama Administration was unable to do). If they can't, I will revisit this issue! The contradiction on DACA, even more than on the fiscal agenda, would seem to pressure the Trump coalition to a dangerous degree. Is there not a point where the hardcore is puzzled? Or cries out in pain? It's too early to say, but early indications suggest the base will hold firm \u2014 at least for now. One big reason is that the people most upset about Trump's recent overtures to Democratic leaders in Congress are the Republican leaders in Congress \u2014 and the latter are themselves unpopular with Trump's supporters. Those Republican leaders are pinned down right now by crossfire from multiple directions. Speaker Paul Ryan, of Wisconsin, and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, of Kentucky, are criticized by their Democratic counterparts in Congress, of course. But the heavier fire comes in from conservative media, bloggers and talk show hosts, some of whom are beginning to demand that the two GOP leaders be replaced. \"Trump voters are clearly disgusted by the failure of Congressional GOP leadership to keep their promises,\" said Rick Manning, president of Americans for Limited Government, talking to Breitbart News. \"For those in D.C. who are politically deluding themselves, it is clear that the way forward is by standing on the president's shoulders, not by cutting him off at the knees.\" In truth, Ryan and McConnell were the ones felled by that White House meeting with the president, the Democrats and Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin. Yet this was only their most recent humiliation at the hands (or tweeting thumbs) of the president, who clearly uses them as a foils. President Donald Trump and Vice President Mike Pence meet with: (clockwise from lower left) House Majority Leader Rep. Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif.; Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin; Speaker of the House Paul Ryan, R-Wisc.; Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky.; Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y.; and House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., in the Oval Office on Wednesday.\n                \n                    \n                    Alex Wong/Getty Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption President Donald Trump and Vice President Mike Pence meet with: (clockwise from lower left) House Majority Leader Rep. Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif.; Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin; Speaker of the House Paul Ryan, R-Wisc.; Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky.; Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y.; and House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., in the Oval Office on Wednesday. Trump has not forgotten Ryan's withdrawal of an invitation to campaign together in Wisconsin after the Access Hollywood tape last October. Nor has he forgiven McConnell for the Senate's failure on the repeal of the Affordable Care Act. The war between Trump and these GOP chieftains has been a one-sided affair. Even after the latest blowup, Ryan and McConnell toed the line and excused the boss for doing what he did. It was, they said, a moment of national emergency. They had little choice. Whatever they know about what will come next, and about the price Schumer and Pelosi will exact, they cannot denounce the president. Again, the reason is the strength of his tie to his backers. Hardcore Trump supporters may account for less than 40% of the national electorate.  The latest Gallup Poll shows only 38% approve of his job performance.  But the same soundings find that among Republicans, Trump's approval remains above 70%. Dominating opinion within one party is not enough to elect or re-elect a president, perhaps, but it's more than enough to win GOP primaries.  That is why every Republican seeking to replace Jeff Sessions in the Senate wanted Trump's endorsement  in this summer's GOP primaries (where a runoff is now slated for Sept. 26). Why does Trump's brand remain strong among Republicans? A lively debate has sprung up over this question. In the weeks and months right after the election, voters who had shifted from Obama to Trump were often characterized as disaffected middle-class Americans who had lost their purchase on the American dream. They were victims of automation and immigration, left behind in the heartland by high-tech industries concentrated on the coasts. Their communities had been ravaged by opioid addiction and high rates of alcohol abuse, depression and suicide. But compelling as these arguments remain, they do not tell the whole story. Trump's voters may be dislocated by economic changes, but they are disturbed by social and cultural changes as well. A recent survey by NBC News asked how comfortable Americans were with changes in the society and the culture. A little over half (55%) were basically comfortable. That sentiment was shared by less than half of seniors (48%), those living in rural areas (38%), Republicans (30%) and conservatives (33%). The least comfortable of all (28%) were the Trump voters. This group is composed primarily of Republicans, but also includes some independents and not a few \"legacy\" Democrats. It is entirely possible that this mix will react to Trump's latest gambits quite positively, seeing an opening to Schumer and Pelosi as potentially productive. In his Inaugural Address, Trump described his truest supporters as \"the forgotten men and women of our country\" That is far from being a new theme in American politics. Richard Nixon used a similar phrase in some of his campaigns nearly half a century ago. With Nixon, as with Trump, it spoke to a wide range of concerns \u2014 economic, to be sure, but also social and cultural. Nixon found this enabled him to govern without a fixed, ideological playbook \u2014 pleasing his own party most of the time but acceding to the creation of the EPA and various other new regulatory agencies as well. He signed the bill mandating athletic programs for women in college. He put in place wage and price controls. He went to China. The Nixon model was urged on Trump at the outset of his presidency. In the early going, he chose to work almost exclusively with the party that had nominated and elected him. But he had signaled, even in his Inauguration Day address, that he might go his own way. He may be testing that option now, keeping a weather eye on the reaction from his truest believers.",

On the same night that torch-bearing white nationalists wound up staging a rally at the University of Virginia in Charlottesville, Van Jones stood at a podium, in the nation's capital, telling a theater full of supporters why they should let love rule in the face of racial hatred. The timing was sheer coincidence \u2014 the ninth stop on the CNN pundit's 14-city WE RISE tour had been scheduled well ahead of Friday night's prelude to the violent Unite the Right protest \u2014 but one that speaks to the reason why Jones' #LoveArmy crusade has been met with criticism from the very circles he's hoping to corral. \"A lot of people are asking, 'Why are you doing this?' \" Jones said Friday from the stage of D.C.'s Warner Theatre. \"I am sick of you guys being stressed and depressed since this past election.\" Deemed \"a star of the 2016 campaign\" by the New York Times shortly after blaming \"whitelash\" for President Trump's election, Jones quickly earned the liberal left's ire after characterizing Trump's State of the Union address as \"presidential.\" Since signing with JAY-Z's Roc Nation management firm earlier this year, however, he's earning cred among a different constituency: generation hip-hop. The first political activist on an artist roster ranging from Big Sean to DJ Khaled and Damian Marley to Rihanna, Jones recently got stopped in the airport by a young TSA agent who said she recognized him, not from the cable news network, he tells me, but for appearing in Footnotes for 4:44, the Tidal-exclusive short doc series complementing JAY-Z's latest album. Despite his critics, Van Jones still attracts plenty of fans at tour stops like the one in Los Angeles.\n                \n                    \n                    Jerritt Clark/Getty Images for Roc Nation\n                    \n                \nhide caption Despite his critics, Van Jones still attracts plenty of fans at tour stops like the one in Los Angeles. \"JAY-Z's platform is bigger than CNN's platform for this new generation coming up,\" Jones says by phone. Though he admits his own hip-hop bona fides are less up-to-date \u2014 \"I mean, I know Chance the Rapper,\" he adds \u2014 Jones is using his Roc Nation affiliation to fuse a tighter relationship between artists and activists. During his Atlanta stop, he talked to T.I. about the criminalization that leads to mass incarceration among young black men in the hood. Roc Nation artist Rapsody opened Friday night's show in Washington with a performance before Jones brought out former NAACP president and Maryland gubernatorial candidate Ben Jealous for a conversation. But this isn't some Van Jones-come-lately hip-hop hookup. He's been rallying rap activists since the mid-'90s, when he was a young dreadlocked attorney who got an officer kicked off the San Francisco Police Department following his implication in the death of an unarmed black suspect. With his Dream Corps nonprofit using the same coalition-building tactics to tackle a range of initiatives, Jones' #LoveArmy-powered tour might seem like the perfect setup for a potential candidate who once worked in Obama's White House, before he was forced to resign as a \"green jobs czar\" following criticism over controversial comments made about Republicans prior to his appointment. But it only takes a candid half-hour conversation with him \u2014 which we had a few days before the tragic events in Charlottesville and one week before Jones' tearful on-air response to President Trump's latest remarks, blaming \"both sides\" for the weekend's violence \u2014 to realize Jones is probably too passionate and point-blank for public office. He invoked the names of Civil Rights heroes ranging from Martin Luther King to Ella Baker as we discussed his frustrations with cynicism masked as activism, black America's moral obligation and critics who see his message of love as a hard sell in the era of Trump. This interview was edited for clarity and length. Rodney Carmichael: How did you wind up signing with Roc Nation? Did it start from a personal relationship with JAY-Z? Van Jones: It was really through Prince. I worked with Prince for years and he was working with JAY-Z, trying to support Tidal. When he passed, that relationship was still intact. And they said, 'Look, we're doing athletes, we're doing artists, but we have never really dealt with people in the television world, the pundit world.' Hip-hop artists often find themselves being courted as pawns in politics. How have you convinced some of the entertainers and rappers participating in the tour that this isn't more of the same old BS? Well, it's hard to get out of the political system what we need. But I'm not a politician and I'm not running for office. I've been working on grassroots issues since 1993, when I got out of law school. So all the ticket proceeds go to help the Dream Corps, a support center that really backs up #YesWeCode, teaching our young people how to program computers; Green For All, which is working to get solar jobs and solar opportunities to the hood. We have a criminal justice program, [#cut50]. So they can look at the track record of what we've been doing on issues that they want to be supportive of. Once you start getting into the electoral situation, I think it's a lot more dicey because it's hard for us to get the political system to be responsive. But I think artists have always felt more comfortable addressing issues like criminal justice, like addiction, like jobs, which is what we're really doing with this tour. Van Jones engages with rap artists like Atlanta's T.I. on each stop of the activist's WE RISE tour.\n                \n                    \n                    Roc Nation\n                    \n                \nhide caption Van Jones engages with rap artists like Atlanta's T.I. on each stop of the activist's WE RISE tour. Usually, politicians only come around to engage the community when they want to push us to the polls. I know you're not running for office, but why pick an off year in the election cycle for the tour? Well, because poverty doesn't take a year off, and addiction doesn't take a year off, and violence doesn't take a year off, police brutality doesn't take a year off. I think that is a big part of the problem, that people show up every four years or two years. But the problems and the problem solvers are always here. You've got a president that's more interested in having people turn on each other than turn to each other and that's a big part of the problem. But we don't have to go for that. There are poor white people all over the country now who have addiction and poverty and criminal records and are living in neighborhoods with high death rates \u2014 in places like West Virginia, Appalachia \u2014 and nobody's doing anything for them, either. I'm looking around like, why are we fighting each other? We've got the same problems. Common pain should lead to common purpose. And common purpose should lead to common protests. Common protests should lead to some kind of common sense. And that's really what the tour's about. I got to watch your web series The Messy Truth around election time. It was a hard watch. And it's funny because, after the election, a large part of the media narrative began to echo the idea that we need to be listening to Middle America more. But in a way it started to sound like we were saying we need to give a bigger stage to some of this bigotry and backwardness. What did you want people to gain from watching that series? I think hurt people holler. When you have Black Lives Matter and the Dreamers and Occupy Wall Street and Bernie Sanders supporters marching and jumping up and down, it's because they're hurt. And people need to pay more attention to what folks are saying. Young African-Americans aren't marching around here talking about Black Lives Matter for no reason. At the same time, when you see the Tea Party and then the Trump people jumping up and down and hollering, we need to pay attention. Some of the stuff they're saying is completely unacceptable. Some of the ideas they have, I've been opposed to my whole life \u2014 and not just on Twitter, in real life. But some of the stuff they're saying, I agree with. When they say the people in Washington D.C. don't care about us, and we're not finding a way to have good jobs or a level of comfort and security, they're not wrong. That's true. [Washington politicians aren't] worried about my people, either. It's not just all one thing. If you deal with the black community, on the one hand we're oppressed and a righteous community. On the other hand, we have a lot of issues internally that we don't want Fox News pointing out. But they are real issues. I call it The Messy Truth for a reason. I'm trying to give everybody permission to look at it in a more complicated way. People say, 'Oh Van, when you go out there and talk to those Trump people, does it change any of their minds?' That's not my job. I'm not trying to convince Trump people to be better people. I'm trying to prevent the Trump era from making me a worse person. I do not want to become somebody who is so hard-hearted that I can only see the worst in my opponent. Dr. King said you should never let a man drive you so low as to hate him. I'm in a weird situation where I thought we were civil rights people, human rights people, progressive people, transformative people. That's what I thought we were. Why am I going to let a bad leader in the White House have us then create a bad movement that would be unrecognizable to Dr. King and Ella Jo Baker and Fannie Lou Hamer. They had way more hateful people coming at them than these fools tweeting at us. And they didn't come with some middle finger. So I just don't understand it.

Why does it seem like the emotional labor of fighting inequality always falls on the backs of black folks and other marginalized people in this country? We get hit with the whole forgiveness narrative and told we need to be the bigger, more morally-grounded people. But what political gains have black people retained from loving our enemy? First of all, if we're not gonna be moral, then who is? I hope you're not expecting for Paul Ryan or Fox News to be the moral leaders of the country. Cause you're gonna be waiting a long time for that. I keep hearing this [and] it's become very fashionable to say, but it has no relationship to history and it has no relationship to strategy. It's just an emotional kind of fatigue, which I understand. But when you're fatigued you need to sit down, drink a Gatorade and get back in the fight. Fatigue is not a strategy. It's not fair that the oppressed have to lead the oppressors to their freedom, but it's necessary. It's the only time it's ever worked. If Frederick Douglass can come out of slavery, if Harriet Tubman can come out of slavery, and fight to move the country to higher ground and succeed, we can't deal with some tweets? It's become fashionable to be cynical and say a bunch of s--- that has nothing to do with history and strategy. So what's the strategy? Is the strategy then for us to say, 'We're gonna return hatred for hatred?' Is that our strategy? And if that's the strategy, then how does that actually work? But isn't the love/hate binary a false one? For so long we've always heard black people are too emotional to really know how to play the political game. Where is the room for critical thinking if the choice is only between love or hate? It almost feels like blind love is as bad as hate when it comes to political discourse, right? I think you're asking a very important set of questions, so let me try to give maybe a more useful set of answers. The question maybe should be [about] the definition of love. Dr. King loved his enemies. He also crippled their economy with boycotts. He also shamed and humiliated the whole country by forcing them to show their hand. He twisted the arm of presidents and got laws passed. So the idea that we just sit up here and love and there's no political game \u2014 there's a whole bunch of stuff you can say that we actually did get. [We got] the Voting Rights Act. Now, are they taking them away? Yes. But my frustration is it's just become fashionable to be cynical and not actually look at history. [The movement] was a two-prong thing in the '60s: On the one hand you would have straight-up riots and all kinds of other stuff, and that would have an impact. But you'd also have the other side of it, which was a little bit more targeted and strategic. Nobody was just sitting down. People act like you're going to sit down and sing \"Kumbaya.\" These younger people don't study the strategy of non-violence. It's not either fight or don't fight. Of course we're gonna fight. If you're not gonna fight in the face of all this stuff, then I don't have anything to say to you. The question is who are you gonna be when you fight? What's the strategy? And then, what's the outcome? Frankly, a lot of this cynicism is just dressed-up surrender. [If] all you basically want to be able to do is sit up here and complain about racism and have your pity-party, that's not a strategy. People are like, 'Oh f--- Van Jones. He's up there talking to these white people and this love shit. He's selling out.' Wait a second. If I'm selling out, who's buying it? Because I don't see the Trump people moving and I don't see us moving, either. So there's not a whole lot of upside. It'd be a lot easier for me to just be out here saying, 'I hate all these people and I hate Trump!' That's an easier sell and there's a bigger market for that. But I'm actually looking at my history. You have to ask a question: If black people who are the saving grace for this country \u2014 we have always been the most moral force, we've opposed every war, we support every social program, we've been the leadership of every single movement \u2014 if we are now going to turn around ... and say we're done, we're turning in our card and we're no longer gonna fight for the highest values, well then who's going to do it? And then do you want to live in a world where nobody's doing it? That's the question I don't hear anybody asking. So I'm out here trying to have this conversation. Nick Cannon and Russell Simmons joined Van Jones onstage at the L.A. stop of his 14-city tour in July.\n                \n                    \n                    Jerritt Clark/Getty for Roc Nation\n                    \n                \nhide caption Nick Cannon and Russell Simmons joined Van Jones onstage at the L.A. stop of his 14-city tour in July. When you look at the Civil Rights era, a lot of that strategy worked because there was still a sense of shame in the nation around the truth and ugliness of racism and segregation. And once that stuff became public, that was the leverage to provoke a lot of change. Now it feels different. This era of social media and reality TV that has propelled our politics is all about being shamelessly public about who and what you are and owning your biases. So how does that strategy still have the same kind of impact in a country that feels so shameless? That's a great question and I don't have a simple, easy answer. I think that sometimes, though, an evil wizard can conduct a lot of magic tricks. So you're looking at one corner of society, and you do have a shameless person who is driving down the culture. But that doesn't mean that every single white person, for instance, is unmoved. You've always had people who didn't give a damn about us, who were absolutely hostile \u2014 people like [Attorney General Jeff] Sessions, people like Trump, people like [Civil Rights-era public safety commissioner of Birmingham] Bull Connor. And you also have people right now who are ashamed, but here's the difference: We don't know what to do with the white people who are ashamed because [we] continue to criticize them. Listen, everybody gets mad at me because I just tell the truth on all sides. I don't give a damn. I'm not running for office. I am trying to close prisons, pull needles out of folks' arms and get jobs \u2014 that's what the Dream Corps is about. So I have to look at everything fair. Trump is much worse than most people understand. But just because Trump is worse than some people know, that doesn't mean his supporters aren't better than people know. He does have some supporters out there who are potential allies on some key issues around government surveillance, around criminal justice, around addiction. If the black political culture continues to move in the direction it's moving in, where we stop being moral [leaders] and stop being strategic, I think we pay a bigger cost than our opponents for that. The terrible thing about racism is it's a no-win situation. That's the trap that we're in, [and it's the] same with politics. If we don't reach out and try to build some bridges, we get run over. If we do reach out and try to build some bridges, then we get taken advantage of. That's not the conclusion; that's the premise. And I've got all these young people running to me screaming about the premise like that's the conclusion. You just now noticed that we're in a trick bag? You just figured that out? That's just being black. Now what's your strategy? How frustrating has it been for you, after working in this space for so many years fighting for everything from criminal justice to environmental justice, to be dealing with so much criticism from your own folks \u2014 whether it be black folks like me who were kind of side-eyeing you over The Messy Truth or even liberals who went off the deep end after you called Trump 'presidential'? You know, it is frustrating, but I understand. Look, people want you just to be their sock puppet. I'm almost 50 years old; I'm not a child. I was born in '68. I've got people in their 20s criticizing me and I've been doing this work, literally, their entire lives. I started as a serious activist in '89. Got out of law school in '93 and you can ask anybody that knows me, I've very rarely taken more than two days off in a row in two-plus decades. I've closed five prisons. I've stopped them from building the super-jail for youth in Oakland; I stopped that. I've gotten a police officer fired. I've reformed two police departments. So all this stuff that people are talking about that needs to happen, I've done. And I'm gonna tell you, once you get through doing it you look around and realize this stuff is more complicated. There are very few fights I've won where it was only black progressives. Every fight I've won, it's been some weird coalition of like some crazy white Republican who's mad at this person, and some Latina grandmamas over here, and some business people and labor people. Whenever you actually put together something that works, it's always complicated. It's always messy when you're actually doing stuff that's real work, when you're actually getting bills passed, when you're actually getting prisons closed, when you're actually getting reforms done. It's never what the little Twitter crowd is talking about. So I've learned I can't let them run me. To the extent that people need somebody who's just going to be their teddy bear and say what they want to hear, there are plenty of people willing to do that. To the extent that people find me interesting, it's cause they don't know what the hell I'm gonna say. They're like, 'What's that fool talkin' bout?' \u2014 on both sides. And I'm willing to challenge people.",

There's a word that follows Chris Forsyth's music around and makes the Philadelphia guitarist uncomfortable. \"I have a complicated relationship with transcendence,\" he tells NPR. He understands why his guitar epics invite the comparison: Channeling Television, Pere Ubu and kosmische questers past, they race towards some receding target like a rocket aiming for Mars, or greyhounds hurtling hungrily towards a stuffed rabbit. \"But there's also an implication of escape embedded in the term that I've not really been feeling lately,\" he explains. \"I'm not living or working in a vacuum; I'm a part of the world and I want my work to engage with the people and forces in it, not escape from it. I realize my songs tend to go on for a long time by conventional standards, but I'm not really interested in having the music feel wandering or searching.\" Dreaming In The Non-Dream, Forsyth's forthcoming album with his Solar Motel Band, was conceived and recorded following the last U.S. election. He calls these songs \"a way of grappling with that event-slash-calamity,\" and took the title from a William Burroughs quote: \"America is not so much a nightmare as a non-dream. The American non-dream is precisely a move to wipe the dream out of existence. The dream is a spontaneous happening and therefore dangerous to a control system set up by the non-dreamers.\" \"I'm also reminded of this Don Van Vliet quote from 1980,\" says Forsyth. \"'I'm doing a non-hypnotic music to break up the catatonic state ... and I think there is one right now.' \" The near-16-minute-long title track, premiering here today, is on a much shorter leash than any of Forsyth's previous releases. It's concise and lean, almost speeding on an empty tank through a tireless groove that solders dusty Ohio punk to krautrock's soothing repetitions, dipping from warped boogie into jittery synths, pausing for a brief, mellow reprieve and then gasping towards an arid and exhilarating conclusion. It knows where it's going. \"To me, these songs are as tight and lyrical and punchy as a three-minute pop song, just a little more ... time-elastic,\" says Forsyth. Dreaming In The Non-Dream comes as a reaction to last year's The Rarity Of Experience, Forsyth's most involved recording project to date. The overdubs and edits are gone, and in their place is \"a more cinema v\u00e9rit\u00e9 process,\" recorded and mixed in four days and tracked live with all the musicians in the room and just a few overdubs. Prior to recording, he also downsized the band to guitar, bass (Peter Kerlin) and drums (Ray Kubian), making it his first album since 2013's Solar Motel (actually recorded in 2011) with no second guitarist. \"I wanted total control of the guitars on this,\" he says, crediting keyboardist Shawn E. Hansen as the record's second lead. Their anxieties fueled Dreaming In The Non-Dream, but kept it defiantly grounded, too. \"I think, again reflecting on what was in the air while working on this \u2014 Brexit and then Trump's election \u2014 I did not really have the patience or the desire, or the money, to do something painstaking,\" says Forsyth. \"I wanted to take that intensity that we were all feeling and put it on the record.\" Dreaming In The Non-Dream comes out Aug. 25 via No Quarter.",

Kennedy library on Sunday in Boston.\n                \n                    \n                    Getty Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption Former President Barack Obama speaks after receiving the 2017 John F. Kennedy Profile In Courage Award at the John F. Kennedy library on Sunday in Boston. Former President Barack Obama urged Republicans to be guided by a personal standard of ethics and integrity, not political avarice, as they forge ahead with plans to dismantle the Affordable Care Act \u2014 his signature legislation. Obama had refrained from weighing in on the bitter health care battle, but he broke his silence while accepting the Profile in Courage Award at the John F. Kennedy Presidential Library and Museum in Boston on Sunday night. \"I hope that current members of Congress recall that it actually doesn't take a lot of courage to aid those who are already powerful, already comfortable, already influential. But it does require some courage to champion the vulnerable and the sick and the infirm,\" Obama said. He also had these words of caution for members of the Senate, who will be taking up the repeal-and-replace plan next: \"I hope they understand that courage means not simply doing what is simply politically expedient, but doing what [people] believe in their hearts is right.\" Obama never mentioned President Trump by name, but he did say that despite valiant efforts by many leaders who had come before him, health care overhaul had failed because \"it was hard,\" adding that it is \"easily subject to misinformation and fearmongering.\" He commended the members of Congress who voted to push through the Affordable Care Act, which came to be known as Obamacare, in 2009 and 2010, saying they did so at great political peril to their own careers. Several lawmakers lost their seats in the following midterm elections. \"These men and women did the right thing. They did the hard thing. Theirs was a profile in courage,\" Obama said. Further reflecting on his first term, Obama recalled the brief period when Democrats and Republicans worked together to stave off a series of national crises. Amid the financial chaos that followed his inauguration, Obama said, the two sides enacted laws that kept the economy from free fall and saved the auto industry. In addition to the words of advice he doled out to elected officials, Obama also shared words of encouragement with the electorate at large. (After all, he's one of them now.) \"Everywhere we see the risk of falling into the refuge of tribe and clan and anger at those who don't look like us,\" he said, adding, \"At such moments, we need courage to stand up to hate.\" The Kennedy library bestowed the award upon Obama for securing health coverage for millions of Americans, a cause that was long championed by Sen. Ted Kennedy of Massachusetts, who died in 2009. Caroline Kennedy, the senator's niece and the daughter of former President John F. Kennedy, presented Obama with the award. \"Today, when many doubt the integrity of our elected leaders, this award is more important than ever,\" Caroline Kennedy said. She was followed by her son, Jack Schlossberg, who praised Obama for inspiring millions of young people like himself to become politically active. \"Without President Obama, I might still be sitting on my couch eating Doritos and watching sports,\" he said. The Obama-Biden bond appears to still be strong: After thanking the former first lady, Michelle, Obama also took a moment to note the former vice president, \"the best vice president this country's ever known, Mr. Joe Biden.\" Obama is the third president to receive the Profile in Courage Award. Gerald Ford was honored in 2001 for \"making a controversial decision of conscience to pardon former President Richard M. Nixon.\" George H.W. Bush was a recipient in 2014 for the 1990 decision to raise taxes, despite declaring in his 1988 campaign, \"Read my lips: No new taxes.\" Read the full text of Obama's speech: Hello, everybody. Thank you so much. Thank you very much. Thank you. Please, everybody have a seat. Thank you. Thank you very much. Well, first of all, thank you so much, Jack, for that really kind introduction. And I like the socks. I also want to thank you and Rose and Tatiana and your dad for sharing Caroline with us the past few years as America's ambassador to Japan. Caroline, you, true to form, did your country proud, and I'm sure your father and mom would have been proudest of all. I sure was proud, and I'm grateful for your friendship. I want to thank Ken Feinberg for his service as chairman of the John F. Kennedy Library Foundation these past 12 years. He also rendered outstanding service to my administration when we were dealing with the BP oil spill, 9/11. He has rendered public service again and again and again. We're very grateful for him. It is wonderful \u2014 it is wonderful to see Senators Markey and Senator Warren; my dear friend and former governor, Deval Patrick, and his lovely wife, Diane; governors and members of Congress; Cardinal O'Malley; one of the finest secretary of states ever to represent America around the world, John Kerry, and Theresa; and the best vice president this country has ever known, Mr. Joe Biden. I also want to thank Michelle Obama for, after the presidency, sticking with me because I think she felt an obligation to the country to stay on. But once her official duties were over, it wasn't clear. I love my wife. And I'm grateful for her. And I do believe that it was America's great good fortune to have her as first lady. So I am humbled by this evening and to be honored by a family that has given this country so much, a family that's challenged us to ask what we can do for our country, to dream and say why not, a secret cause that endures and to sail against the wind in its pursuit. That's what this family has done for America. And to all the members of the Kennedy family that are here tonight, thank you. I could not be more grateful to the Profile in Courage Award Committee for this honor. I'm also grateful that, unlike the Nobel Prize Committee, you waited until I was out of office. How fitting that we gather here this month, the 100th anniversary of President Kennedy's birth. I was born the year he took office, which makes me 55 years old. Had he lived to finish two terms, he would have been just 51. And he remarked on that possibility once. \"It has been suggested,\" he said, \"that whether I serve one or two terms in the presidency, I will find myself at the end of that period at what might be called the awkward age, too old to begin a career and too young to write my memoirs.\" Now, I hadn't seen this quote when I wrote my first memoir at 33. I'm now in the middle of my second. Moreover, I expect to be busy if not with a second career, then at least a second act. But it is true that I'm at the age, at that turn in the road, where one looks back as well as forward to remember one \u2014 where one has been, so it's better to chart where one is going. And one thing I'm certain is that I was lucky to be born into that new frontier, a new world and a new generation of Americans. My life in many ways would not have been possible without the vision that John F. Kennedy etched into the character and hearts of America. To those of us of a certain age, the Kennedys symbolized a set of values and attitudes about civic life that made it such an attractive calling. The idea that politics in fact could be a noble and worthwhile pursuit. The notion that our problems, while significant, are never insurmountable. The belief that America's promise might embrace those who had once been locked out or left behind and that opportunity and dignity would no longer be restricted to the few but extended to the many. The responsibility that each of us have to play a part in our nation's destiny, and by virtue of being Americans, play a part in the destiny of the world. \u2028I can see truthfully that the example of Jack and Bobby Kennedy helped guide me into politics and that the guidance of Teddy Kennedy made me a better public servant once I arrived in Washington. I have to imagine it would give them great pride to see a new generation of Kennedys, like Joe, carving their own proud paths in public service. For whatever reasons I receive this award, whatever the scale, the challenges that we overcame, and the scope of progress we made over my presidency, it is worth pointing out that in many ways the times that President Kennedy confronted were far more perilous than the ones that we confront today. He entered the Oval Office at just 43, only a few years after Khrushchev had threatened to bury America. Wars raged around the world. Large swaths of the country knew poverty far deeper and more widespread than we see today. A young preacher's cause was just gaining traction against a land segregated not only by custom but by law. And yet in that volatile tinderbox of a time, President Kennedy led with a steady hand, diffusing the most perilous moment of the Cold War without firing a single shot and forcing the rights of young black men and women to study at the university of their choice. Unleashing a corps of young volunteers as ambassadors for peace in distant corners of the globe. Setting America's sights on the moon precisely because it was hard, unwilling to consider the possibility that we might not win the space race because he had an unwavering faith in the character of the people that he led: resilient, optimistic, innovative and courageous. It's worth remembering this, the times in which President Kennedy led us, because for many Americans I know that this feels like an uncertain and even perilous time. The forces of globalization and technology have upended many of our established assumptions about the economy. It provided a great opportunity and also a great inequality and uncertainty for far too many. Our politics remains filled with division and discord, and everywhere we see the risk of falling into the refuge of tribe and clan and anger at those who don't look like us or have the same surnames or pray the way we do. And at such moments, courage is necessary. At such moments, we need courage to stand up to hate not just in others but in ourselves. At such moments, we need the courage to stand up to dogma not just in others but in ourselves. At such moments, we need courage to believe that together we can tackle big challenges like inequality and climate change. At such moments, it's necessary for us to show courage in challenging the status quo and in fighting the good fight but also show the courage to listen to one another and seek common ground and embrace principled compromise. Courage, President Kennedy knew, requires something more than just the absence of fear. Any fool can be fearless. Courage, true courage, derives from that sense of who we are, what are our best selves, what are our most important commitments, and the belief that we can dig deep and do hard things for the enduring benefit of others. And that's why JFK's first inaugural still rings true. That's why Bobby's campaign still means so much. That's why Teddy's cause endures, and we still love him so much. Because of the tragedies that befell each of them, sometimes we forget how fundamentally the story they told us about ourselves changed the trajectory of America. And that's often where courage begins, with the story we tell ourselves about who we are and what's important and about our own capacity to make a difference. We live in a time of great cynicism about our institutions. That's one of the few things that Democrats and Republicans can agree on. It's a cynicism that's most corrosive when it comes to our system of self-government, that clouds our history of jagged, sometimes tentative but ultimately forward progress, that impedes our children's ability to see in the noisy and often too trivial pursuits of politics the possibility of our democracy doing big things. Of course, disdain for elected officials is not new, as many of you in the room can tell others. Sixty years ago, President Kennedy quoted a columnist in \"Profiles in Courage\" who had written, \"People don't give a damn what the average senator or congressman says. The reason they don't care is that they know what you hear in Congress is 99 percent tripe, ignorance, and demagoguery and not to be relied upon.\" Which is perhaps a little harsh. Ninety-nine percent seems high. Eighty-five? But President Kennedy also wrote that \"the complication of public business and the competition for the public's attention have obscured innumerable acts of political courage, large and small, performed almost daily.\" Innumerable acts of political courage large and small performed almost daily. And that is true. I've seen it. I've witnessed it. I've been thinking on this notion of political courage this weekend, in particular about some of the men and women who were elected to Congress the same year I was elected to the White House. Many of them were new to Washington, their entire careers ahead of them. And in that very first term, they had to take tough vote after tough vote because we were in crisis. They took votes to save the financial system and the economy, even when it was highly unpopular. They took votes to save the auto industry when even in Michigan, people didn't want to see bailouts. They took votes to crack down on abuses on Wall Street, despite pressure from lobbyists and sometimes their donors. And they found themselves in the midst of a great debate, a debate that had been going on for decades, a debate that the Kennedy family had participated in and helped lead: a debate about whether a nation as wealthy as the United States of America would finally make health care not a privilege but a right for all Americans. And there was a reason why health care reform had not been accomplished before. It was hard. It involved a sixth of the economy and all manner of stakeholders and interests. It was easily subject to misinformation and fearmongering. And so by the time the vote came up to pass the Affordable Care Act, these freshmen congressmen and women knew that they had to make a choice. That they had a chance to insure millions and prevent untold worry and suffering and bankruptcy, and even death, but that this same vote would likely cost them their new seats, perhaps end their political careers. And these men and women did the right thing. They did the hard thing. Theirs was a profile in courage. Because of that vote, 20 million people got health insurance who didn't have it before. And most of them \u2014 and most of them did lose their seats, but they were true to what President Kennedy defined in his book as a congressional profile in courage: the desire to maintain a reputation for integrity that is stronger than the desire to maintain office, the desire to maintain a reputation for integrity that is stronger than a desire to maintain office, a conscience, personal standard of ethics, integrity, morality that is stronger than the pressures of public disapproval or party disapproval, a faith that the right course would ultimately be vindicated, a faith that overcame fear of public reprisal. It was a personal sacrifice. But I know, because I've spoken to many of them, that they thought and still think it was worth it. As everyone here now knows, this great debate is not settled but continues. And it is my fervent hope and the hope of millions that regardless of party, such courage is still possible, that today's members of Congress, regardless of party, are willing to look at the facts and speak the truth even when it contradicts party positions. I hope that current members of Congress recall that it actually doesn't take a lot of courage to aid those who are already powerful, already comfortable, already influential. But it does require some courage to champion the vulnerable and the sick and the infirm, those who often have no access to the corridors of power. I hope they understand that courage means not simply doing what is politically expedient but doing what they believe deep in their hearts is right. And this kind of courage is required from all of us. Those of us who consider ourselves progressives, those of us who are Democrats, we've got some soul-searching to do to see what kind of courage we show. We have our own dogmas.\u2028Those of us not in elected office have to show some courage. And we're prone to bestow the mantle of courage too easily on the prominent and the powerful and then too eager to wrap ourselves in cynicism when they let us down because they weren't perfect. We lose sight sometimes of our own obligations, each of ours, all the quiet acts of courage that unfold around us every single day, ordinary Americans who give something of themselves not for personal gain but for the enduring benefit of another. The courage of a single mom who is working two jobs to make sure her kid can go to college. The courage of a small-business owner who's keeping folks on the payroll because he knows the family relies on it, even if it's not always the right thing to do bottom line. The courage of somebody who volunteers to help some kids who need help. When we recognize these acts of courage, we then necessarily recognize our own responsibility as citizens and as part of the human family to get involved and to get engaged and to take a stand, to vote, to pay attention. I'm reminded of a story that Teddy once told me about his experiences many years ago when Teddy Jr., now state Senator Ted Kennedy Jr., was sleeping after one of his cancer treatments. And Ted would wander the halls of the hospital and talk with other parents, keeping vigil over their own children. These parents lived in constant fear of what might happen if they couldn't afford the next treatment. Some calculating in their own minds what they might have to sell or borrow just to make it for a few more months, some bargaining with God for whatever they could get. And right there in the quiet of night, working people of modest means and one of the most powerful men in America shared the same intimate and immediate sense of helplessness. And Ted could, of course, afford his son's treatment. But it was that quiet dignified courage of others to endure the most frightening thing imaginable and to do what it takes on behalf of their loved ones that compelled Teddy to make those parents his cause, not out of self-interest but out of a selfless concern for those who suffer. That's what the ordinary courage of everyday people can inspire when you're paying attention, the quiet sturdy courage of ordinary people doing the right thing day in and day out. They don't get attention for it. They don't seek it. They don't get awards for it. But that's what's defined America. I think of women like my grandmother and so many like her who worked their way up from a secretarial pool to management and in the process pushed the glass ceiling just a little bit higher. I think about people like Michelle's dad who, despite MS, got up every single morning. Had to wake up an hour early to button his shirt up and put on his clothes and take those two canes he used and go to work every single day to make sure that he was supporting his family, not missing a dance recital or a basketball game. I think of the troops and the cops and the first responders that I've met who have put themselves at risk for strangers they will never know. And business owners who make every kind of sacrifice they can to make sure that their workers have a shot. And workers who take the risk of starting a new career, retraining at my age. Kids in the Peace Corps working to build bridges of understanding in other nations and spread the same values that helped bring down an iron curtain, banish the scourge of apartheid, expand the boundaries of human freedom. I think of dreamers who suppress their fears to keep working and striving in the only country they've ever called home. And every American who stands up for immigrants because they know that their parents or grandparents or great-grandparents were immigrants too, and they know that America is an idea that only grows stronger with each new person who adopts our common creed. I think of every young activist who answers the injustices still embedded in our criminal justice system not with violence, not with despair, but with peaceful protests and analysis and constructive recommendations for change. I think of the powerless who crossed a bridge in Selma and discovered they had power. Those who gathered at Stonewall and discovered they had a voice. Those who marched on Washington because they believed that they, without an army, without great wealth, could somehow change the very fabric of the greatest power on earth and kept on until they stretched the lofty ideals of our founding to encircle everyone. Every citizen inspired by that history who dips their toes in the water of active democracy for the first time and musters up the determination to try and fail and try again, and sometimes fail again and still try again, knowing their efforts aren't always rewarded right away, because they believe in that upward trajectory of the American story, a story that nobody told better than John F. Kennedy. That very Kennedyesque idea that America is not the project of any one person and that each of us can make a difference and all of us ought to try. That quiet sturdy citizenship that I see all across the country and that I especially see in young people like Jack and Rose and Tatiana, Malia and Sasha, and your kids. I don't know whether President Kennedy's aide and friend, historian Arthur Schlesinger Jr. was right when he wrote that history unfolds in cycles, but I do know that it doesn't move in a straight line. I know that the values and the progress that we cherish are not inevitable, that they are fragile, in need of constant renewal. I've said before that I believe what \u2028Dr. King said, that \"the arc of the moral universe is long but it bends toward justice,\" but I've also said it does not bend on its own. It bends because we bend it, because we put our hand on that arch, and we move it in the direction of justice and freedom and equality and kindness and generosity. It doesn't happen on its own. And so we are constantly having to make a choice because progress is fragile. And it's precisely that fragility, that impermanence, that is a precondition of the quality of character that we celebrate tonight. If the vitality of our democracy, if the gains of our long journey to freedom were assured, none of us would ever have to be courageous. None of us would have to risk anything to protect them. But it's in its very precariousness that courage becomes possible and absolutely necessary. John F. Kennedy knew that our best hope and our most powerful answer to our doubts and to our fears lies inside each of us, in our willingness to joyfully embrace our responsibility as citizens, to stay true to our allegiance, to our highest and best ideals, to maintain our regard and concern for the poor and the aging and the marginalized, to put our personal or party interest aside when duty to our country calls or when conscience demands. That's the spirit that has brought America so far, and that's the spirit that will always carry us to better days. And I take this honor that you have bestowed on me here tonight as a reminder that, even out of office, I must do all that I can to advance the spirit of service that John F. Kennedy represents. Thank you all very much. May God bless you. May he bless these United States of America. Thank you.",

Updated at 10:28 a.m. ET Donald Trump's first speech to a joint session of Congress on Tuesday night was the occasion for his most presidential performance to date, balancing a reprise of his angry campaign themes with a recitation of hopes and dreams for the nation. It was his most successful, if not his first, effort at assuming the public persona and personal demeanor associated with his new office. He stuck to the script on his teleprompter, spoke graciously to individuals in the audience and refrained from attacks on critics, rivals or adversaries. Toward the beginning and again at the end of his 72-minute speech (the longest presidential address to Congress of any kind in 35 years), Trump asked what the nation would look like in 2026 \u2014 the 250th anniversary of its founding. \"Hopefully,\" he said, \"the 250th year for America will see a world that is more peaceful, more just and more free.\" The president began with words of condemnation for the hate crimes lately unleashed on religious and ethnic minorities around the country, including the fatal shooting of an immigrant from India in a suburb of Kansas City. \"Recent threats targeting Jewish Community Centers and vandalism of Jewish cemeteries, as well as last week's shooting in Kansas City, remind us that while we may be a nation divided on policies, we are a country that stands united in condemning hate and evil in all its forms.\" The president, however, did not respond to critics who say these recent acts have been encouraged by some of his own rhetoric or apparent signs of disrespect for targeted groups. Rather, he turned to strikingly poetic sentiments. \"Each American generation passes the torch of truth, liberty and justice \u2014 in an unbroken chain all the way down to the present,\" he said. \"That torch is now in our hands,\" the president said. \"And we will use it to light up the world. I am here tonight to deliver a message of unity and strength, and it is a message deeply delivered from my heart.\" These words early in the speech quickly confirmed the expectation of a softened tone and more inclusive mood. The White House communications staff had promised a speech far more upbeat than any he has delivered in his campaign or in the months since Election Day. The contrast with his \"American carnage\" jeremiad on Inauguration Day was unmistakable and clearly intentional. The success of the big speech strategy seemed immediately apparent. Media coverage was largely positive, even laudatory. Snap polls showed big majorities found the speech optimistic and uplifting. The president's approval rating, which had been at historic lows for a president in his first month in office, is expected to pop back up in the next few soundings. Still, the new president is nothing if not unpredictable. In fact, being unpredictable was a trait mentioned often by candidate Trump, indicating that previous presidents and others negotiating for U.S. interests were too easy to read and counter. So, while he projected a sunnier outlook than he had in other major addresses or in his campaign rallies, he also reiterated the \"America first\" theme several times, including near the top and the end of his remarks. \"America must put its own citizens first,\" the president said, \"because only then can we truly make America great again.\" Trump made it clear he was talking about trade policy, citing the withdrawal from the Trans-Pacific Partnership as one example of his desire for better deals around the globe. But he also returned repeatedly to the topic of immigration. He renewed his pledge to construct \"a great wall on the southern border\" to counter \"lawless chaos\" in that region. He also vowed to create a new agency called VOICE \u2014 for Victims of Immigration Crime Engagement. And it was widely noted that of the first six guests announced to share the first lady's box in the gallery, three had lost immediate family members to violent criminals in the country illegally. \"We are providing a voice to those who have been ignored by our media, and silenced by special interests,\" Trump said. There had been talk throughout Tuesday of a drastic shift in White House policy regarding those in the country illegally. The president had indicated to a luncheon group (of anchors and correspondents from TV news operations) that he might be open to compromise on a path to citizenship, perhaps for those \"dreamers\" who were brought to the U.S. as children by parents entering the country illegally. But in the speech, there was no such talk. All mention of reform was focused on border security, stricter enforcement and economic security for Americans. On domestic policy, the president did stun many in the audience when he said he wanted \"paid family leave\" and an infrastructure package worth $1 trillion. These are both ideas long espoused by the Democratic Party but resisted for decades by business groups and Republicans generally. Few would expect either of these ideas to become law anytime soon. But the president seemed to relish proposing something the Democrats might cheer about, even if they seemed remarkably reluctant to do so. The president also said he wanted to repeal and replace Obamacare, but said the replacement would still cover people with pre-existing conditions. There was no explanation of how that would square with a repeal of the individual mandate by which everyone has to obtain insurance up to minimum government standards. The latter provision is what enables insurers to handle policyholders with expensive conditions. Trump also stated his preference for keeping the tax credits in Obamacare that enable lower income people to afford insurance. That is also a favorite idea of Speaker Paul Ryan, R-Wis., who sat through the speech grinning like a schoolboy. But it is stoutly resisted by both the hard-line House Freedom Caucus and the more mainstream conservative Republican Study Committee. Both see \"a new entitlement\" coming into being if the tax subsidies are made refundable to those with no federal income tax bill (because their income is too low). While President Trump projected a sunnier outlook than he had in other major addresses, he also reiterated the \"America first\" theme several times during his speech to the joint session of Congress.\n                \n                    \n                    Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption While President Trump projected a sunnier outlook than he had in other major addresses, he also reiterated the \"America first\" theme several times during his speech to the joint session of Congress. Nonetheless, Trump and Republican leaders spent the evening acting as though their plan for replacing Obamacare was all but complete and ready for votes. Most observers, though, think the House is a long way from agreement among its own Republican factions. The outlook for Medicaid programs that were expanded as part of Obamacare is typically clouded because some members think it's imperative to replace Obamacare with something new and different immediately. Others are willing to see it done before the end of April or even later, so long as people do not lose coverage en masse. The Tuesday night event was not long on military or foreign policy. The president said he supported \"direct, robust and meaningful engagement with the world\" and wanted to stay in NATO. He also asserted that certain NATO nations had begun spending more on their own defense, responding to his threats and prodding. It was not immediately clear what basis he had for this. Trump did reiterate U.S. support for Israel and opposition to ISIS. He did not mention North Korea, Iran or Russia. The latter country has been much in the news because U.S. intelligence has described its efforts to meddle in last year's presidential election. Lately, stories based on anonymous sources have said Russian officials had regular and extensive contacts with Trump supporters during the election cycle. Democrats in Congress have been seeking either an independent prosecutor to pursue the case or a special committee of both the House and Senate. Republican leaders have said there is no evidence to justify such efforts. But soon after Trump's inauguration, the intelligence committees in both the House and the Senate began their own respective inquiries. The president also produced the most emotionally powerful moment of the evening when he introduced the widow of William \"Ryan\" Owens, a Navy SEAL killed in a special operations raid against a terrorist site in Yemen just days after Trump took office. Carryn Owens was honored by a standing ovation by everyone visible in the vast House chamber, regardless of party or position. She wept openly, clasped her hands and looked upward as the ovation continued for several minutes. When it finally subsided, the president said, \"Ryan is looking down right now and he's happy because I think you broke a record.\" The Yemeni raid remains controversial, and Owens' father had refused to meet with Trump when he came to greet the returning remains at Dover Air Force Base in Delaware. The father said he wanted an investigation to find out why the raid had been conducted, why his son and nearly 30 civilians had died and what the raid had accomplished. After Owens' father raised questions about the raid, NBC News reported that the operation \"has so far yielded no significant intelligence.\" Contradicting that report, Trump said Tuesday night he had been assured by Secretary of Defense James Mattis that the raid was a success and that it captured intelligence that will be of value for a long time \u2014 and Vice President Pence told CBS News on Wednesday morning that the NBC report was \"wrong.\"",

Desiree Armas (right) and her parents are living in the country illegally.\n                \n                    \n                    Joel Rose/NPR\n                    \n                \nhide caption The Armas family is traveling to Washington, D.C., for an immigrant rights protest this weekend. Desiree Armas (right) and her parents are living in the country illegally. This story is part of Kitchen Table Conversations, a series from NPR's National Desk that examines how Americans from all walks of life are moving forward from the presidential election. In some ways, Desiree Armas is your typical high school senior. She's getting ready to take the test for her driver's license. And she's applying to colleges. But Armas has a big secret. She rides the bus an hour each way to a magnet school miles away from her family's apartment. And her friends don't know that Armas and her parents are living in the country illegally. \"Only my best friend knows. No one else in school, besides my counselors,\" Armas says. \"That's something I don't tell anyone. Because you never know.\" President-elect Donald Trump has pledged to deport millions of immigrants living in the country illegally. And that's creating even more uncertainty for thousands of families. Many of those families \u2014 including the Armases \u2014 will travel to Washington, D.C., this weekend for a rally focusing on the rights of immigrants. Desiree Armas left Peru with her parents when she was 3. Today the family lives in a small, tidy apartment in working-class Elizabeth, N.J. Desiree's mother, Olga Armas, says the family first arrived in the U.S. in 2002 and stayed to seek a better future for their daughter. \"The beginning was very hard,\" Olga Armas says through a translator. \"It was difficult to come. We arrived here with nothing to a lot of uncertainty. No pans or pots or even a spoon.\" In Peru, Olga's college-educated husband, Carlos, had a white-collar job with an airline. In New Jersey, he gets up at 4 a.m. to load pallets at a paper warehouse. When his parents died, Carlos Armas couldn't go back for their funerals. \"I withstood that because I wanted my daughters to stay in school,\" he says through a translator. \"And my family to stay together here, that they continue to study.\" Desiree is a straight-A student. So the family was thrilled when President Obama introduced a program called Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, or DACA, allowing immigrants who were brought to the country illegally as kids to work and attend college. As soon as Desiree was old enough to apply, Olga Armas says, the whole family went to the lawyer's office together to fill out the paperwork. \"My daughter was so happy, she cried,\" says Armas. \"We cried, because my daughter can come out of the dark.\" Desiree Armas says getting DACA made a huge difference. Her younger sister Kimberly, who was born in Florida, is a citizen. And Desiree admits, she's a little jealous. \"I see my sister's passport. And like, I don't know, something about it just gets me all like sappy for some reason, that I can't have one,\" she says. \"But when I got my Social Security [card], it felt, like, so official. Like I was way more positive. I was more hopeful.\" But Armas' hopes may have suffered a setback on election night. President-elect Trump has pledged to deport millions of immigrants living in the country illegally, although he has also said he doesn't want to break up families. And Trump has committed to rolling back President Obama's immigration policies, including DACA. \"The truth is, people are in limbo,\" says Olga Armas. \"We don't know what will come [from] Trump's words. But everybody is talking about it, there is lots of fear.\" For Olga Armas, the fear is that what her family has gained could all go away. She's volunteering with Make the Road New Jersey, an activist group that works for immigrants' rights. She's helping to bring protesters to Washington for this weekend's rally. Without DACA, her daughter could still be accepted to college. But losing her legal status would make it harder for Desiree Armas to find the money for school, or to work at a job or internship once she gets there. She says kids with DACA want the same thing immigrants to this country have always wanted. \"What you have now, your parents had to fight for it,\" Armas says. \"And that's what our parents are doing. That's what we are doing. Not just me, just so many other students that are hard-working \u2014 and deserve a chance to show what we got. And if you take that away from us, you will yank the dreams of future doctors and engineers and lawyers.\" So Desiree Armas is anxiously watching her mailbox for two reasons. Acceptance letters from the colleges she's applied to, and news about her future in this country.",

Every year for the past few years, I've dusted off my crystal ball and offered a few predictions for the new year. Back on Nov. 9 though, I threw out the ones I had been working on and started over. The election of Donald Trump altered the landscape for K-12 and higher education and created greater political uncertainty in the debate over how to improve schools. Here's my revised, updated list of predictions for 2017. Education Prediction No. 1: It is unclear how government will use federal funding for the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA).\n                \n                    \n                    LA Johnson/NPR\n                    \n                \nhide caption Donald Trump's focus on school choice, vouchers and his overall ambivalence about the federal role in education will complicate matters for ESSA (the Every Student Succeeds Act). That's the recently revised federal law through which billions of dollars flow to states and local school districts. Most of that money targets low-income kids and students with learning disabilities. Now, though, how that money is distributed and who gets it is an open question. The new administration is likely to encourage more private, for-profit groups to compete with public schools for that money. Watch for a significant disruption in 2017 as states try to figure out how the Education Department under Trump will move forward, especially on education funding and government sponsored vouchers. As Randi Weingarten, president of the American Federation of Teachers warns: \"There will be a war.\" Which leads to: Education Prediction No. 2: Teachers unions will butt heads with the new administration.\n                \n                    \n                    LA Johnson/NPR\n                    \n                \nhide caption Education Prediction No. 2: Teachers unions will butt heads with the new administration. Both the American Federation of Teachers and the National Education Association \u2014 the nation's two largest teachers unions \u2014 have vowed to oppose much of Trump's education agenda. The biggest fights will unfold in GOP-led states where lawmakers have long argued that unions stand in the way of promising reforms because they're more interested in their dues-paying members than they are in children. These political skirmishes will test the political power of unions like never before. I predict that in 2017 we will see unprecedented legal challenges to collective bargaining rights and the unions' power to collect dues. Education Prediction No. 3: The future is grim for early childhood education funding, which will lead to lower enrollment.\n                \n                    \n                    LA Johnson/NPR\n                    \n                \nhide caption My third prediction is that one of the casualties of a leaner federal education budget will be early childhood education. Remember that the Obama administration supported the expansion of quality preschool because of the social and academic benefits that the research is pointing to. This created incentives in many states to invest more of their own money in preschool programs by matching federal funds for programs targeting low-income children. I predict that money for early childhood education is going to shrink, or worse, we could see cuts across the board that will result in a drop in pre-K enrollment in 2017. Education Prediction No. 4: The charter school movement splits over political differences.\n                \n                    \n                    LA Johnson/NPR\n                    \n                \nhide caption Education Prediction No. 4: The charter school movement splits over political differences. The conflict and tension over charter schools will intensify in 2017. The Trump administration's unconditional support for privately run, public-funded charter schools will split the 25-year-old movement. Conservative sponsors of charters will side with Trump and his nominee for education secretary \u2014 Betsy DeVos. She has long been a champion of charters in her home state of Michigan. They will push for a major expansion of charter schools by shifting more federal dollars to charters and by pressuring states to lift the cap (in 22 states) on their growth. Many conservatives view public education as a government monopoly and are intent on putting traditional public schools out of business through competition \u2014 notably with privately run charters. This is their chance. On the flip side, liberals and moderates in the charter movement who aren't exactly fans of Donald Trump or DeVos favor a less adversarial relationship with traditional public schools and want greater collaboration. I predict that many of the nation's 6,800 charter schools will either play down their support for Trump's school-choice agenda or separate themselves from it. Education Prediction No. 5: Community colleges get their long-overdue attention.\n                \n                    \n                    LA Johnson/NPR\n                    \n                \nhide caption Education Prediction No. 5: Community colleges get their long-overdue attention. Community colleges will finally get more of the attention they've been clamoring for. These institutions enroll more than half of all students who go on to some kind of postsecondary education. The mission of community colleges \u2014 to educate and retrain Americans from all walks of life \u2014 will likely get support from Trump, who has often promised to focus on jobs, jobs and more jobs as part of his plan to rebuild the nation's economy and workforce. Expanding higher education options tied to training and actual jobs should give community colleges a prominent role in helping Trump push his economic agenda. Will community colleges get the recognition, funding and resources they need to fulfill their mission? I say there's a good chance they will. In my last year's predictions, I went 3-for-6. Here's how they played out: The New Federal Education Law.  I predicted last year that the end of the \"long grueling fight to overhaul the No Child Left Behind law\" would bring some relief to states that had viewed NCLB as heavy-handed. So yes, states and local school districts are now breathing easier. Although ESSA now gives states more discretion in evaluating schools, they continue to rely heavily on test results to gauge performance \u2014 rather than improve instruction \u2014 as I predicted. Civil rights groups meanwhile also lived up to my prediction that they would mobilize around the issues of too much testing and charters, with the NAACP calling for a moratorium on the latter. Charter Schools Under A Microscope. I predicted that charter schools would come under much more scrutiny. They did, certainly judging by the big increase in media coverage of scandals, fraud and corruption across the country, especially in Ohio, Pennsylvania, Michigan, Georgia and California. I also predicted that charters would be one of the very few education issues that would get any attention from the presidential candidates and, sure enough, Donald Trump has made charters a cornerstone of his school choice agenda Moving On From Common Core. The controversy and uproar over the common core standards did in fact diminish in 2016 and the \"rebranding\" has continued. Dreamers Dreams Deferred. Despite the heated rhetoric over immigration in 2016, my prediction that there would be a backlash against so-called Dreamers kind of fizzled. The debate over how to deal with these students who were brought to the U.S. as toddlers by parents who entered the country illegally didn't die down entirely, but there was no crackdown even in states where lawmakers oppose efforts to give these students amnesty or a path to citizenship. I would argue, however, that the ongoing stalemate over immigration reform has pushed Dreamers deeper into a legal and educational limbo, as I predicted last year. Goodbye Race-Conscious Admissions. My prediction that the U.S. Supreme Court's ruling, in a case involving the University of Texas at Austin, would ban race in college admissions was a dud, for good reason however. Who could have known that Justice Antonin Scalia would die? He was expected to vote against UT's use of race to create a more diverse undergraduate student body. His vote could have made it a 5-4 ruling and race-conscious admissions policies would have been banned. Instead, it was a 4-3 vote the other way, upholding the University of Texas policy (Justice Elena Kagan was recused). Student Debt Takes Center Stage. College costs and affordability were the focus of my sixth and final prediction. It definitely got lots of attention in 2016, especially from presidential candidates Bernie Sanders and Hillary Clinton. I suggested that all this attention to how expensive and out-of-reach college has become for many Americans would put lots of pressure on ivory tower-types to lower costs or at least begin moving towards more reasonable pricing policies. That didn't happen. Still, it doesn't mean higher education is off the hook. College access and affordability remains a big problem that's not going away.",

            "article_content": "In a surprise move, President Trump is siding with top Democrats in a deal to raise the debt ceiling. Also, D\u00e1nica Coto of The Associated Press talks about Hurricane Irma's path through the Caribbean.  RACHEL MARTIN, HOST: So there is a whole lot that President Trump wants from Congress - Hurricane Harvey relief, a fix for DACA, maybe a border wall. MARY LOUISE KELLY, HOST: That is all true, Rachel. But first, there's a small matter of avoiding a government shutdown. The president needs Congress to raise the debt ceiling. And that led to quite the meeting yesterday at the White House with leading Republicans and Democrats. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: We had a very good meeting with Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer. MARTIN: Nancy and Chuck - not exactly the names you'd expect to hear the president talking positively about. KELLY: No, I think that's pretty much got to be a first. And - there's more - it apparently wasn't just a very good meeting. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) TRUMP: We essentially came to a deal, and I think the deal will be very good. KELLY: A deal with top Democrats - that is not a headline we get to report every day. MARTIN: Nope. KELLY: And - no. As you might expect, that is a development that not many Republicans are thrilled with. MARTIN: All right, NPR's Mara Liasson was traveling with the president yesterday. She joins us now on the line. Mara, what the heck happened during this meeting? MARA LIASSON, BYLINE: Well, the president had the Republican and Democratic leadership over to the White House. Republicans were actually there; you'd hardly know that by his comments. But the Democrats made an offer, Harvey funding plus a three-month extension on the debt ceiling and a three-month measure to keep the government running until mid-December. Republicans didn't like that deal at all. Earlier in the day, Paul Ryan had called it ridiculous and disgraceful. Republicans wanted a much longer hike in the debt limit so that their members didn't have to vote on this unpopular item more than once before the next election. But the next thing you know, the president said to the Democrats, you've got a deal. MARTIN: And he said it - I mean, in the moment - in real time. He was just sitting there in front of leadership of his own party, making a deal with the opposition. So clearly, Mitch McConnell, Paul Ryan - not so happy in this moment. LIASSON: Not so happy. They were blindsided. One member who was traveling with the president on Air Force One said he gasped when he heard this. But it sounds like the guy who wrote \"The Art Of The Deal\" wanted a deal, almost any deal. And he didn't really care who he made it with. MARTIN: So what does all this mean for DACA, the fix that Congress is supposed to push through and a tax overhaul? LIASSON: Right. Well, Republicans think this gives Democrats more leverage in the DACA debate. The president said he wants DACA turned into legislation. He thinks he can get it. Yesterday on Air Force One, he said, Chuck and Nancy would like to see something happen. And so do I. On taxes, the Republicans feel that the president also gave the Democrats more leverage because they're under tremendous pressure now to finish the tax reform debate, the tax cut debate, by mid-December because that's when all of these big must-past issues come back - the debt ceiling, government funding - and that Democrats are going to have more leverage in tax reform because they know that all these other issues have to be revisited in December and the window is now very short. MARTIN: I mean, we should just say it was kind of a secret fear of Republicans that President Trump might turn out to be someone who would make deals with Democrats. And they wouldn't be so happy about that. LIASSON: Right. We don't know if this is the beginning of some new kind of triangulation, but we do know it comes after weeks of the president attacking members of his own party, including Mitch McConnell. MARTIN: So meanwhile, the Russia investigations are continuing. And a revelation - Facebook says that during the presidential campaign, it sold political ads to a Russian firm targeting certain voters. What can you... LIASSON: Right. This is something... MARTIN: ...Tell us about that? LIASSON: This is something the intelligence committees are very interested in. Facebook apparently sold ads to a Russian company who was targeting voters. The big question is, how did they know which voters to target? Did the Trump campaign help them? Also, today Donald Trump Jr. is going to be interviewed behind closed doors by the Senate judiciary committee staff. And of course, they're going to be interested in talking to him about that June 2016 meeting at Trump Tower with Russian lawyer. MARTIN: Yeah. KELLY: And key question there, behind closed doors, so we wait to see... LIASSON: Right. We're not going to hear anything about that testimony. KELLY: Who next - will we get to see him behind open doors? MARTIN: Behind open doors - in front of open doors. KELLY: Will we actually get to hear what he says at some point? MARTIN: Yeah. KELLY: That may be in the works. MARTIN: NPR national political correspondent Mara Liasson - thanks so much, Mara. LIASSON: Thank you. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) MARTIN: Now to Hurricane Irma, which has already left horrific damage in its path as it crosses the Caribbean. KELLY: Several people have died. And then there's the physical destruction. Nearly every building on the island of Barbuda has serious damage. Hundreds of people there are now homeless. Puerto Rico, meanwhile, managed to escape a direct hit. But heavy rains, strong winds have knocked out a lot of that island's power. And Irma now is headed towards the Dominican Republic and Haiti. MARTIN: And we've already got parts of Florida under mandatory evacuation orders as Irma gets ready to arrive there possibly this weekend. So we've got NPR's Greg Allen on the line from Miami, also The Associated Press' Danica Coto, who is on the line from San Juan, Puerto Rico. Danica, I want to start with you. You're there in Puerto Rico. Can you just give us a sense of the damage that this storm has caused to date? DANICA COTO: Yes. Good morning. I mean, the storm has been devastating for the northeast Caribbean. French Interior Minister Gerard Collomb told the French radio, France Info, that at least eight people and 23 - eight people have died, and 23 people have been injured in St. Martin and St. Barts. At this point, it's hard to get a clear idea of the extent of the devastation. At daybreak, you know, officials will go out. And officials have said that this number could grow. And - as well, damage was reported in the neighboring Dutch Caribbean island of St. Maarten. MARTIN: I mean, last night on cable TV, the leader of the island of Barbuda was saying that - I mean, their island had just been totally destroyed. He said 95 percent of the structures had been ruined. And that island had been without communication for several hours. I mean, how are things looking just - you're in San Juan right now. So what are things looking like in Puerto Rico? COTO: Correct. Well, I think Puerto Rico was spared the devastation that was seen elsewhere, especially in Barbuda. You know, 60 percent of people are homeless there. Roads, telecommunication systems were destroyed. You know, the recovery could take months, possibly years. And a 2-year-old child also died in Barbuda. So compare that to Puerto Rico - here, I think the main concern is power outages. There's more than 1 million people without power, and that represents about 68 percent of the power company's customers. The power company director has not said when exactly power will come back. He expects to go out - crews expect to go out today and assess the damage. One of the main focuses is on the tiny island of Culebra, which lies just northeast of Puerto Rico and is very popular with tourists. And that island was hit with wind gusts of up to 110 miles per hour. So again, you know, at daybreak, we'll get a better sense... MARTIN: Yeah. COTO: ...Of the extent of the damage. MARTIN: Right. I want to move to Greg Allen, who is in Florida covering all of this. Greg, so - the governor there, Rick Scott, said several times yesterday, everyone needs to get out. I mean, there was a mandatory evacuation for the Keys, for some parts of southern Florida. But he just said, you can't take any risks. Let's listen to this tape. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) RICK SCOTT: We are being very aggressive in our preparation for this storm. And every Floridian should take this seriously and be aggressive to protect their family. Possessions can be replaced; your family cannot. MARTIN: So what's it been like in Miami? GREG ALLEN, BYLINE: Well, I think there's a lot of anxiety here, Rachel. And it's kind of based around the fact that people just know this is going to be the - possibly the big one. I think it's fueled somewhat by Harvey, seeing what happened to Houston. But over the weekend, people started getting ready here, which is very early. By Tuesday, we saw gasoline lines and lines outside retailers selling propane. You can't find water or batteries in any of the stores here, although we'll probably get some more shipments before the - Irma hits. But this thing about complacency that we've often heard about in the past - you know, we haven't been hit by a major hurricane here in many years - it didn't happen this year. People are taking it very seriously. We have these mandatory evacuations in Miami-Dade County, Broward, in the Florida Keys, as you say. MARTIN: Are people heeding those? ALLEN: We will see today in Miami-Dade County. But my sense is yes. The people I've talked to when I was out doing my interviews were already - were boarding their houses and getting ready to leave. Many people are getting out, so we'll see how they take the evacuation order today. MARTIN: What do we know about the latest information on exactly what the path is of the hurricane? What part of the state is likely to be most affected? ALLEN: Well, we know - the meteorologists tell us over and over again not to focus on the individual path because we have to get ready no matter what. MARTIN: Yeah. ALLEN: And that's true. It's still 180-mile-per-hour winds in this Category 5 storm. It's potentially going to bring a 17-foot storm surge - or a large storm surge when it comes. We don't know how big it will be. But it - well, the track - right now, it's heading west, and it will turn to the north sometime probably around Saturday. And where that turn comes is what's going to really be key for what parts of the state get affected. What we're seeing from many of the models, that it would come right up the center of the state. So that's where it could - so we all have to be ready and be concerned about that. MARTIN: Have you boarded up your windows? Have you bought your water? ALLEN: I'm pretty much prepared. I think we'll probably put our shutters up today. We've - a lot of - most of my neighbors have the shutters up already. So yes, we're going to be ready by Friday, I think, for sure and probably by the end of the day today. MARTIN: All right, NPR's Greg Allen in Miami. We also heard from the AP's Danica Coto reporting in San Juan, Puerto Rico. Hurricane Irma has already struck Puerto Rico and much of the Caribbean. It is leaning now towards South Florida. We will be covering it all. Thanks to both of you this morning. ALLEN: You're welcome. COTO: Thank you.

            "article_content": "After nine months in office, President Trump has found the many issues of immigration more vexing than he may have imagined \u2014 something Trump has in common with a long line of predecessors.  RENEE MONTAGNE, HOST: The White House began last week with a list of demands to Congress on immigration. President Trump is tying those demands to any legislative deal to protect DREAMers, those nearly 800,000 young immigrants brought here illegally as children. The Trump administration has revised its insistence on constructing a southern border wall and is also insisting on tougher laws on people seeking asylum. The issue of immigration has often put presidents at odds with Congress. And when we want a bit of history, we turn to Professor Ron. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) MONTAGNE: You know him is NPR senior editor and correspondent Ron Elving. RON ELVING, BYLINE: In 1790, with the American Republic still in its infancy, Congress passed its first big bill about immigrants and citizenship. It was called the Naturalization Act. And it set the rules by which new arrivals could achieve citizenship as though they were, quote, \"natural\" which is to say born in the U.S. Before long, that act was getting quite a workout. Over the course of the 19th and early 20th century, there were millions of new arrivals. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) UNIDENTIFIED MAN: And now as the 20th century begins, the homeless, the tentless tourists come as never before searching for a new life, a new world in a new century. ELVING: Congress passed laws along the way strictly limiting certain nationalities. But by and large, the spirit of the Statue of Liberty prevailed as she lifted her lamp beside the golden door. President John F. Kennedy embraced a policy based on the nation of immigrants concept which he described in this memorable speech from January 1963. (SOUNDBITE OF SPEECH) JOHN F KENNEDY: It is a proud privilege to be a citizen of the great republic - to realize that we are the descendants of 40 million people who left other countries, other familiar scenes to come here to the United States to build a new life, to make a new opportunity for themselves and their children. ELVING: In 1965, Kennedy's successor Lyndon Johnson steered to passage the most sweeping immigration change in generations, emphasizing the reuniting of families over considerations of national origin, race and ancestry. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) LYNDON B JOHNSON: This bill says simply that from this day for those wishing to emigrate to America shall be admitted on the basis of their skills and their close relationships to those already here. ELVING: Many conservatives felt the 1965 law allowed too many people to enter the country without proper vetting - new arrivals who might take jobs away from native-born Americans. But the Republican party was divided on the question. And in the mid-1980s, President Ronald Reagan would grant amnesty to millions of those who had entered the U.S. illegally. In his run for re-election in 1984, Reagan was quite forthright in saying he had embraced amnesty. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) RONALD REAGAN: But it is true our borders are out of control. It is also true that this has been a situation on our borders back through a number of administrations. And I supported this bill. I believe in the idea of amnesty for those who have put down roots and who have lived here even though some time back they may have entered illegally. ELVING: Johnson and Reagan were able to work with both parties and with the factions within their own parties to fashion these landmark bills. Their successors in the White House have found the issue more vexing. President Bill Clinton, in his 1995 State of the Union Address, had this to say on the subject. (SOUNDBITE OF SPEECH) BILL CLINTON: We are a nation of immigrants, but we are also a nation of laws. It is wrong and ultimately self-defeating for a nation of immigrants to permit the kind of abuse of our immigration laws we have seen in recent years. And we must do more to stop it. (APPLAUSE) ELVING: The next President George W. Bush was a Republican but far friendlier to immigration than many in his party. In 2007, he backed a comprehensive effort to overhaul the immigration laws, a measure supported by more Democrats in Congress than Republicans. GEORGE W BUSH: We need to resolve the status of the illegal immigrants who are already in our country without animosity and without amnesty. (APPLAUSE) BUSH: Convictions run deep in his capital when it comes to immigration. Let us have a serious, civil and conclusive debate so that you can pass and I can sign comprehensive immigration reform into law. (APPLAUSE) ELVING: But Congress did not put such a bill on President Bush's desk. President Barack Obama came to office promising action where his predecessor had fallen short. And in 2012, he issued an executive order deferring deportation for those sometimes called the DREAMers, individuals brought to the U.S. as children. It was called D.A.C.A or DACA, an acronym for Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals. But Obama wanted something more comprehensive than that, something enshrined in law. And he outlined his goals. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) BARACK OBAMA: To mend our nation's immigration policy, to make it more fair, more efficient and more just. ELVING: But the resulting bill produced by the so-called Gang of Eight in the Senate could not reach the 60 votes needed to overcome a Republican filibuster. So Obama issued a series of executive orders attempting to allow certain immigrants to stay in the U.S. if they, quote, \"came out of the shadows,\" unquote. Which brings us to President Trump, who in August announced a plan to emphasize skills and other assets that immigrants might bring with them that would qualify the new entrants, reversing more than 50 years of policy emphasis on family connections. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: As a candidate, I campaigned on creating a merit-based immigration system that protects U.S. workers and taxpayers. And that is why we are here today - merit-based. ELVING: Then Trump announced that DACA would end in March 2018 and called on Congress to address the situation by legislation. Some in Congress hope not only to preserve Daka but to enact that comprehensive overhaul of immigration policy that has eluded lawmakers and presidents since Reagan. But the prospects for bipartisan action may be bleaker today than at any time in those three decades. I'm Ron Elving, NPR News, Washington.

Lawmakers have less than two weeks of legislative days to head off a government shutdown, raise the nation's borrowing limit and provide financial assistance in the aftermath of Hurricane Harvey. Congress is back after a monthlong break, although it may not have seemed like Washington was on vacation based on the pace of political news in August. The racist protests in Charlottesville, Va., a historic hurricane in Texas, White House staff firings, the president picking fights with GOP leaders, a revived Afghanistan military strategy and a controversial presidential pardon of former Sheriff Joe Arpaio, each in its own way is testing the relationship, trust and expectations surrounding what President Trump and Congress can accomplish this year. Republicans are hoping for a comeback after a disappointing first half of 2017, when unified GOP control of Washington yielded little in terms of major legislative accomplishments. The goal is an ambitious overhaul of the entire federal tax code that aims to lower rates for every business and household in America. Republicans have pledged to have it signed into law by the end of the year. But first, Washington has to avoid another round of self-inflicted, familiar crises, address impending deadlines and resolve unanticipated legislative demands before Sept. 30, the end of the fiscal year. The Jewish holidays also truncate this month's legislative schedule, giving lawmakers just 12 days to tick off the following to-do list: 1. Keep the government running: The federal government runs out of money Sept. 30, so Congress has two options: 2. Avoid the first-ever default: Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin told Fox News the Trump administration is asking Congress to approve the debt-limit increase as part of the emergency funding bill for hurricane relief efforts. \"The president and I believe that it should be tied to the Harvey funding,\" Mnuchin said. \"Our first priority is to make sure that the state gets money. It is critical. And to do that, we need to make sure we raise the debt limit.\" House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., and Senate Minority Leader Charles Schumer, D-N.Y., indicated in a joint statement they'd be willing to assist the administration to that end. \"Providing aid in the wake of Harvey and raising the debt limit are both important issues, and Democrats want to work to do both,\" they said. That approach could put the administration on a collision course with conservatives. Freedom Caucus Chairman Rep. Mark Meadows, R-N.C., has already warned the administration to keep the two issues separate. \"The Harvey relief would pass on its own, and to use that as a vehicle to get people to vote for a debt ceiling is not appropriate,\" Meadows told The Washington Post last week. Republicans in Congress like to try to use the debt limit as a leverage vote to extract concessions elsewhere \u2014 like spending cuts. But since Republicans are certain to need Democratic votes to approve the increase, their leverage is limited. 3. Begin Hurricane Harvey relief efforts: The House is scheduled to vote this week on the first installment of what are expected to be several aid packages to assist Hurricane Harvey recovery efforts. Last Friday, the administration formally requested an initial $7.85 billion for Harvey response and recovery efforts. Harvey relief should be relatively easy to approve, but conservatives in the past have griped about disaster spending without offsets elsewhere in the budget. Some conservatives are also warning party leaders not to add Harvey relief to any other must-pass legislation, like the debt limit, which the White House wants to do. 4. Renew the National Flood Insurance Program: Congress has to vote to reauthorize the flood program by Sept. 30. It's already $25 billion in debt, and losses from Hurricane Harvey threaten to send it even deeper into the red. The program is administered through the Federal Emergency Management Agency and provides federally guaranteed flood coverage to nearly 5 million policyholders. Texas' Harris County, which includes Houston, has nearly 250,000 policyholders. Some lawmakers want to fundamentally overhaul the program, but a broader debate could be harder when Americans are suffering in real time. 5. Renew children's health care: Congress must reauthorize the popular Children's Health Insurance Program by Sept. 30 so that states don't begin running out of money. It covers children up to age 19 whose families earn too much to qualify for Medicaid but are still in need. It's relatively uncontroversial but more popular among Democrats. It could also be a must-pass vehicle that GOP leaders use to attach less popular legislation \u2014 like a debt-limit increase \u2014 because Democratic votes will be necessary for passage on this bill as well. 6. Face reality on health care: The Trump administration is keeping the pressure on Republicans in Congress to try to revive the failed effort to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act. The clock is running out: The special budget rules that Republicans employed to get around the Senate's 60-vote filibuster rules expire on Sept. 30. That means Congress has to act or move on. Every indication, at least in the Senate, is that it is ready to move on. Senate health committee Chairman Lamar Alexander, R-Tenn., is holding hearings with ranking member Patty Murray, D-Wash., to see whether they can come up with a bipartisan bill to address the immediate needs of the individual health care market. While those are the must-pass bills on the September agenda, this month will also see work on other legislation and more ambitious goals for this year. Congress needs to approve the annual defense authorization bill, made more urgent this fall because of the rising North Korea threat and Trump's new Afghanistan strategy. It is also Arizona GOP Sen. John McCain's legislation. Action on the bill was delayed so McCain could undergo treatment for brain cancer. He is expected to return to the Senate this month to oversee its expected passage. Republicans also still need to pass a budget resolution that outlines the broad contours of what they aim to do on the tax code. Republicans are once again planning to use the budget reconciliation process to pass a tax bill, because Democrats can't filibuster that. Congressional Republicans spent August trying to promote their tax efforts, although that message was largely ignored amid the natural disaster in Texas and the president's poor handling of the events in Charlottesville that left a woman dead after a white nationalist rally. If Republicans intend to enact a tax bill by year's end, lawmakers will need to unveil legislation in the coming weeks to keep it on track. Congress may also need to add immigration legislation to its 2017 to-do list. The Trump administration is expected to announce what comes next for the Obama-era program that protects children brought to the U.S. illegally by their parents from deportation. Republican leaders, like House Speaker Paul Ryan, R-Wis., and Senate Finance Chairman Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, are asking the administration to hold off in order to give Congress time to come up with a legislative fix. If the administration moves to end the program, Congress may have to act sooner than party leaders would like on an issue that sharply divides the GOP. Outside the Beltway, there are two happenings in September that could shake the political calculus in Washington: Sen. Robert Menendez, D-N.J., is due in court to face corruption charges. The trial begins Wednesday in Newark, N.J., and is expected to last six to eight weeks. Menendez has denied any wrongdoing. If he is found guilty, he will face pressure to resign his Senate seat. But with Republican Gov. Chris Christie in office, Menendez is unlikely to walk away from a safe Democratic seat that could end up in GOP hands in an already narrowly divided Senate. Down South, Republican incumbent Sen. Luther Strange of Alabama is in a competitive Sept. 26 runoff for the GOP nomination against conservative former Judge Roy Moore. Trump and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell have endorsed Strange, who was appointed to the seat after GOP Sen. Jeff Sessions was tapped to serve as attorney general. But Moore has an enthusiastic conservative following and could pull off the upset. If so, Democrats believe there's a glimmer of a possibility to make it a race in the general election this December.",

            "article_content": "La La Land was a big winner at Sunday night's Golden Globe awards. So was Moonlight, and the TV series The People v. O.J. Simpson. Plus, the stars had plenty to say about President-elect Trump.  STEVE INSKEEP, HOST: Now, when Hollywood stars gathered last night for the Golden Globe Awards, much of the attention focused on a certain recently promoted reality TV star. NPR's Mandalit del Barco reports. MANDALIT DEL BARCO, BYLINE: President-elect Donald Trump's name may not have been uttered on stage, but he and the election he won were referenced throughout the show. It started with host Jimmy Fallon's monologue. (SOUNDBITE OF 74TH GOLDEN GLOBE AWARDS) JIMMY FALLON: This is the Golden Globes, one of the few places left where America still honors the popular vote. But... (LAUGHTER) DEL BARCO: Fallon joked about the company that tabulates the award show ballots. (SOUNDBITE OF 74TH GOLDEN GLOBE AWARDS) FALLON: The accounting firm of Ernst and Young and Putin. But here we go. DEL BARCO: And he referred to the Golden Globes-nominated movie \"Florence Foster Jenkins.\" (SOUNDBITE OF 74TH GOLDEN GLOBE AWARDS) FALLON: The world's worst opera singer, and even she turned down performing at Donald Trump's inauguration. It's tough to book. It's tough to book. DEL BARCO: The star of that movie is actress Meryl Streep, who was nominated for that role and honored for her lifetime achievements by the Hollywood Foreign Press Association. In accepting that award, she used her platform to defend what she called some of the most vilified segments of America - Hollywood, foreigners and the press. Streep says she was appalled at the performance given by candidate Trump when he mocked a disabled news reporter. (SOUNDBITE OF 74TH GOLDEN GLOBE AWARDS) MERYL STREEP: It kind of broke my heart when I saw it. And I still can't get it out of my head because it wasn't in a movie. It was real life. And this instinct to humiliate, when it's modeled by someone on the public platform, by someone powerful, it filters down into everybody's life because it kind of gives permission for other people to do the same thing. Disrespect invites disrespect. Violence incites violence. When the powerful use their position to bully others, we all lose. DEL BARCO: Though her voice was hoarse, Streep made a loud plea for empathy. Trump told The New York Times he did not watch the Golden Globes, and he dismissed Meryl Streep as a Hillary lover. The reality TV star told the Times he was not surprised that he'd come under attack from what he called, quote, \"liberal movie people.\" Television people were also honored last night, including FX's \"Atlanta\" and \"The People V. O.J. Simpson: American Crime Story.\" The Hollywood Foreign Press Association also gave awards to AMC's \"The Night Manager\" and \"The Crown\" on Netflix. \"Elle\" won for best foreign film, and actress Isabelle Huppert, who starred in it, won best actress in a drama. Casey Affleck won for his role in \"Manchester By The Sea.\" And the best dramatic picture award went to \"Moonlight.\" Onstage, Director Barry Jenkins thanked his mother in Miami for inspiring him. Backstage, he told reporters that as the country moves into a new presidential administration, films should continue to tell personal stories. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) BARRY JENKINS: We have to give people things not to escape to - there's room for escapism - but things they can run to to reaffirm that - not that all lives matter. I don't want to step into that. But that you know what? If you're feeling something or you want to speak it, you speak it and someone there - will be there to hear your truth. DEL BARCO: But it was precisely an escapist movie, a love letter to Los Angeles and old-fashioned musicals, that swept most of last night's movie categories. \"La La Land\" picked up a record seven Golden Globes. It was dubbed the year's best musical or comedy. (SOUNDBITE OF FILM, \"LA LA LAND\") RYAN GOSLING: (As Sebastian, singing) City of stars, are you shining just for me? DEL BARCO: Singing the year's best original song from the best original score were Golden Globe Award-winning actors Ryan Gosling and Emma Stone. (SOUNDBITE OF FILM, \"LA LA LAND\") EMMA STONE: (As Mia, singing) Never shined so brightly. DEL BARCO: Stone called \"La La Land\" a film for dreamers. Mandalit del Barco, NPR News, Beverly Hills.

            "article_content": "Local leaders in at least 30 states are taking a defiant stance against threats by the incoming Trump administration to deport immigrants living illegally in local communities.  AUDIE CORNISH, HOST: President-elect Donald Trump will take the oath of office in a couple of weeks. We'll hear about some controversy surrounding his inauguration in a moment - first a story about preparations of a different kind. In many cities, local officials are getting ready to defy Trump if he carries through on a campaign pledge to deport millions of people in the U.S. illegally. NPR's Adrian Florido reports. ADRIAN FLORIDO, BYLINE: Days after the election, New York Mayor Bill de Blasio said his city will protect immigrants should Trump try to make good on his promises. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) BILL DE BLASIO: If the federal government wants our police officers to tear immigrant families apart, we will refuse to do it. (APPLAUSE) FLORIDO: In Los Angeles, Mayor Eric Garcetti recently announced a $10 million fund to provide lawyers for immigrants facing deportation. The money will be both public and privately donated. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) ERIC GARCETTI: We don't know how far the new administration will go when it comes to our nation's immigration policy, but we all heard the rhetoric, the dangerous rhetoric, of the election. FLORIDO: Since winning, Donald Trump seems to have backed off of his campaign promise to deport all 11 million immigrants in the country illegally, saying he'll instead focus on immigrants with criminal records. He's also promised to punish cities that don't cooperate. Nonetheless, local leaders in at least 30 states from Arizona to Iowa to Pennsylvania have said they will resist. And their defiance is in turn emboldening grassroots activists. They sense an opportunity to push local leaders further to protect immigrants than they may have been willing to go in the past. At a Mexican restaurant in Durham, N.C. recently, a group of advocates talked strategy over breakfast. VIRIDIANA MARTINEZ: Like, even if he's guilty, why does he have to deal with an ICE hold, you know? FLORIDO: Among them was Viridiana Martinez, a 30-year-old who has lived illegally in this country since she was 7. A few years ago, she was among the activists lobbying for the president to protect young immigrants like her from deportation. He ultimately did that with the DACA program. Something else they've been trying to do for years is convince cities to kick immigration or ICE agents out of local jails, where police often turn people over to ICE custody. MARTINEZ: So this is the thing is, like, how do you break up that collaboration? And, like, the only place that I can think of where that could be pulled off is here. FLORIDO: She thinks this is possible here because of Durham's immigrant-friendly city council which even before Trump won had directed police to make immigration its last priority. Most of Durham's recent population growth is due to immigration, both legal and illegal. Steve Schewel is a councilman. STEVE SCHEWEL: What's more important? Is it more important to use your police resources to try to stop violent crime? Or is it more important to use your resources to enforce draconian immigration rules that you don't even believe in? FLORIDO: He says the city won't know how to respond to Trump until it's clear what the new president is actually going to do. But Schewel says the city will fight back if it has to. SCHEWEL: We are deeply committed to our immigrant population and its safety. FLORIDO: Local activists like Viridiana Martinez already have ideas of what they want the council to do. On the one hand, she says this momentum is exciting. On the other, she says it's frustrating that in many places it seems to have been Trump's election that finally got leaders to take a hard stance. MARTINEZ: Because the reality is we just came out of a presidency where the administration has deported more people than any other. FLORIDO: This is true. By the time President Obama leaves office, it appears his administration will have deported more than 3 million people. Obama often sold himself as a champion of immigrants, acting unilaterally to create the DACA program, for example. But his strategy to gain support for a broader immigration bill also included showing that he could be tough on enforcement. CHRIS NEWMAN: And I think it is just a fact that that bet failed to pay off and also had consequences. FLORIDO: Chris Newman of the National Day Laborer Organizing Network says one of them is that a lot of the local officials now promising to fight Trump's deportation plan did not stand up to Obama's, even though his administration did devastate many immigrant families in their cities. NEWMAN: And he was able to, on a certain level, get away with it as long as people believed that he was also in favor of comprehensive immigration reform. FLORIDO: Now that immigration reform seems less likely than ever, Newman says many local leaders are realizing it may be up to them to defend immigrants. Some cities like LA, New York, Chicago are leading the way. Other cities across the country say they'll develop their own plans in the weeks to come. Adrian Florido, NPR News.

            "article_content": "Congress left town after approving a short-term extension of government funding. Big fights await in 2018, but Senate GOP leader Mitch McConnell tells NPR repealing the ACA is not a high priority.  STEVE INSKEEP, HOST: Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell is ending 2017 with an observation. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED BROADCAST) MITCH MCCONNELL: This has not been a very bipartisan year. Most of our big accomplishments we largely had to do Republicans-only. INSKEEP: Now McConnell is contemplating whether he can operate differently in 2018. The Senate Republican leader spoke with two of our colleagues, Kelsey Snell and Susan Davis. And Sue is in our studios. Good morning. SUSAN DAVIS, BYLINE: Good morning, Steve. INSKEEP: What makes McConnell think about bipartisanship now? DAVIS: Obviously we're heading into an election year, which often focuses the mind of party leaders. INSKEEP: Good moment to seem kind of accommodating, I guess. OK. DAVIS: And he is looking at his majority and looking at the landscape. And I don't think he's interested in provoking the kind of partisan battles that we saw that defined 2017. It's notable because it's a bit in contrast to House Speaker Paul Ryan, who in the closing weeks of the Congress has started to make the argument that Republicans next year should move after their tax cut victory and start looking at federal spending - specifically entitlement programs, aka the third rails of American politics. INSKEEP: Social Security, Medicare. DAVIS: Medicare, Medicaid, social welfare programs. And Mitch McConnell does not share the speaker's enthusiasm. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED BROADCAST) MCCONNELL: I think entitlement changes, to be sustained, almost always have to be bipartisan. And I don't think, you know, one-party-only entitlement changes is something I'm interested in doing. The House may have a different agenda. If our Democratic friends in the Senate want to join us to tackle any kind of entitlement reform, I'd be happy to take a look at it. DAVIS: There's a reason for that. If you look at recent history - even just this year when Republicans tried to change entitlements like Medicaid in the Affordable Care Act fight, when Republicans tried to change Social Security in 2004 - there were political consequences. And he's not trying to repeat that. INSKEEP: He would rather do something bipartisan if he has to do anything at all. There is a potential bipartisan matter on the table having to do with DACA, people brought to this country illegally as children and whether their protections will be extended, which President Trump has at the moment said they'll end. DAVIS: There is some frustration at Democrats that they let Republicans leave town without resolution on immigration. But Republicans and Democrats in the Senate both say there are sincere, good faith negotiations going on to try and reach a comprehensive immigration deal in January. That is one of those areas of bipartisanship that Mitch McConnell referred. Senator Jeff Flake, who is one of the negotiators - he's a Republican from Arizona - said that he has a commitment from the leader to get a vote on immigration legislation in January. And Mitch McConnell has said he will bring it to the floor if these negotiators can come up with something that can get 60 votes. INSKEEP: OK, something potentially bipartisan. Well, if you're Mitch McConnell, and you're thinking about bipartisanship, what do you do about Obamacare? DAVIS: Yeah, so there was a really interesting shift this week at the White House at the signing ceremony for the tax bill where the president was talking about it and said the tax bill also effectively repealed Obamacare because inside of that tax bill they zero out the tax penalty for the individual mandate - bit of a mission-accomplished statement. So we asked Mitch McConnell, do you agree with the president that it's time to move on from health care? And this is what he said. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED BROADCAST) MCCONNELL: We obviously were unable to completely repeal and replace with a 52-48 Senate. We'll have to take a look at what that looks like with a 51-49 Senate, but I think we'll probably move on to other issues. DAVIS: He's, of course, referring to the loss of the seat in Alabama. It also didn't necessarily go over well. Senator Lindsey Graham, a Republican from South Carolina, in response to our interview tweeted out that he's not ready to give up on the effort to repeal and replace Obamacare. But it sounds like the leader's ready to move on. INSKEEP: Well, you mentioned that it's an election year, Sue Davis - or it's going to be an election year in 2018. How much trouble does Mitch McConnell think his party is in? DAVIS: With a 51-49 Senate, I don't think that either party leader can take anything for granted in an election year. The dynamics of the 2018 election in some ways work to Mitch McConnell's advantage simply because Republicans are on offense more than they're on defense. And he talked about 2018 dynamics. Here he is. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED BROADCAST) MCCONNELL: We have a pretty good map - you know, 25 Democrats and only eight Republicans. But I always caution my colleagues don't fall in love with the map because the last cycle there were 24 of us up and only 10 of them. And my colleague Senator Schumer was so confident he was going to have my job. And he called me up the day before the election and said he'd hope we'd have a high-level of cooperation. I called him back the day after the elections - said, I sure hope so. DAVIS: I think the Alabama outcome and having a Democrat win in the South is one of those reminders that you can't take anything for granted in politics and has sort of shaken up this dynamic that thinks that the Republican majority isn't in doubt in 2018. INSKEEP: I'm also thinking of the year 2006 when Republicans also seemed to have profound advantages, but everything fell against them - every single thing, down to the last recount. And they lost the Senate and the House. DAVIS: This is going to be one of the interesting things to watch in 2018 - is you have these dynamics we're looking at - a president with a 38-percent approval rating, Congressional generic polling that shows that Democrats have a double-digit advantage going into the midterms. INSKEEP: Yeah. DAVIS: Those could be signs of a wave coming. But I think there is some hesitance and some caution in this era of Donald Trump, who seems to be rewriting the rules of politics, to say the old rules still apply. The fundamentals of politics may still apply, and it could be a good Democratic year. INSKEEP: NPR's Susan Davis, along with our colleague Kelsey Snell, interviewed Mitch McConnell, the Senate majority leader. And, Sue, thanks for bringing the tape. I really appreciate it. DAVIS: You're welcome. Copyright \u00a9 2017 NPR.  All rights reserved.  Visit our website terms of use and permissions pages at www.npr.org for further information.

            "article_content": "President Trump's latest fight with GOP members threatens to jeopardize his legislative plans. We examine how the schism may effect lawmakers trying to push through deep tax cuts.  RACHEL MARTIN, HOST: Since his inauguration, President Trump has made it clear that he is not going to toe the party line. He's bucked the GOP time and again, often personally lambasting lawmakers who he thinks have slighted him in some way or whom he sees as standing in the way of his agenda. Most of the time, the lawmaker in question appears to let it roll off, choosing not to intentionally inflame an already combustible relationship. Not so with Bob Corker. The Republican senator from Tennessee has set off a remarkable war of words with the president. Corker recently announced he's not running for re-election, so he doesn't have a whole lot to lose. The question now is to what degree this whole thing could further damage the president's interactions with Congress and his legislative agenda. NPR's Tamara Keith covers the White House. She's going to talk us through that question and a whole lot more. Hi, Tam. TAMARA KEITH, BYLINE: Hey. MARTIN: Corker is a big deal in Congress. He's a very senior, well-respected member. Are his comments having an effect? I mean, this is a moment where the president desperately needs a legislative win and he wants that to be his tax plan. KEITH: Right. And here's the thing with Bob Corker. Before he was in a war of words with the president, he was expressing serious concerns about the tax proposal that came from the White House and top Republicans saying that he was concerned about the effect it would have on the deficit. Why does that matter? Yes, Bob Corker is a senior respected Republican chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. But he is also one of 52 Republicans in the Senate. It is a very narrow majority. And any senator gets a whole lot of power when the majority is that narrow. Corker's raising concerns about the tax legislation. There are other senators who are likely not to support it. And so that means, like, maybe you shouldn't poke people in the eye. MARTIN: So the president has been on Twitter this morning. And he's put out something I want to run past you. Here's the tweets. It says as follows - (reading) since Congress can't get its act together on health care, I will be using the power of the pen to give great health care to many people fast. What does that mean? KEITH: The president is widely expected later this week to sign an executive order that would allow people to buy into what's known as association health plans or allow more people to buy into them. It would relax rules for those plans. We don't have a lot of details or really any details at this point, but some insurance commissioners oppose this idea because it would limit their ability to regulate plans. Health care advocates say it could undermine the Obamacare insurance marketplaces. Advocates say that it would put more cheaper options out there for people. And as with many things related to executive action, expect legal challenges. MARTIN: Right. And the bigger picture is just illustrating the fact that he's having such a difficult time with a Congress led by his own party, which is why, in some ways, it makes sense that he is perhaps reaching out to the other side, to Democrats, who he made an overture towards on immigration. He made this kind of soft deal with Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer a couple weeks ago about the so-called dreamers. Now that's up in the air, though. What can you tell us? KEITH: Yeah, that soft deal seems to have softened considerably. President Trump tweeting this morning or in a statement on Twitter saying the problem with agreeing to a policy on immigration is that the Democrats don't want secure borders, and they don't care about safety for the USA. The White House released a series of principles for immigration. Democrats say it's a nonstarter. President Trump has said that he wants a fix for DACA. That's the program for young people who are undocumented immigrants who came to the U.S. as children. But Democrats want that too. However, the conditions the president is putting on it, Democrats are not going for. MARTIN: All right, NPR's Tamara Keith breaking it down for us this morning. Thanks so much, Tam. KEITH: You're welcome. Copyright \u00a9 2017 NPR.  All rights reserved.  Visit our website terms of use and permissions pages at www.npr.org for further information.

            "article_content": "Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell talked with NPR about his legislative agenda for 2018. Also, Jonathan O'Connell of The Washington Post discusses a dismissed lawsuit against President Trump.  STEVE INSKEEP, HOST: Mitch McConnell, the Senate majority leader, is ending the year on a rather thoughtful note. RACHEL MARTIN, HOST: He's coming off a rather productive week. Republicans passed their tax overhaul bill, and Congress averted a government shutdown. None of this stopped McConnell from expressing some regrets though in an interview with NPR. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED BROADCAST) MITCH MCCONNELL: This has not been a very bipartisan year. Most of our big accomplishments we largely had to do Republicans-only. MARTIN: McConnell says he would like to see 2018 be more bipartisan. INSKEEP: He was talking with two NPR correspondents, Kelsey Snell and Susan Davis. And Sue is here in our studios. Good morning, Sue. SUSAN DAVIS, BYLINE: Good morning. INSKEEP: What would prompt Mitch McConnell, partisan warrior, to talk about working with the other side? DAVIS: A little bit of political reality - most likely in an election year. There is a push among some Republicans, since coming off this high of their tax cut victory, to focus on the other Republican priority of entitlement reform - or looking at mandatory federal spending programs. House Speaker Paul Ryan says he'd like to look at social welfare programs, and Mitch McConnell said he doesn't really share that enthusiasm. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED BROADCAST) MCCONNELL: I think entitlement changes, to be sustained, almost always have to be bipartisan. And I don't think, you know, one-party-only entitlement changes is something I'm interested in doing. The House may have a different agenda. If our Democratic friends in the Senate want to join us to tackle any kind of entitlement reform, I'd be happy to take a look at it. DAVIS: Democrats, of course, have reason to maybe be a little bit cynical about Mitch McConnell's interest in bipartisanship. As he said, it has been a very bipartisan - very partisan year. INSKEEP: Yeah. DAVIS: But, you know, he has some incentive to work with Democrats next year too. INSKEEP: Well, you hear him saying why he would want to be bipartisan. It's the only way they can get the next things done because of the way the Senate works. Is there a bipartisan solution on the horizon for DACA, the program having to do with kids brought to this country illegally as children? DAVIS: That is one of the potentially best examples of a way that they could get a bipartisan solution next year. There are very sincere, by all accounts, talks going on in the Senate between Democrats and Republicans about a comprehensive immigration bill. Senate - Senator Jeff Flake of Arizona says he has a commitment from Mitch McConnell to get a vote in January. And Mitch McConnell says he will bring a bill to the floor if this group of negotiators can prove it can get 60 votes. INSKEEP: Did you get a sense in your conversation with Mitch McConnell how much trouble he thinks his party is in in the 2018 election? DAVIS: You know, Republicans were feeling pretty good. But I think the loss in Alabama sent a reminder that you can never be too confident about your prospects, even in states where you are always pretty inclined to win. He says his message to Republicans is don't fall in love with the map. Obviously, it's a very narrow Senate right now. INSKEEP: Yeah. DAVIS: It's a 51-49 Senate. Democrats do potentially have a path to a majority, so I think he's trying to scare his Republican colleagues into running hard. But the math still does work in Republicans' favor. INSKEEP: Can I just ask? Mitch McConnell's a figure that gets criticized a lot on the right... DAVIS: Yeah. INSKEEP: ...Gets despised on the left. But what's it actually like to talk with this guy in the Senate - in this institution that he seems to love so much? DAVIS: He's a very deliberative person. He doesn't really tend to say anything by accident. He's not highly emotional or prone to engaging in sort of tit for tats. He also made a little bit of news as well where he said, like President Trump said at the White House on Thursday, he's kind of ready to move on from health care - that he's not as interested in trying to go to the full repeal-and-replace effort over the Affordable Care Act next year. So that was one more nod at maybe his effort to be a little bit more bipartisan. INSKEEP: Not so much of an ideologue as he sometimes seems. Sue, thanks very much. DAVIS: You're welcome. INSKEEP: That's NPR's Susan Davis. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) INSKEEP: OK, President Trump said he wanted a tax bill by Christmas. And now he heads into the holiday weekend with that on his desk and also another - we enter something which could be described as a win. MARTIN: Right, this was in the courts. Yesterday, a federal judge dismissed this lawsuit that had to do with President Trump's properties and business holdings, like his hotel right here in Washington, D.C. The judge declined to hear arguments that the president's business activity violates the Constitution. INSKEEP: And that is the department of The Washington Post's Jonathan O'Connell, who's come by our studios. Good morning, sir. JONATHAN O'CONNELL: Good morning. INSKEEP: Would you remind us why was it that a watchdog group was suing here? What is the constitutional provision at issue? O'CONNELL: Sure, it's a sort of obscure provision called the Emoluments Clause. It essentially prevents the president from accepting payments or compensation from foreign governments. So it was originally created to prevent, you know, taking sort of like little bribes and gifts from foreign kings, etc. And now, Mr. Trump because he is - still owns his company, and his hotel still rents space to foreign governments - embassies, diplomats, etc. - that's sort of the entry point for this good-government group and other plaintiffs to say, you are violating the Constitution's Emoluments Clause. This has never been argued in the courts before. So it's really kind of - it's un-walked territory legally. And everyone's trying to figure out exactly what you can and cannot do. INSKEEP: Why was the suit dismissed? O'CONNELL: Well, the judge basically said, this isn't something for me to decide. Congress should be deciding whether or not the president is accepting emoluments - whether that is OK or not. Congress should say what he should and can and cannot accept. So by the judge's ruling, it's up to Congress to decide whether these groups the president has taken at his hotel should be doing that or not. INSKEEP: Wait. Let me make sure I understand this. And I had heard that there was a big question about what's known as standing. Did this group CREW have standing? Did they have status to actually sue? And the judge said no. But you're saying the judge said something more. Essentially nobody has standing, according to this judge, to sue. This just doesn't belong in the courts at all. O'CONNELL: Well, certainly none of the plaintiffs in this case. It's hard - there are other cases out there. So for instance, the attorneys general in D.C. and Maryland have both brought a suit. And the hearing on that is in January. So they are going to argue that they have standing because they've been - their states or jurisdictions have been damaged separately. INSKEEP: You have to find that you've been harmed - you have to show that you've been harmed in order to sue. O'CONNELL: Exactly. INSKEEP: With that said, did the judge comment at all, in any way, on the underlying merits of being president of the United States and owning a hotel where members of foreign governments are buying high-priced rooms and owning other businesses in various other countries? O'CONNELL: He did not. And that's sort of the glimpse of hope for the other cases that are out there, in terms of other people who have sued the president over this - is that the underlying discussion about emoluments really didn't take place here. Even though it was a very prominent suit, and the attorneys working on the case for the plaintiffs were really very accomplished, and there were lots of different arguments in there, none of them were really addressed. INSKEEP: Do you have any sense about whether the public particularly cares at this point that the president... O'CONNELL: (Laughter). INSKEEP: No, seriously, whether this is something that really bothers the public at large - that the president has these businesses. MARTIN: You're laughing, so I guess no. O'CONNELL: I appreciate all the interest in the term emoluments and people learning about it. I think to this point people are sometimes bothered by what the president does with his businesses. And to the degree that it bothers them, they should tell their congressman at this point. INSKEEP: Oh, because this is - according to the judge, it's a political issue. O'CONNELL: Right. INSKEEP: Jonathan, thanks for coming by. Jonathan OConnell of The Washington Post. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) INSKEEP: OK, yesterday, the Trump administration was shamed diplomatically at the United Nations. The General Assembly overwhelmingly voted to reject President Trump's decision to recognize Jerusalem as the capital of Israel. MARTIN: President Trump talked of cutting off aid to countries that voted in favor of that U.N. resolution, but he was defied by nearly every other country in the world, including U.S. allies like Afghanistan and Pakistan. Pakistan was actually a co-sponsor of that U.N. resolution. And Pakistan gets hundreds of millions of dollars in U.S. aid. So does the U.S. make good on this threat? INSKEEP: Let's ask NPR's Diaa Hadid, who's on the line from Islamabad, Pakistan's capital. Welcome back. DIAA HADID, BYLINE: Hello, there. Good morning. INSKEEP: What prompted Pakistan not just to vote against the United States but to take a leading role here? HADID: Right, well, the first reason is religious. Jerusalem is holy to Jews, Christians and Muslims. And for Muslims, it's the site of the third holiest shrine. That's not something that Pakistan is going to be seen as giving up so easily. And there's a broad consensus among Muslim-majority countries that Palestinians should have some sort of sovereignty there. And so I spoke to the foreign ministry spokesperson this morning, you know, who said as much. His name is Faisal Khan (ph). INSKEEP: Let's listen. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) FORIEGN MINISTRY SPOKESPERSON FAISAL KHAN: Pakistan and the people living here are majorities Muslims, and they have always espoused the cause of - causes of Muslim Ummah. And Jerusalem is one of the principal causes. INSKEEP: Well, I'm curious about this, Diaa, because it was said that President Trump's move recognizing Jerusalem was partly domestic. It was about domestic politics here in the United States. Is there a domestic political aspect to Pakistan pushing back so hard? HADID: Absolutely, and what analysts here say is that a part of this - especially the co-sponsoring of this bill - was to play to a domestic audience ahead of general elections that are expected in the next few months. One of the key voting groups that this government has to appeal to are right-wing religious voters, and this is a way of showing how forceful they can be on this issue. INSKEEP: I guess they also - I guess they also get to demonstrate that they're standing up to the United States. HADID: Oh, absolutely. This was - what do you guys call this? - like a really easy shot. This was just a really... INSKEEP: A slam-dunk is what... HADID: It was a slam-dunk (laughter). INSKEEP: ...George Tenet, the CIA director, once would have said. But go on. Go on. HADID: It's a slam-dunk. It's a really well-timed poke in the eye because, you know, relations between Pakistan and the United States have been tense. But right now, there's a sense that they've been worsening under the Trump administration. Just consider this - that the - Mike Pence made a surprise visit to Kabul yesterday, and this is what he said. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) VICE PRESIDENT MIKE PENCE: You know, for too long, Pakistan has provided safe haven to the Taliban and many terrorist organizations. But those days are over. HADID: OK, and so... INSKEEP: OK, all right, go on. HADID: You - I mean, those are long-standing accusations which Pakistan denies. But it's that sense of castigation that Pakistan is really resenting right now. INSKEEP: And there were... HADID: So this was a really easy chance to... INSKEEP: To push back on. HADID: ...Show America that it won't stand up to this sort of - that it will stand up to this sort of bullying. INSKEEP: Diaa, thanks very much. HADID: Thank you. INSKEEP: NPR's Diaa Hadid.

            "article_content": "President Trump rattled members of his own party when he sat at the White House with leaders from both parties. In a deal to keep the government running, he sided with Democrats.  RACHEL MARTIN, HOST: The art of the deal apparently includes a heavy dose of surprise. President Donald Trump rattled members of his own party when he sat in the Oval Office yesterday with leaders from both parties. And in a deal to keep the government running, he sided with Democrats. NPR national political correspondent Mara Liasson joins me now. Mara, what happened here? MARA LIASSON, BYLINE: What happened was the president had the Republican and Democratic leadership over to the White House to talk about what they were going to do about these difficult issues, and Democrats made him an offer. They said, we'll fund Harvey; we'll give you a three-month extension on the debt ceiling and a three-month measure to keep the government running until mid-December. This is something that the Republicans didn't want. Earlier in the day, Paul Ryan had called this three-month deal ridiculous and disgraceful. Republicans wanted a much longer debt limit extension because they didn't want their members to have to vote for this unpopular measure more than once before the next election. But the next thing, you know, the president who wrote \"The Art Of The Deal\" said to the Democrats, you've got a deal. And here's how he described it later in the day when he was in North Dakota at an event, pushing his tax overhaul. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: We had a great meeting with Chuck Schumer, Nancy Pelosi and the whole Republican leadership group. And I'll tell you what, we walked out of there - Mitch, and Paul and everybody - Kevin - and we walked out, and everybody was happy - not too happy because you can never be too happy. LIASSON: Republicans were not too happy at all because, don't forget, this deal with Democrats comes after weeks of the president criticizing and scolding members of his own party, including the Senate majority leader, Mitch McConnell. So I can't imagine that this is going to make relations between the president and his party any better. MARTIN: Yeah, so given that, how are Republicans responding to this? LIASSON: Well, I think their range of emotions goes from shock to anger. Yesterday, Congressman Kevin Cramer, who's the North Dakota Republican who was traveling with the president, talked to us on Air Force One. Here's what he said. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) KEVIN CRAMER: I will tell you that I gasped when I heard it. In fact, I sought clarification when the president told us that before the flight, actually. LIASSON: Cramer went on to say that he trusts the president's negotiating ability; he probably felt this was the best deal he could get. But, he said, it's going to be an extremely tough sell in our conference because nobody wanted this or expected it on the Republican side. MARTIN: I mean, this is what a lot of so-called establishment Republicans during the election and the campaign had warned of. They weren't convinced that Donald Trump would be loyal to the GOP. So in - when you look at this, what - why did he do this? Why - I mean, why did he opt to go with Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer, people he has maligned in the past? LIASSON: Well, there's two schools of thought. Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin was on the plane yesterday, and he tried to make the case that the president did this because he wanted a chance to come back in December to get more military spending on the government funding bill. That could be true, or that could be spin. The other school of thought is that the president is impulsive. He wanted a deal. He didn't care very much who it was with or what the details were, and he just wasn't very happy with Republican leaders. MARTIN: What does this mean for the president's decision or non-decision on DACA, and also for the plans he has for tax cuts? LIASSON: Well, Republicans feel this decision, this three-month deal, means that the president has given Democrats a lot of leverage over the debate over DACA and even tax reform. The president has already said he wants a legislative fix for DACA. He wants to turn to President Obama's executive action into legislation. And here's what he said about that yesterday. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) TRUMP: Chuck and Nancy would like to see something happen, and so do I. And I said, if we can get something to happen, we're going to sign it, and we're going to make it or - make a lot of happy people. LIASSON: So again, Chuck and Nancy - he didn't really mention the Republicans there. In reality, he and the Republicans don't want to just do a simple DACA fix. They also want border security too. But this does mean that Democrats are going to have a lot more leverage on DACA, especially if they try to pass it to any - try to attach it to any of these must-pass measures that are now going to come up again in December. On taxes, administration officials say this just puts more pressure on them to get the tax bill done before mid-December because now they have a much shorter window before they have to revisit these other issues like the debt ceiling and government funding. MARTIN: Meanwhile, in the backdrop, the Russia investigations are rolling along. And there has been a new revelation from Facebook about selling ads to Russian-interest groups aligned with Russian interests in the 2016 election. What can you tell us about that? LIASSON: That's right. This is something that the investigatory committees on Capitol Hill are very interested in. It turns out that Facebook sold ads to Russian interests. The big question is, when the Russian interests bought these ads, how did they know which Facebook feeds to put them in? How did they know which voters to target them to? So they're interested in finding out if there was any kind of coordination or assistance from any American interests, like the Trump campaign, telling these Russians where and how to target these ads - what algorithms to use, for instance. And that's what - that is the new line of inquiry on Capitol Hill. MARTIN: And speaking of Capitol Hill - more testimony expected to happen there on the Russia investigations today. LIASSON: More testimony expected to happen - Donald Trump Jr. is going to be interviewed today behind closed doors by Senate Judiciary Committee staff members. They're interested in talking to him because of his involvement in setting up that June 2016 meeting at Trump Tower with a Russian lawyer. So the Russia investigation continues as all of this other stuff is roiling the relationship between the president and his own party on Capitol Hill. MARTIN: Lots of stuff. NPR's Mara Liasson - thanks so much, Mara. LIASSON: Thank you. Copyright \u00a9 2017 NPR.  All rights reserved.

            "article_content": "President Trump and congressional leaders will meet on Tuesday to try and hammer out a deal to fund the government and work on end-of-year legislation. The president will also head to Capitol Hill to rally Republicans around a tax overhaul.  KELLY MCEVERS, HOST: Now that Thanksgiving break is over, members of Congress are back in Washington and hoping to overhaul the tax code before Christmas. That means the Senate needs to pass a bill this week to stay on the timetable. And on top of that, Congress also has to pass a bill to fund the government by next Friday to avoid a shutdown. Tracking all of this is NPR congressional reporter Scott Detrow, and he's with us now. Hey, Scott. SCOTT DETROW, BYLINE: Hey, Kelly. MCEVERS: All right, so this sounds like a pretty tight timeline. Let's just cut to the chase. Is this Republican tax bill going to pass in this timeframe or not? DETROW: So at the moment, Republicans are feeling very confident. Here's Pennsylvania Republican Pat Toomey earlier today. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) PAT TOOMEY: I am confident that we're going to get this done soon, get it to the president's desk. And the president is eagerly looking forward to signing it. DETROW: But you know, the story of 2017 in Congress is Republicans' narrow margin in the Senate. Just a couple defections could tank the whole thing. So a couple of people to keep an eye on - Bob Corker of Tennessee and Jeff Flake of Arizona. They are two Republican voices who have been very critical of President Trump and coincidentally have said they're not running for re-election. Both have said they have major concerns about how this tax bill will increase the deficit. And if they're both noes, Republicans can't lose any other votes. One piece of good news for Republican leaders today was that Rand Paul of Kentucky, who is often a holdout who doesn't like to compromise much, has said he is supporting this bill. MCEVERS: All right. So Republicans have some work before the Senate can actually vote on the bill, right? And yet the parties say they do want to vote this week. How is that going to happen? DETROW: It's going to be a busy week. We'll have a sense of what happens when tomorrow when President Trump visits Capitol Hill to talk to Senate Republicans to lay out the timeline. But if they want to vote by the end of the week, they'll need to begin the procedural process very early. You're going to see a lot of late nights in the Senate with amendments being offered. And given the concerns of Flake and Corker and a couple other Republicans, we'll likely see some changes to this. Now, the reason they need to move fast and want to move fast is there are still more steps even after the Senate approves this. Because the Senate and House will have passed different versions, they're going to need two to hash out an agreement and then both vote on it again. MCEVERS: And the tax bill of course isn't the only thing they're working on, as we said. Give us a quick rundown of what else is on their plate. DETROW: This could fill up the rest of the program (laughter), but I'll keep it short and do the highlights. The Children's Health Insurance Program has already ran - run out of money. That expired in September. States have been using creative budgeting to keep that going, but many states are starting to hit a deadline. And 9 million children get health insurance through CHIP. Some of them might run out of coverage very soon if Congress doesn't do something. There's a law authorizing foreign electronic surveillance that expires. President Trump has asked for about $44 million in additional emergency funding for hurricane and wildfire recovery. And, oh, by the way, government funding expires at the end of next week, December 8. MCEVERS: Oh, that... DETROW: Yeah. MCEVERS: (Laughter) That's a big thing on the to-do list, I would think. DETROW: Just a little. MCEVERS: So does that mean all these other things that you mentioned including the tax bill would have to be tabled for a while if Congress can't go forward with funding the government? DETROW: Yeah, and I think tomorrow could give us a good idea of whether this is going to be a month talking about brinksmanship of a shutdown or whether they can get this hashed out pretty quickly. President Trump is meeting at the White House with Republican and Democratic congressional leaders. And if you remember back to September, Trump surprised everyone by very quickly reaching a deal with Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer to fund the government for several months. So maybe he'll reach a quick deal with them again. Of course last time around, his Republican allies were frustrated that he gave a lot of leverage to Democrats, which Democrats may be prepared to use right now. It'll be interesting to watch whether Pelosi and Schumer say, hey, we'll vote for government funding if you stabilize Obamacare markets or if you, among other things, put some sort of permanent fix in place for DACA, the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program. MCEVERS: That's NPR congressional reporter Scott Detrow. Thank you. DETROW: Thank you. Copyright \u00a9 2017 NPR.  All rights reserved.

            "article_content": "We review President Trump's impromptu interview with The New York Times and look ahead to his upcoming battles with congressional Democrats.  LINDA WERTHEIMER, HOST: He regularly blasts it as the failing New York Times, but President Trump could not resist an impromptu, sit-down interview with one of its reporters. NPR's senior Washington editor and correspondent Ron Elving joins me now to offer some insight on to what that interview revealed and what battles the president will be fighting in the New Year. Hello, Ron. RON ELVING, BYLINE: Always good to hear your voice, Linda. WERTHEIMER: Thank you. The president constantly lumps the Times in with other media outlets he perceives to be critical of him as fake news. So why does Times reporter Michael Schmidt get so much of his time? ELVING: This was something of an accidental interview. It wasn't on anybody's schedule, but it just happened because Schmidt had been invited down there by a Trump confidant who set it up. The president, after all, let's remember, is a born New Yorker. He's a longtime Manhattanite. So his personality kind of needs the oxygen of The New York Times every day. He does read a lot of other things for affirmation or to gauge public sentiment and information, but he still looks to the Times to gauge his own stature. It's important to be in the paper, to be on page one. And when he is, he is affirmed. He is the most important person in the world. WERTHEIMER: Well, what was the takeaway for you from that interview? ELVING: You know, it was full of potential quotations and news bits. This is what the president does. As a media star, he dominates the daily news cycle. But you had to be struck by his repeated self-exoneration in the probe of Russian election interference about every other minute in this interview. Literally 16 times by several people's count in a 30-minute interview, he said there was, quote, \"no collusion,\" unquote - the same words over and over - no collusion between his campaign and the interfering Russians. Just an assertion. He just repeated it. He never gave any evidence to that effect. This is a kind of ad technique - repeating a phrase like lowest prices or free shipping. And there's also that line from Shakespeare, if I may paraphrase, doth the gentleman protest too much? WERTHEIMER: (Laughter) Now, Ron, the president and the Congress are facing a deadline to get a budget deal done two weeks from now and to avoid a government shutdown. The measure that passed before Christmas was a stopgap. What do you think the chances are that the government will shut down? ELVING: Well, we may get another stopgap. That's what usually happens. And we should probably avoid a shutdown in any event because it really isn't necessary. And neither party sees a shutdown as a big help going into an election year. But there really are sticking points, too, between the parties and between the factions of the Republican Party, which has been the problem leading up to this point. They are, of course, the majority in Congress in both chambers. And one big issue, too, between the president and Democrats in trying to get cooperation from the minority party is that we have the question of the DREAMers, the young people who grew up in this country after being brought here illegally by their undocumented parents. What's going to happen to them? And there's talk of a deal by which they would be allowed to stay in exchange for the Democrats caving in on financing the president's wall on the Mexican border. But up to now, the Democrats have said, no way. So we'll be watching that one. WERTHEIMER: The president's also talked about an infrastructure bill - not the wall, but more in the sort of roads and bridges line - to come to Congress in the New Year. Is there any chance of the Democrats buying into that? ELVING: A funny thing happened on the way to the construction site. The trillion-dollar national investment in infrastructure that the president talked about in the 2016 campaign has now become a $200 billion - that's one-fifth as much - bill and talk of about what may come next. And this is not official yet, but this is what people are talking about. And that much smaller amount would be aimed at encouraging private construction, which would, of course, involve private profit making. And here, again, that is not likely to get much Democratic support. WERTHEIMER: Before I let you go, what about Roy Moore, the unsuccessful Republican candidate for Senate from Alabama? The state certified the Democrat Doug Jones as its new senator. Does that mean we've seen the last of Roy Moore? ELVING: That would seem to be the way to bet. He really got snubbed by party officials in his attempts to claim voter fraud in that special election. So this would seem to be the end of the line. We don't expect them to get anything from a very disappointed President Trump. And if I may be allowed to quote the line that the judge himself closed with, \"to God be the glory.\" WERTHEIMER: NPR's senior Washington editor, correspondent Ron Elving. Happy New Year, Ron.

            "article_content": "The Republican overhaul of the tax code overcame hurdles to pass the Senate and includes some changes average Americans may feel come tax time, should it make it to the president's desk.  SCOTT SIMON, HOST: Congressional Republicans are a step closer to passing a $1.5 trillion tax cut. The Senate passed its version overnight with all but one of 52 Republican senators voting yes. Republican leaders now hope to harmonize that Senate bill with the House version then bring it to the president for signature. NPR's Scott Horsley joins us now. Good morning, Scott. SCOTT HORSLEY, BYLINE: Good morning. SIMON: I have to ask first - this is an almost 500-page bill that wasn't ready until a couple of hours before they voted. Did senators read it? HORSLEY: (Laughter) I can tell you our Hill colleague Kelsey Snell was making a heroic effort to read it. She's got a great summary at npr.org, which is time-stamped several hours after the vote - 1:49 a.m. I don't know if the lawmakers got through it. We're all going to be digging into the weeds. SIMON: There were some senators who complained. There were a lot of senators who complained they couldn't - didn't have a chance to read it. HORSLEY: That's right, although Republican leader Mitch McConnell says you complain about the process when you don't have the votes. SIMON: And what sort of accommodations did he make to get this bill done? HORSLEY: There were a number. Ron Johnson of Wisconsin had been concerned that so-called pass-through businesses were not getting enough in the tax cuts, so that was sweetened. Susan Collins of Maine was won over with the addition of a tax deduction for local property taxes. Senator Jeff Flake of Arizona set aside his concerns about the trillion dollars in red ink in this bill in exchange for a rather vague assurance that something will be done on DACA - that some kind of relief will be offered for undocumented immigrants who were brought to the country as children. SIMON: And with the exception of the no vote from Senator Corker of Tennessee - we'll note for the umpteenth time is not up for re-election - this was a vote that was strictly along party lines. Why no bipartisan interchange, as there so often is on tax bills? HORSLEY: Well, the Democrats don't like this for a number of reasons - one, that it balloons the deficit. Even though there were assurances from the GOP that these tax cuts would pay for themselves, the congressional scorekeepers say that's not the case. Many Democrats were warning on the Senate floor that the GOP will use rising deficits as an excuse to call for cuts to popular entitlement programs. The other big complaint from Democrats, though, is that even though it was marketed as a middle-class tax cut, most of the savings actually go to people at the top of the income ladder. That's especially true in the later years because while the individual tax cuts in the bill are temporary, the corporate tax cuts are permanent. And the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center estimates, by 2027, more than 60 percent of the savings go to the upper 1 percent - that is people making more than $900,000. SIMON: And what are the differences between the House and Senate versions that would have to be worked out if a tax bill actually goes to the president's desk for signature? HORSLEY: Well, that is going to be a project in the coming days. Most of the last-minute jockeying on the Senate side moved the Senate bill closer to the House version. For example, Republicans did not include the kind of automatic deficit trigger that Senator Corker was pushing for that might have been a deal-breaker in the House. The Senate bill takes a whack at Obamacare. It does away with the penalty for people who don't buy health insurance. That probably won't be a hard sell in the House. Assuming that provision survives, by the way, congressional forecasters say it would boost Obamacare premiums by about 10 percent and leave 13 million more Americans without health insurance. Another thing that people might want to pay attention to in the coming days as this harmonization process takes place - if you live in a pricey housing market, the House bill cuts the deduction for mortgage interest - caps it at half a million dollars. The Senate bill leaves that untouched. So that is a possible difference that people might want to pay attention to. SIMON: NPR's Scott Horsley, thanks so much for being with us and covering this story at all hours. We're grateful. HORSLEY: (Laughter) Good to be with you. Copyright \u00a9 2017 NPR.

            "article_content": "Congress returns after a holiday recess. Sexual harassment dominates the political conversation. President Trump meets with key Republican senators on Monday to try to steer the GOP agenda.  RACHEL MARTIN, HOST: Congress is back in session today. Sexual harassment is still dominating the political conversation. And President Trump is meeting with key Republican senators this afternoon to get the agenda back on track. Can they, though? Here with more is NPR's national political correspondent Mara Liasson. Good morning, Mara. MARA LIASSON, BYLINE: Hi, Rachel. MARTIN: Let's get to taxes. Are we expecting the Senate to pass a tax overhaul bill this week or not? LIASSON: Republicans certainly would like to. There are still, however, a handful of holdouts, and they can only afford to lose two Republicans since they're not going to get any Democratic votes on this. It's an unpopular bill. The Republicans are still trying to convince voters that it's actually a middle-class tax bill, and the reason they're having a problem on that is because the corporate taxes are permanent. The corporate tax cuts are permanent, and the individual tax cuts expire. But this is a must-pass piece of legislation for Republicans because they don't have any other big pieces of legislation to put on their record, and donors have been putting them on notice that they better pass this. MARTIN: So where's the common ground going to come from? Because it seems like Republicans - those who are dissenting against this bill - they all have slightly different reasons. LIASSON: Yes, there're a lot of moving parts here. Some Republicans are concerned about the way small businesses are treated in this bill, as opposed to big corporations. There also are a - is a small handful of deficit hawks who have objections. This bill balloons the deficit at a time when the deficits are already dangerously large. And among those deficit hawks happened to be the president's main antagonists in the Senate, like Senator Bob Corker, and John McCain and Jeff Flake, none of whom are up for re-election, so they're a lot freer to vote their conscience. MARTIN: We also happen to be less than two weeks out from the deadline to prevent a government shutdown. Are we really at this point again? Are we really going to have to... LIASSON: Yes, we are. MARTIN: ...Go over the edge of the fiscal cliff, the dreaded fiscal cliff? LIASSON: (Laughter) Yes, we really are at this point again, and there are so many issues involved in this government shutdown negotiations. Defense spending is one. Republicans want more defense spending, but Democrats - and this is a bill where you will need Democratic votes - say they want an equal amount of domestic spending. Then there's DACA. Remember the DREAMers, those young people who - many of whom brought here illegally as children by their parents. The president gave Congress until March to legalize the DREAMers before he ends their protection from deportation. But many Democrats are saying they don't want to vote to keep the government funded unless there's a fix for DACA now. So that's a lot of things to resolve in the next two weeks. MARTIN: Right. And amidst all of it are these allegations of sexual harassment in Congress, which you say is particularly difficult for Democrats in this moment. LIASSON: Yes, that's true. Democrats are struggling to win the high ground on sexual harassment. John Conyers, who is being investigated for a sexual harassment claim, has stepped down from his position as the ranking member on the Judiciary Committee. He has already gone through one sexual harassment investigation, which ended up in a settlement to a former employee. Then you've got Minnesota Senator Al Franken, who, unlike John Conyers or the president or Roy Moore, has admitted kissing a woman, said he was ashamed. He's apologized. So if Democrats are going to maintain the high ground on this issue, they have to figure out, what is the criteria for ending your career? What's the bar that says you should no longer be in Congress? What's the process for people who deny the accusations against them? This is really important for Democrats because they want to be the party of zero tolerance on sexual harassment, the party that believes women, and they want to paint the Republicans as the party that says women are liars. MARTIN: Meanwhile, President Trump - he's evolved on the - on Roy Moore, the Alabama Senate candidate. First, he was kind of - he was equivocating, and now he's just outright saying, yeah, this - I support this guy; he's the person Alabama voters should elect. LIASSON: That's right. He says he supports him. He points out that Roy Moore denies the accusations against him. This is similar to Donald Trump's own approach to the dozen or so women who've accused him of sexual harassment. He has called them liars. So he has been tweeting that we shouldn't let Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer win this seat. But even if Roy Moore does win the special election on December 12, the Republicans' headaches are just beginning because Moore will face an ethics investigation, and there're a number of Republicans in the Senate who think he should be expelled. MARTIN: That would make Mitch McConnell's life difficult, to say the least, if Roy Moore were elected. LIASSON: Yes, more difficult than it already is. MARTIN: More difficult - I got that pun. All right, Mara Liasson, NPR's national political correspondent - thanks, Mara. LIASSON: Thank you. Copyright \u00a9 2017 NPR.  All rights reserved.

            "article_content": "From congressmen announcing their resignations to the federal government averting shutdown, the week in politics has felt more like months.  SCOTT SIMON, HOST: Resignations fly from Capitol Hill, the federal government keeps the lights on - for a couple of weeks - votes will soon be cast in Alabama, the deputy national security adviser steps down, House and Senate Republicans try to hammer out a tax bill and reaction to President Trump's formal recognition of Jerusalem as the capital of Israel. NPR's Ron Elving joins us now. Ron, thanks so much for being with us. RON ELVING, BYLINE: Good morning, Scott. SIMON: Let's get to the resignations first. Senator Al Franken, subject of accusations of misconduct by at least eight women, went to the Senate floor and said, quote, \"some of the allegations against me are simply not true. Others I remember very differently.\" But he said he'll resign anyway and added it's ironic he leaves while Roy Moore, who has been accused of forcing himself on teenage girls, and President Trump are not stepping down. Did Democrats force Franken to resign? And does this characterize a difference in the two parties? ELVING: In effect, yes, Scott. About half the Democrats in the Senate had publicly called on Franken to step down, including nearly all the women. And it was clear these charges were just too toxic for him to continue. You ask about the two parties, and contrast could not be more stark with what's happening in Alabama. SIMON: What more do we know about some of the other cases, John Conyers of Michigan and Republican Trent Franks of Arizona who's resigned. ELVING: They have resigned, effective immediately, and they are gone. John Conyers, of course, was a octogenarian icon of the civil rights movement who was the longest-serving member of the House but also rather notorious for his behavior toward women around the Capitol. Trent Franks was a Tea Party Republican from Arizona who apparently asked a couple of women in his office if they would be willing to be surrogate mothers for himself and his wife. SIMON: Offered $5 million, according to reports. ELVING: Yes, that is a rather impressive figure. He made his money with his own oil and gas exploration company a number of years ago. SIMON: Roy Moore faces Democrat Doug Jones in the special Alabama Senate seat election on Tuesday. You can choose your poll. Roy Moore leads in some, Doug Jones in a few others. Roy Moore has that ranking despite public and compelling allegations of sexual misconduct and creepy behavior with teenage girls. I mean, he was reportedly banned from entering certain shopping malls. How do you see this race playing out? ELVING: Polls differ, but they are all close. And that would tend to indicate that Roy Moore has weathered the storm, which may qualify as something of a miracle. But he has cast doubt on his accusers. And mostly, he's cast doubt on his opponent Doug Jones, calling him an advocate for abortion and calling him a puppet of the national Democrats. Those are two pretty serious accusations in the state of Alabama. SIMON: Federal government is in business for at least another couple of weeks. What about thereafter? ELVING: Well, thereafter, we may be singing Christmas carols in the Capitol. It's brinksmanship, of course. They're just trying to get everybody focused and trying to get everybody to actually vote for the basic spending bills, get Congress to do their routine business. It's not routine, though, because Republican leaders can't get enough of their members to vote for spending bills. So they need Democratic votes to get the bills across the finish line. And those come with a price tag, including, for example, the issue of the DREAMers, the... SIMON: Yeah. ELVING: ...People who were brought here by their parents when the parents came to the country illegally. SIMON: And how do they breach the differences between the House and Senate bills, when the promises some Republican Senate leaders made to get the votes of, say, Susan Collins of Maine and Jeff Flake of Arizona, seem to be no longer - are not contained in the House version? And the House leaders say nope, we're not going to have them. ELVING: This is why we always said that changing the tax code to this degree in this comprehensive fashion was going to be tough. It's a huge stretch. But here's the bottom line - they have to make that stretch. The Republican Party in Washington has simply decided that, after failing to repeal Obamacare earlier this year, they have to have this bill or else they're declaring themselves bankrupt as a party. So you can expect them to find ways to bring those last holdouts onboard. SIMON: Ron Elving, NPR's senior political correspondent - always, thanks so much for being with us. ELVING: Thank you, Scott.

            "article_content": "President Trump could see his first major legislative victory this week if Congress succeeds in passing the GOP tax overhaul bill. NPR guest host Ray Suarez speaks with NPR's Mara Liasson about what it means for Republican lawmakers.  RAY SUAREZ, HOST: Christmas may be coming early for Republicans with the final version of their tax bill now headed for a vote this week. After weeks of negotiation and some last-minute changes on Friday, House and Senate Republicans were able to come to an agreement. But is it still the once-in-a-generation tax overhaul they had hoped for? And there's still one big agenda item Congress needs to take care of before the end of the year - that's the budget. So will this be an opportunity for Democrats to get some of what they want? Let's bring in national political correspondent Mara Liasson. Hi, Mara. MARA LIASSON, BYLINE: Hi, Ray. SUAREZ: This will be the Republicans' first major legislative win of this Congress. Are they getting what they wanted? LIASSON: Well, you said it. They're getting what they wanted - their first major legislative win. That's what they really wanted. But this is a supply-side-trickle-down piece of legislation with big tax cuts for corporations and the wealthy. And that is pretty much where Republicans in Congress are, despite President Trump's populist rhetoric. Every step of the way, this bill was tweaked, and it tilted more and more and more to the wealthy. Economists say it will only have a modest effect on growth, big effect on the deficit. But at least, in the short term, everyone gets a tax cut - even a small one. And that's what the Republicans wanted. SUAREZ: Internally, they were talking about how they needed a win, but it is a very unpopular bill. Does this solve their political problem? LIASSON: I think it solves one of their political problems. They can go home to their donors and to their base voters and say, we cut taxes. As you said, the bill is unpopular. And now, the big question is, will voters notice that they got a tax cut? Will they be aware that, for individual taxpayers, those cuts are only temporary? And will this bill have the effect on the economy that the Republicans hope it will? SUAREZ: There's still work to get budgeting done. Given how unpopular the tax bill has been with Democrats, what do you think they'll insist on during budget negotiations? LIASSON: Well, the Congress passed another short-term budget bill that keeps the government open until December 22. So that means, this week, they're going to have to pass another one. What they're talking about is passing another short-term extension that just goes into January. But the Democrats are going to try to get some kind of relief for the DREAMers - that's the DACA bill that says that young people brought here illegally - in some cases, by their parents - could get relief from deportation. And Democrats want to make sure that if there are defense-spending hikes that domestic spending also gets increased. So when we get down to the last, final minute - whether it's this week or in January - Democrats are going to insist on those things in return for their votes. SUAREZ: Mara, let's turn to another issue percolating in Washington - special counsel Mueller's investigation into Russian interference in the election of 2016. Lawyers representing Trump's presidential transition have accused the Mueller team of obtaining unauthorized access to tens of thousands of emails from the transition. Explain what's going on there. LIASSON: What's going on here is that the Trump transition organization is saying that Robert Mueller obtained these emails from the transition illegally. And the context for this is there has been an intense and concerted effort from the White House, from President Trump and all of his supporters in conservative media to undermine and delegitimize Mueller and say that he's hopelessly biased against Trump and that everything he's doing is illegitimate. SUAREZ: And by way of explanation, what is the special counsel's office saying in reply? LIASSON: Right. The special counsel says that all of these emails were obtained either with the consent of the person who wrote them or through legal criminal procedures. So they feel they're on pretty strong ground. I think that this charge is much more of a political one than a legal one. It's just another way that Trump supporters can attack Mueller and undermine him, so that whatever he says, in the end, they can dismiss as fake news, as a witch hunt, a hoax - all of the things that President Trump has been calling this investigation. SUAREZ: That's Mara Liasson, NPR national political correspondent. Thanks, Mara. LIASSON: Thank you. Copyright \u00a9 2017 NPR.  All rights reserved.

            "article_content": "On the heels of cutting a deal with Democrats, President Trump raises the prospect of more bipartisanship.  ROBERT SIEGEL, HOST: One way to view the president's surprise deal with the Democrats is as a reaction to the powerful one-two punch of hurricanes Harvey and Irma. The idea is that it's easier to set aside partisan differences when a Category 5 storm is bearing down on the U.S. Whether this brings a lasting shift in political winds remains to be seen. NPR's Scott Horsley joins us now from the White House. And Scott, these back-to-back storms have consumed a lot of the president's attention in the last couple of weeks. How did that play into this deal with the Democrats? SCOTT HORSLEY, BYLINE: Robert, you're right. This has been a major focus. The president got a briefing this morning on preparations for hurricane Irma. He's issued a number of disaster declarations. And he says the twin disasters of Irma and Harvey added a sense of urgency to his meeting yesterday with Republican and Democratic congressional leaders. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: And I said, frankly it's time that we walk out and shake hands and have a deal. And they agreed. And I will tell you. It was - there was a lot of spirit in that room, a lot of good spirit. HORSLEY: The president also says he would have agreed to a longer-term deal that Republicans wanted, but he wants an opportunity in the next few months to revisit and beef up the Pentagon budget. SIEGEL: Scott, the White House has also talked about trying to clear the decks so that the president can focus on the rest of his agenda. Does this deal accomplish that? HORSLEY: It could make September a little easier. Remember; heading into this month, lawmakers had a long to-do list. They had to raise the debt ceiling, pass a spending bill to keep the government's doors open, approve a budget, which is a precondition for Republicans if they want to overhaul the tax code. And it's possible with this agreement Trump can cross at least two of those items off his list by this weekend. So that would free him up to spend more time, as he did yesterday, barnstorming the country in support of tax cuts. So he has cleared the decks temporarily. But remember; this is only a three-month deal. And so that means come early December, those decks are going to start getting crowded again. Lawmakers are going to have to take precious time at the end of the year when they would like to focus on, say, the tax overhaul. And once again, they're going to have to vote on government spending and the debt ceiling. SIEGEL: And that would be another opportunity for Democrats to extract something in return, right? HORSLEY: That's right. It's possible the Democrats will get something like the DREAM Act. And even if they don't extract a concession, Republicans would prefer not to have to cast a second vote on the debt ceiling before the midterm election. That's what they were trying to avoid with a longer-term deal. Raising the debt ceiling is always a tough vote for the party in power. It is often seen by the public as if lawmakers are giving the government a blank check even though in fact they're just agreeing to honor the checks they've already written with their spending bills. The president was asked today if he'd like to do away with this chore once and for all. Here's what Trump had to say. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) TRUMP: For many years, people have been talking about getting rid of debt ceiling altogether. And there are a lot of good reasons to do that. So certainly that's something that will be discussed. We even discussed it at the meeting that we had yesterday. HORSLEY: It's hard to imagine, though, that Republicans would actually do away with the requirement for a vote on the debt ceiling. It would just be too easy to paint that as an invitation to irresponsible spending even if that's not what it really is. SIEGEL: That's NPR's Scott Horsley at the White House. Scott, thanks.

            "article_content": "Lawmakers in Washington agreed to raising the debt limit and passed an emergency bill for hurricane victims this week, after President Trump made a deal with Democrats.  SCOTT SIMON, HOST: Both Hurricane Irma and Harvey have also had some impact in Washington, D.C., where a few glints of partisanship have broken out. NPR senior political correspondent and editor Ron Elving joins us. Ron, thanks so much for being with us. RON ELVING, BYLINE: Good to be with you, Scott. SIMON: Have the hurricanes - is it just sentimental nonsense, or have the hurricanes changed the political calculus in Washington, D.C.? ELVING: These storms have been bad enough to make even Washington snap to attention, Scott, and to make the two parties get together and do things like passing emergency spending bills for the hurricane victims. And of course, Washington also knows how to seize a crisis moment like this to move other more controversial things as well. So this vote this week for the hurricane victims also relaxed the limit on the national debt and agreed to continue spending for all federal programs at current levels until mid-December. And what's more, both of those things were done without any trade-offs for the fiscal hawks. And so 90 conservative House Republicans voted no on the package, and the Democrats provided the votes to put it over. SIMON: Yeah. Have these storms and the political crisis that attend them changed what you can detect in what I'll call President Trump's governing deportment? ELVING: It looks like it's been something of a learning experience for him, how to work the two parties against each other in such a moment - and also a learning moment for the rest of us as we got a different look at a different kind of Donald Trump, not the guy at the rally rabbling - rousing some sort of excited crowd to a fever pitch, but the dealmaker guy we used to hear about, the guy who, quote, \"talks New York,\" unquote, with the senator from that state, Chuck Schumer, another guy from the boroughs of New York City. And, you know, Chuck is a kind of a homeboy to him, and he's also the Democratic leader of the Senate. And they made this deal happen. SIMON: Yeah. And Nancy Pelosi, for that matter, is the creature of a big-city political organization... (CROSSTALK) ELVING: Baltimore... (CROSSTALK) SIMON: Yeah. ELVING: Yeah, Baltimore. SIMON: And of course represents San Francisco now. The president looked positively rollicking with Senator Schumer and Nancy Pelosi. If you could get a picture of the president and Mitch McConnell and Paul Ryan, would it look different? ELVING: Yeah (laughter). Someone once said that Calvin Coolidge looked like he had been weaned on a pickle. SIMON: (Laughter). ELVING: I think you get my point. SIMON: Yeah. ELVING: You know, Ryan and McConnell thought that Trump would back their terms for the fiscal crunch. They knew what was going to happen with hurricane aid. They knew there was going to be an effort to use that as a vehicle. And what they wanted was a much longer extension or a suspension on the debt limit so that they could get it out there past the next midterm election. And they also wanted a very different package in terms of the spending extensions. And he just pulled the Oval Office rug right out from under them. SIMON: Yeah. Tough issues coming up in Congress over the next couple of months - they've been, of course, challenged to come up with immigration reform in the next six months and resolve the issue of the DREAMers, people who came to this country with their parents illegally when they were young, many of them of course now working, going to school, in the armed forces - good citizens. And of course, the Congress has also kind of promised to do something about health care. Any issues closer to resolution after the events of this week? ELVING: Not necessarily at this point. But we may be seeing a way forward. We're glimpsing this in Trump's new and demonstrated willingness to work with either party - or both parties - to get something that looks good for him. So for example, DACA could wind up being made permanent by statute. That is the policy by which the DREAMers were allowed to stay in this country. That could actually become law, which was what President Obama always wanted to do, but Congress wouldn't let him. So that would be a great resolution for the DREAMers. It would be a marvelous trophy for Donald Trump. And to some degree, that would appear to be the bottom line. SIMON: Weaned on a pickle - I'm going to remember (laughter) that for some time. Thanks very much for... ELVING: Thank you, Scott. SIMON: ...Elevating our intelligence once again. NPR's Ron Elving. Copyright \u00a9 2017 NPR.  All rights reserved.

            "article_content": "The new year is less than a week away, and it's good time to look back over the past political headlines from 2017. And, a suicide bomber blew himself up near the Afghan Intelligence Agency in Kabul.  DAVID GREENE, HOST: We are less than a week away from 2018. And, you know, Noel, in 2017 - in this business, especially - we just keep talking about the sheer number of headlines NOEL KING, HOST: So many headlines, especially in U.S. politics - so NPR's political editor Domenico Montanaro decided to try and rank the top political stories of the year and then turn them into a March Madness-style bracket. GREENE: And Domenico is with us. Hey there. DOMENICO MONTANARO, BYLINE: Hey. GREENE: A March Madness-style bracket - were you just bored over the holiday weekend? MONTANARO: I was bored, David. GREENE: OK. MONTANARO: No. You know what it is - is that I was trying to do an end-of-the-year ranking for the biggest stories of the year, and the list just kept on growing. And I'm a pretty big March Madness fan, and for as long as I can remember - I think to when I was 8 - I was ranking things and putting them in brackets and thought, hey, why not try it with politics? GREENE: So this is your thing, OK. MONTANARO: This is my thing. GREENE: So you have seeds, and I would - I gather the No. 1 seeds are the seeds - the stories that you think would be the big favorites to be the biggest news story of the year. So what are they? MONTANARO: The chalk, as they would say in college basketball parlance. The overall No. 1 seed is the continuing fallout over sexual harassment, as you can imagine - just a huge story. It's touched every industry - going to be tough to beat. But then you look at the other No. 1s, and they're pretty strong too, including James Comey being fired - the former FBI director - the ensuing Russia probe by Robert Mueller that came out of that, and of course, the tree that almost everything in 2017 stems from - President Trump's inauguration, David. GREENE: Which was a big, defining moment for this country. So are there sleepers? I mean, can we continue this metaphor and talk about schools or stories that might sneak up on us and, you know, be considered a big deal? MONTANARO: Yeah, the only time that a 16 seed has defeated a 1 seed in college basketball history was in 1998 when the Harvard women's team beat Stanford. So there's never... GREENE: Uh-huh, I watched that game, Domenico, you should know. MONTANARO: There has never been a 1-16 upset in the men's tournament. You know, will the trend continue in this tournament? I don't know. Let's see. Some on Twitter have been threatening to advance Trump looks at eclipse over him being inaugurated, but kind of - that just feels like trolling. GREENE: (Laughter) Yeah. MONTANARO: I'd be shocked if that happens. I'd look instead at the 6-seeded Donald Trump Jr.'s email revelations - pretty big story to advance in the second round in that bracket. But it's going to be kind of hard for it to get past No. 3, gun violence. It was pretty sweeping, thematic story of the year, obviously. I'd also watch deportations and DACA at No. 5. There's been a lot of chatter about that, and lots of people in early brackets that have been coming in, picking that over Trump being inaugurated. And the one story a lot of people can't seem to let go - Anthony Scaramucci's 10 days in the White House. It is, by the way, an ironically seeded 10 seed to upset No. 7, New York truck attack - obviously, far more serious and important, but that's what happens when people decide. GREENE: It's amazing. And I guess - I mean, you know, stories are things that people internalize personally, so something like gun violence - I mean, it's something that someone might take much more seriously and consider it a much bigger story. So you actually want people to, quote, unquote, \"play\" - right? - and give you a sense of what they think - or one story is more or less important than the other. MONTANARO: Absolutely. Go on my Twitter feed - @DomenicoNPR - download the bracket there - it's pinned - submit it by noon today in that tweet thread. And I have promised a very special NPR prize. And David, I'm sorry to do this to you. I know it's the first time you're hearing this, but I promised them your voice on their answering machine. I hope that's OK with you. GREENE: I don't think anyone wants that. KING: (Laughter). GREENE: But if they do, I'm more than happy to do it, so I will play along. NPR's Domenico Montanaro. Domenico, thanks. MONTANARO: Hey, you're welcome. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) GREENE: OK, we're going to turn now to Afghanistan, where a suicide bomber blew himself up near the Afghan intelligence agency yesterday in Kabul. KING: Yes, six people were killed, and ISIS claimed responsibility for the attack. The militant group emerged two years ago in Afghanistan, and despite airstrikes by the U.S. military and by Afghan security, ISIS is still a relentless and deadly force in Afghanistan. GREENE: And we're going to turn to NPR's Diaa Hadid, who is following this story from neighboring Pakistan. She's in Islamabad. Hi, Diaa. DIAA HADID, BYLINE: Good morning. GREENE: So how serious is this threat of ISIS in Afghanistan right now? HADID: It's pretty serious, in part because people don't even know how many fighters there are in the country. Just today, a senior Afghan security official said there was probably around 2,000 fighters, but he was speaking in response to a Russian envoy who reportedly said there were 10,000 fighters in the country. GREENE: Oh, whoa. HADID: Yeah, so you can see that even internally, there's a very vocal debate about how many fighters there are. And the other thing is - is that they seem to be shifting around the country. They're most active and present near the Pakistan border, but now local news in Afghanistan is saying that they've also established themselves way up north near the Turkmenistan border. That's quite a distance from Pakistan. GREENE: But even if they're based in these places, are they mostly targeting and attacking Kabul at this point? HADID: Yeah. I mean, these are at least the attacks that are most heavily covered by local media in Afghanistan, and that's for a good reason. ISIS is attacking the seat of government, and it's attacking the place where its allies - you know, Western powers - have based themselves. And so what it's showing these two forces is that it can still strike at, you know, their beating heart, even though they're being attacked quite relentlessly by, you know, dozens, if not hundreds, of airstrikes at this point. And keep in mind, some of these attacks are brutal. Some ISIS attacks have killed more than 20, more than 30, even more than 50 people at once. GREENE: Well, it - you say that geographically, they're targeting the seat of power and where, you know, Western diplomats are. But what do they want? I mean, what or who were they targeting and for what reason? HADID: Right. So I'm just going to be the bad-news fairy. Like, it's even more worrying when we look at who they're targeting. They're targeting security forces and security installations in Afghanistan. And what they're trying to do there, it seems, is lower already-eroding morale among Afghan security forces. They have high casualty rates, low retention rates, and this is a further incentive to give up the fight against ISIS. But the other group that they're targeting are Shiite civilians. ISIS has attacked their mosques around Afghanistan, and this risks further destabilizing Pakistan by triggering a sectarian conflict. And I was speaking to a local reporter in Afghanistan, Aziz Tasal (ph), and he was saying that he meets worshipers who are now afraid of going to Shiite mosques. And what that does is erodes people's, like, faith or even legitimacy in the government that's meant to protect them. GREENE: It's almost like they feel like they will benefit from chaos if they can create as much of it as possible. HADID: Indeed, indeed. GREENE: NPR's Diaa Hadid speaking to us about the situation in Afghanistan from her base in Islamabad. Diaa, thanks. We appreciate it. HADID: You're welcome. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) GREENE: All right, we're going to focus now a bit on Iran. 2017 was sort of a mixed year for that country, and we're going to talk about what 2018 might bring. KING: Yeah, President Hassan Rouhani won and won big re-election to a second term earlier this year, and that 2015 nuclear deal could still mean good things for Iran's economy. But Rouhani is dealing with hard-liners at home, and the Trump administration, of course, is calling for the world to get tougher on Iran. GREENE: NPR's Peter Kenyon has covered many stories that have to do with Iran in 2017. He joins us from Istanbul. Hi, Peter. PETER KENYON, BYLINE: Hey, David. GREENE: So you were actually there in Tehran for the presidential election in May that Noel mentioned, right? KENYON: Yeah. GREENE: Rouhani easily defeated a hard-line cleric. What did it feel like? KENYON: Well, I was there, and so was Steve Inskeep, and it was an exciting time for moderates and reformers in Iran. They rallied around Rouhani, even though he's not really one of them. He's more of a pragmatist. But their votes - these moderate and reform votes - helped Rouhani win a big victory. Hard-liners were embarrassed at the polls, really. And some analysts were saying, well, maybe now things will get better - more reform-minded power. But that really hasn't panned out so far. Hard-liners have started pushing back. They attack Rouhani every chance they get. And he's kind of been struggling. He hasn't really been able to get his No. 1 priority done, which is getting the economy moving again. GREENE: Is that the call to prayer we're hearing behind you in Istanbul? KENYON: It is, indeed. GREENE: That's lovely. That sound will never get old to me. It's a beautiful moment. KENYON: The joys of live radio. GREENE: Yeah. So well, OK, back to Iran - Rouhani is - help me understand this. He is still pushing for economic deals and a better relationship with European countries and others. But then you have these threats from the Trump administration to derail the entire nuclear agreement that had lifted many of the international sanctions Iran that would've freed them up for - how does this all work? KENYON: Well, the nuclear deal lives. That's the bottom line - in spite of the threats from Washington. President Trump declared Iran not in compliance, although the agency that's really in charge of that says, oh, yes, they are. But this hostile posture from Washington is giving some companies pause about whether it's really going to be OK to dive in and do business with Iran. And economists say at the street level, yeah, just a marginal impact so far. On the other hand, critics point to the Revolutionary Guard, which is a military force deeply embedded in the Iranian economy. They have been benefiting, and that's caused a lot of fears in the West. Some people want new talks now to curb Iran's missile program and other things. Iran really hasn't shown much interest in that. GREENE: So as we look ahead to 2018, I mean, Washington has Iran at the top of its list of global threats. What - how does Iran respond, and what does Iran want? KENYON: Well, what they would like is a lot more certainty than what they see right now. They know that Trump has promised a tougher policy. Allies aren't necessarily going along with it. Saudi Arabia has been much more aggressive in the region, and with the fight against ISIS winding down in Syria, I mean, this situation could get very complicated, indeed. GREENE: NPR's Peter Kenyon in Istanbul talking to us about Iran and what we might expect in the new year. Peter, thanks. KENYON: Thanks, David.

Jeff Flake, R-Ariz., wrote a new book, in secret, criticizing President Trump and Republicans who have not stood up to him in defense of conservative values.\n                \n                    \n                    Ralph Freso/Getty Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption Sen. Jeff Flake, R-Ariz., wrote a new book, in secret, criticizing President Trump and Republicans who have not stood up to him in defense of conservative values. Arizona Sen. Jeff Flake wrote his new book Conscience of a Conservative: A Rejection of Destructive Politics and a Return to Principle in secret, not even telling his closest political advisers about his plans until it was ready. And given the political test he'll face over the coming year, it isn't hard to see why. Flake is up for re-election in 2018, where he faces real threats from both the left and the right. His book is inspired by former Arizona Sen. Barry Goldwater's 1960 tome of the same name and is direct in its criticisms not just of President Trump, but toward other Republicans for, as Flake sees it, turning a blind eye and making a \"Faustian bargain\" when Trump abandoned many core conservative principles like free trade, and for his controversial stands, from birtherism to racial dog whistles. While the things he lays out in his book may well endear him to independents and even Democrats in Arizona, the radical way he takes on Trump without abandon certainly won't help him in his first test next year: a GOP primary where challengers \u2014 who are being egged on by the White House \u2014 are already circling. by Jeff Flake Hardcover, 160 pages | Your purchase helps support NPR programming. How? Near the end of the 2016 election, seeing major GOP figures criticize the party's nominee was nothing out of the ordinary. Many \u2014 including Flake \u2014 refused to vote for Trump and further craved distance after his vulgar 2005 Access Hollywood tape surfaced. But come November, against all odds, Trump rode a populist wave to victory, giving Republicans control of the White House, Congress and selection of a new Supreme Court justice to boot. With unified control of Washington, criticizing the new president suddenly waned in GOP circles. Now, as Trump continues to stumble after 200 days in office, Flake writes that their relative successes shouldn't matter: \"I write this book because we as conservatives \u2014 and conservatism itself \u2014 are in crisis.\" Flake admits that may seem like \"a preposterous claim,\" given that they control the government. \"But make no mistake, as a governing philosophy, conservatism is indeed in crisis \u2014 and not in spite of this apparent success but because of it,\" later blasting self-described conservatives for changing their political stripes \"depending on fashion or the passions of the day or based on how much applause a line in a speech received at a rally.\" Trump's theory to win in 2016 was to draw out white, working-class voters who hadn't shown up for Republicans in years, but he failed to broaden the electorate by targeting younger and more racially diverse voters as the GOP's 2012 autopsy recommended. Flake says that strategy was only a Band-Aid, giving in to the \"sugar high of populism, nativism, and demagoguery. The crash from this sugar high will be particularly unpleasant.\" \"We have given in to the politics of anger \u2014 the belief that riling up the base can make up for failed attempts to broaden the electorate,\" Flake writes. \"These are the spasms of a dying party.\" Flake argues throughout that just because Republicans notched an unlikely win last November, they shouldn't take that as a mandate or a signal that the type of politics Trump and his disciples preach should become the conservative gospel. In fact, he makes clear he believes many of their populist pitches are downright heretical. Trump spent the entire 2016 campaign assailing free trade, appealing to Rust Belt workers hit hard by declines in manufacturing jobs that he argued were the result of bad trade deals, but in reality were more of a result of technological advances. Abandoning a core economic principle of the conservative movement and the Republican Party for generations, when Trump got into office he withdrew the U.S. from the Trans-Pacific Partnership, and soon his administration will begin renegotiation of the North American Free Trade Agreement. A good portion of the book is spent outlining why Flake believes free trade is so critical to a healthy U.S. economy and why it's been the backbone of conservative economics. He calls Trump flat-out wrong for opposing it and criticizes other Republicans for not pushing back more. \"Rather than fighting the populist wave that threatened to engulf us, rather than defending the enduring principles that were consonant with everything that we knew and had believed in, we pretended that the emperor wasn't naked,\" he writes. \"Even worse: We checked our critical faculties at the door and pretended that the emperor was making sense.\" \"Never has a party so quickly or easily abandoned its core principles as my party did in the course of the 2016 campaign....lurch[ing] like a tranquilized elephant from a broad consensus on economic philosophy and free trade that had held for generations to an incoherent and often untrue mash of back-of-the-envelope populist slogans. Seemingly overnight,\" Flake laments, blaming \"powerful nativist impulses that have arisen in the face of fear and insecurity over the swiftly evolving global economy.\" Decrying the \"nativist impulse\" in immigration policy Flake, a border state Republican, is also at odds with Trump \u2014 and many within his own party \u2014 on the issue of immigration. \"We have to return to the politics of comity and inclusion and reject the politics of xenophobia and demonization,\" writes the former member of the Gang of Eight, the bipartisan group that pushed a comprehensive immigration reform bill through the Senate in 2013, only to see it die in the House. We have given in to the politics of anger \u2014 the belief that riling up the base can make up for failed attempts to broaden the electorate... These are the spasms of a dying party. Flake opens up about why he's so sympathetic to the plight of immigrants, and it's not just because of the large Hispanic population of the state he represents. There are humanizing elements and personal reflections throughout that give a glimpse into how his upbringing and faith have shaped his conservative worldview. The son of a rancher who depended on migrant labor, Flake talks about how he got \"to know immigrants intimately and honestly. You learn through experience how indispensable they are to making things work in America.\" And the \"nativist impulse\" that crescendoed throughout 2016 is \"always destructive, always comes with a cost, and never ends well.\" As a devout Mormon, Flake also recalled the plight of his own forefathers, recalling how in 1838 the Missouri governor signed an order saying that the religious group \"must be exterminated or driven from the state if necessary.\" And he talks about how it was a group of Muslim immigrant doctors who saved his father-in-law's life after he suffered a massive heart attack. \"When we say 'No Muslims,' or 'No Mexicans,' we may as well say 'No Mormons,'\" Flake writes. \"Because it is no different.\" Flake immediately denounced Trump's proposed Muslim ban when he unveiled it on the campaign trail in December 2015, and even visited a mosque shortly after to show his support. For that action, he received a note of support and thanks from former President George W. Bush \u2014 who had visited a mosque in the wake of the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks to try to temper anti-Muslim sentiments. Now that he's president, Trump has tried to push through another ban on immigration from six, originally seven, Muslim-majority countries, which has been logjammed in the courts and will eventually be ruled on by the Supreme Court this fall. Flake concedes that any president does have broad latitude over national security matters, and likely the order was within Trump's rights, as he and his advisers have argued. But the Arizona senator rebuts that \"there is a world of difference between believing you can do something and that you should do something.\" There has been a marked decline in illegal border crossings under Trump and then-Department of Homeland Security Secretary John Kelly, now the president's new chief of staff. \"Other side\" is not the enemy Flake is also deeply troubled by the lines of demarcation drawn between parties, and how even helping or working with \u2014 or, heaven forbid, saying nice things about \u2014 someone from the dreaded \"other side\" is interpreted as partisan treason. In one poignant anecdote, he recalls how he sat with his Arizona colleague, former Democratic Rep. Gabrielle Giffords, as she attended the State of the Union one year after she was nearly assassinated during a constituent event. Still recovering from a debilitating brain injury, she wanted to stand to applaud President Barack Obama but couldn't do it on her own. So Flake helped her rise, leaving him as \"a lone Republican among cheering Democrats.\" That gesture prompted him to receive \"furious text messages and emails\" from constituents demanding to know why he \"agreed with President Obama.\" Similarly, when he dared to send out a supportive tweet about Virginia Sen. Tim Kaine after he had been chosen as Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton's running mate last year, calling him a \"good man and a good friend,\" Flake felt \"remarkable, unhinged fury from the ideologues\" in return. By that time, Flake had already made his concerns with Trump well-known, and the then-GOP nominee even told him when he came to Capitol Hill to meet with senators that Flake would lose his election in November; Flake wasn't up until the following cycle, however. \"I am a proud conservative and a lifelong Republican. That does not make the Democrats my enemies. America has too many real enemies to indulge such nonsense,\" Flake writes. For Flake, that extends to the press as well, which Trump and his advisers have frequently branded the \"opposition party.\" He's deeply troubled by the spread of \"fake news\" and conspiracy theories \u2014 but not in the way Trump throws around the term to be a catch-all for any mainstream media story he dislikes. Calling it \"madness to turn ourselves inside out in an attempt to make reality comport with an alternate reality, just because someone in power would like us to,\" Flake says such attacks on the truth itself, and questioning what are facts in favor of \"alternative facts,\" are \"a threat to democracy\" and certainly not becoming of any conservative principles. It's something he's faced blowback for back home when he took the fact-based position that yes, Obama had been born in the U.S. He calls out Fox News and other conservative sites for continuing to promulgate the myth. He recalls being jeered at a Tea Party event when he said he did believe President Obama was a citizen, saying that \"to be booed because I didn't subscribe to a right-wing conspiracist fantasy about our first African American president is a sobering experience indeed.\" \"When a conspiracy theory becomes litmus-test orthodoxy, objective reality is at risk,\" Flake bemoans. 2018 brings political challenges for Flake Something else that could be at risk is Flake's own political future. Trump has reportedly talked about spending as much as $10 million to defeat Flake in a primary, and last week the White House wouldn't confirm or deny whether the president would support a challenger to Flake. Press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders did say that Flake \"would serve his constituents much better if he was less focused on writing a book and attacking the president\" and zeroed in on \"passing legislation\" instead. But Flake has, in fact, backed most of Trump's appointees and political agenda so far, even voting for the failed Senate GOP health care bill even as it was Arizona's other senator \u2014 another frequent Trump critic John McCain\u2014 whose \"no\" vote torpedoed it. And while Flake's 136-page manifesto pulls no punches, in some of the interviews he's done after the book came out he hasn't been as pugnacious in going after the president, as he was on NBC's Meet the Press this past weekend, perhaps denying ad-makers of damaging clips. For now, though, Flake's marker against the president and those in his party he brands as conservative sellouts is the biggest indication yet of how Trump \u2014 part unwilling, part unable \u2014 has failed to unite the GOP, exposing the large fissures that still remain despite Republican sweeps last November. As Republicans head into 2018 and beyond, Flake says he is trying to save the party from themselves. \"This is not an act of apostasy. This is an act of fidelity,\" Flake writes as his conclusion. However, the Arizona senator also risks making this book his swan song. Whether other Republicans follow \u2014 or whether Flake himself is even around in 18 months \u2014 will show whether he was among the first in his party to take on the president successfully or the first casualty of President Trump's penchant for political payback.",

French voters cast their ballots Sunday, in a historic presidential election that's reverberating around the globe and pitting two unconventional candidates against each other. Far-right candidate Marine Le Pen faces centrist Emmanuel Macron after voters bucked France's traditional two-party system in April's first round of the election. Le Pen \u2014 a Euro-skeptic \u2014 heads the National Front, a party once associated with racism and xenophobia. The pro-Europe and immigrant-friendly Macron has never held elected office and ran as an independent. The outcome of the election could have a profound effect on the future of the European Union and globalization amid a wave of populism and protectionism. Voting takes place two days after Macron's campaign was hacked  and thousands of his emails released. The move reminded observers of the hack on the Clinton campaign in the American election, which U.S. intelligence agencies concluded was orchestrated by Russia to benefit now President Trump. Trump has expressed support for Le Pen, telling the Associated Press, \"She's the strongest on borders.\" Former President Obama endorsed Macron in a video released Friday, saying Macron \"has stood up for liberal values.\" France has a blackout on all campaigning and media coverage that began Friday. Most polls close at 7 p.m. local time Sunday (1 p.m. ET), but remain open an hour later in Paris and other big cities. Polling companies release winner projections immediately afterward.",

Marine Le Pen, France's far-right presidential candidate, said she would name former rival, Nicolas Dupont-Aignan, as her prime minister if she wins the May 7 election. The two appeared together at a news conference in Paris, Saturday. \"We will form a government of national unity that brings together people chosen for their competence and their love of France,\" Le Pen said, as quoted by Reuters. A day earlier, the interim leader of Le Pen's National Front party stepped down over controversial comments about the Holocaust. Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Jalkh had only had the job for three days. Also on Friday, Dupont-Aignan announced his endorsement of Le Pen. As NPR's Eleanor Beardsley reports, it is the first time a mainstream party has aligned itself with the far-right group. Le Pen has been seeking to de-demonize the National Front, by drawing in more young people and women. Her father, Jean-Marie Le Pen, known for anti-Semitism and xenophobia, founded the party and led it until his daughter replaced him in 2011 and later kicked him out. The two no longer speak. Dupont-Aignan is with the right wing party \"Stand Up France,\" and said Saturday, he does not consider Le Pen an extreme right candidate. The New York Times reports, the two politicians share numerous views, including a euroskepticism and a hardline approach to security. That stands in contrast with Le Pen's opponent, Emmanuel Macron, a 39-year-old centrist who is pro-European Union and a fierce defender of immigration. Dupont-Aignan lost the first round of the election with less than 5 percent of the vote, but he will presumably bring those near 2 million voters to Le Pen's side on election day. Polls have shown Macron leading in the race, but Le Pen has been gaining ground.",

On Tuesday British Prime Minister Theresa May announced plans to hold a snap general election on June 8. Following Britain's decision last summer to exit the European Union she said that, \"Britain needed certainty, stability and strong leadership\" ahead Britain of settling its divorce from the EU. This surprise news came as a shock to the political establishment in London. Last year May ruled out holding an election before 2020, but she has now reversed course. May's about face has caused political and public opinion waves across Britain, especially because her announcement comes mere weeks after the government set in motion the official process to leave the European Union, known as Brexit. May has said this was a historic moment for Britain, one that the country would not be turning back from. A sizable number of black Brits might see the new vote as a second chance to take a stand against a future they did not vote for in the first place. In total, 73 percent of black Brits voted for Britain to remain in the EU, as did 67 percent of Asian voters. Meanwhile, 53 percent of whites voted for Britain to leave the EU. The Brexit referendum has put a spotlight on racial divides in Britain, and has led to a marked rise in racism that is making many black Britons feel like they are no longer welcome at home. The news of this impending election has added more intensity to the Brexit fallout black Britons have been dealing with since the referendum last June. But, Simon Woolley, director of Operation Black Vote (OBV), an organization that campaigns for racial justice in Britain, said the prime minister's decision \"was probably motivated more by Brexit EU politics more than any immediate domestic political considerations.\" He added that over the next several weeks OBV would \"fight for race equality and fight against xenophobia. We'll engage in a late voter registration drive, hold hustings meetings in marginal seats, write a black political manifesto and hold a national meeting with major party leaders.\" Brexit has made many black people question their place in British society, and this pending vote may yet heighten this experience. Rikette, a popular jazz singer from Brixton, says that, \"as a black Briton, Brexit has made me question just how British I am. This is something I have not had to think about before, and, due to the rise in racist abuse, this has made me feel a little more vulnerable in public spaces, especially on public transport.\" Indeed, since Brexit was enacted the number of hate crimes recorded on public transit has increased. Zara Tewolde-Berhan, 24, a writer in London born to Eritrean parents, says \"the message of Brexit is clear, it does not make me feel welcome.\" And now with an election looming she says, \"I feel like this was a rushed decision to call an election, I am so confused and uncertain about my future now, and I am worried what this will mean for black people in Britain.\" As a young person who, like her age group, voted overwhelmingly to remain part of the EU, she says she fears that the economic effects of Brexit will have a disproportionate impact on black Britons. \"I feel that opportunities are now much slimmer as a Black Brit,\" she says. Black and Asian graduates are twice as likely as white graduates to be unemployed. This is something Tewolde-Berhan experienced when she graduated from university and struggled to find a job. Black male graduates in London are twice as likely to be unemployed as their white counterparts; there was an unemployment rate 16 percent for black male graduates in London last year. This is shocking considering that 44 percent of London's 8.6 million people come from an ethnic minority. Nor is it just young black graduates that face such grim unemployment prospects. Across the board, black workers in Britain earn far less than their white counterparts with the same qualifications \u2014 at every educational level. According to research from the Trades Union Congress (TUC), a confederation of unions in Britain, there is a 23 percent pay gap between black and white workers. Their research also shows that black graduates earn \u00a314.33 an hour while white graduates earn \u00a318.63. Charlene Prempeh, brand director at London-based Nataal, a media consultancy that promotes African creatives, says \"In London, the key change since Brexit is that the subject of race has become dinner party fodder \u2014 every white person I know is keen to profess how liberal they are, how much they want the country to stay open, how they are not racist.\" Prempeh, whose family migrated from Ghana, also says, \"However, outside of London the atmosphere is openly hostile.\" On a recent day trip to Whitstable, a seashore town about an hour and a half south of London, where she says once \"people would have been too embarrassed to stare\" at her, Prempeh \"felt uncomfortable enough to avoid eye contact and in the end we left the town early.\" Official figures from the British government show that there was a huge rise in racist and religious hate crimes immediately after the Brexit vote. Further, the number of hate crimes recorded by regional police forces in England and Wales rose by a 100 percent in the months following. This spike has led the police to announce extra plans to help protect vulnerable groups. For some British black people, Brexit shattered the illusion of truly belonging in Britain. Chrystal Genesis, a London-born broadcaster whose family hail from the West Indies, feels that for her the immediate consequence of Brexit has been that people she knows feel that white people have become more openly racist. In some instances black politicians have come under attack. David Lammy, a Member of Parliament from London, called the police after receiving a surge in online abuse and death threats. Genesis says this reminds her \"that no matter how long you have lived here and grown up in Britain and even if you are third generation, you are never truly British. That is a fact.\" Brexit has not only reopened racial faultiness in Britain, but it has begun to normalize a new racism in the so-called post-racial age that isn't all that different from the racism that greeted black immigrants like Genesis's grandfather who arrived in Britain in the 1950s from Jamaica. \"It felt like the stories my grandfather told me when I was young about the 1950's when he was invited over to Britain to work by building up Britain after the war, and the racism and awful experiences he encountered. It's beyond appalling now how the same racist attitudes show themselves; the only difference is that it is a different decade,\" she says. Prior to the vote, most black lawmakers supported remaining in the EU as most of them belong to the Labour Party. But a few Conservative Party lawmakers of color, such as Kwasi Kwarteng and Adam Afriyie did support leave. Labour Party politician Chuka Umunna, who was once touted as British Obama, is leading a campaign to hold the government to account over their Brexit negotiations with the EU. Other prominent black British public figures came out against Brexit also. Writing in Ebony, Kehinde Andrews, a professor of sociology at Birmingham City University, said Brexit had redrawn racial faultiness in Britain and the results of the referendum reflected \"the nation's buried racial tension.\" Woolley, at OBV, wrote of Brexit, \"Not since the 1970's have we seen day-to-day extreme racial abuse and violence on the streets of Britain.\" For many black citizens, Brexit has confirmed that Britain is more than just uncomfortable with change. Anti-immigration sentiment was at the heart of what drove the UK to end its 44-year relationship with the European Union. Fears about immigrants and diversity drove many older voters into the pro-Brexit campaign, with just 39 percent of those over 65 voting to remain in the EU Since the Brexit vote, Britain has also become less tolerant. According to police in England and Wales, hate and religious crimes rose 41 percent after Britain voted to leave the EU. A national poll in March found that in the seven months following the Brexit vote over a third of black, Asian or minority people in Britain had witnessed or experienced racial abuse. And on the day the government trigged the process for Britain to quit the EU, researchers documented a spike in online hate speech. Moreover, May has disparaged those who did not vote to quit the EU as \"crybabies\" and mocked as \"citizens of nowhere\" and \"metropolitan liberal elites\" anyone who says Brexit is bad for Britain. Dissenters are routinely accused of being disloyal and un-British. For many black Brits, May's attacks about \"citizens of the world\" were especially galling as many of are connected to an international diaspora that transcends national borders.

The \"most beautiful candidate in Serbia\" (self-proclaimed) arrives in the sleepy town of Kovavica at midday, a loudspeaker perched atop his aging car. He's tall, blue-eyed and wearing his signature white suit, tie and shoes, his long hair in a man-bun. His name is Ljubisa Beli Preletacevic, or just Beli for short. It means \"the guy in white who switches his beliefs for political gain,\" says the candidate himself. \"I'm every bad politician rolled up into one young, strong man,\" he declares. Beli's real name is Luka Maksimovic. He's a 25-year-old communications student from Mladenovac, a depressed former factory town outside the capital, Belgrade. Last year, the satirical political party he started, Sarmu probo nisi (\"You haven't tasted the sarma,\" a kind of stuffed cabbage roll), won 20 percent of the vote in Mladenovac and 12 seats on the municipal council, though so far no members have been elected to parliament. Most of those councilors are actually serious, like local councilwoman Jovana Ilic, who wants to make government more transparent. Jovana Ilic is a councilwoman representing Beli's party, Sarmu probo nisi, on the Mladenovac town council. \"We use humor to do very serious things, like push for transparency in local government,\" she says.\n                \n                    \n                    Joanna Kakissis for NPR\n                    \n                \nhide caption Jovana Ilic is a councilwoman representing Beli's party, Sarmu probo nisi, on the Mladenovac town council. \"We use humor to do very serious things, like push for transparency in local government,\" she says. \"We show people how every one of us can be the change in our society,\" she says. Serbs will elect a new president this Sunday, and a recent public opinion poll shows 11 percent of voters supporting Beli. That means he's running second to the favorite, Aleksandar Vucic, the current prime minister, backed by more than half of Serb voters. Beli is running ahead of more established candidates such as Serbia's former national ombudsman, Sasa Jankovic. Vucic, once a far-right nationalist allied with strongman Slobodan Milosevic, now promotes himself as a pro-EU reformer. He maintains a firm grip on most of Serbia's media. On Thursday, days before the presidential election, seven major newspapers published Vucic's campaign poster on their front pages. \"Some voters may have noticed that Vucic leads a system that's a malfunction of democracy, like Viktor Orban in Hungary,\" says Vojislav Zanetic, a political analyst in Belgrade. \"Others blame him because they are worse off economically than there were in the past.\" Ivica Marinkovic, a 48-year-old ironsmith who supports Beli, says Vucic may claim to be a pro-Western reformer, but has behaved as an autocrat and done little to improve life for regular Serbs. Presidential candidate Luka Maksimovic, known as Beli, a 25-year-old satirist, campaigns in the Serbian town of Mladenovac on March 21.\n                \n                    \n                    Andrej Isakovic/AFP/Getty Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption Presidential candidate Luka Maksimovic, known as Beli, a 25-year-old satirist, campaigns in the Serbian town of Mladenovac on March 21. The unemployment rate in this country of about seven million was 19 percent last year. \"Life must be really bad for us if we are voting for a young comedian who is running for president under a fake persona,\" Marinkovic sighs. He's sipping a Czech beer at a music bar in Mladenovac owned by Luka Maksimovic's family. A cousin, Jasmina \"Pera\" Numic, a 43-year-old singer, belts out a few bars of her favorite song, \"At Last,\" then explains that satire is the way Serbs deal with pain. \"In the baddest times, we laugh,\" she says. \"We choose to smile before crying, even when we want to cry.\" Zanetic, the political analyst, explains that Beli and his party are like the Balkan version of the populist movement sweeping Europe \u2014 and the U.S. \u2014 though they don't share the xenophobia and anti-European Union sentiments of right-wing populists such as France's Marine Le Pen and The Netherlands' Geert Wilders. \"I think people who are supporting Beli are too angry or too disappointed to support anyone else,\" Zanetic says. Beli's presidential campaign slogan is Samo Jako, which means \"hit it hard\" in Serbian. Campaign videos feature him doing push-ups, sucking on raw eggs and riding a white horse. He kicked off the final week of his campaign by artificially inseminating a cow. Jasmina Numic, a cousin of Luka Maksimovic, whose satirical alter ego, Ljubisa \"Beli\" Preletacevic, is running for president. \"Luka has always been a creative guy with creative ideas to get people involved in civic life,\" she says. \"He wants to use Beli get Serbs to wake up and hold their politicians accountable.\"\n                \n                    \n                    Joanna Kakissis for NPR\n                    \n                \nhide caption Jasmina Numic, a cousin of Luka Maksimovic, whose satirical alter ego, Ljubisa \"Beli\" Preletacevic, is running for president. \"Luka has always been a creative guy with creative ideas to get people involved in civic life,\" she says. \"He wants to use Beli get Serbs to wake up and hold their politicians accountable.\" \"A new politician is here to save you!\" he says in Kovacica, as townspeople come out of their shops and homes to greet him. \"I'm pure and clean. Whatever the other politicians promise you, I will promise you three times more.\" The residents of this northern Serbian town are thrilled to see him. Grown men in handlebar mustaches hug him. Grandmothers pinch his cheeks. He buys all of them ice cream. \"I'll give jobs to everyone, and big pensions to everyone!\" he declares. \"I'm going to move the sea here because we need a beach! I will be a great uniter of the Balkans and we will be a superpower!\" Drama student Danka Svetilova laughs and asks for a selfie with Beli in front of a local museum of peasant art. She says mainstream politicians have been lying to Serbs for years. \"And we were just tolerating that and not doing anything,\" she says. \"But [Beli] is awesome because what he's doing is really a parody [of that] political scene in Serbia.\" That's why she and her schoolteacher mom are both voting for him. Better a fake candidate who tells the truth about lying, she says, than a real one who lies about telling the truth. Before he leaves Kovacica, Beli makes another declaration. \"There will be no corruption \u2014 excluding my own, of course,\" he says. \"Please send all money directly to my pockets.\" Then he's off to his next campaign stop in Zrenjanin, where about 2,000 people are waiting for him in a park. \"Ave Beli!\" they chant, as night falls. \"Welcome! Samo Jako!\"",

Suddenly, people are more in favor of the Affordable Care Act than are against it. For the first time, more people believe Obamacare is a good idea than think it is a bad idea, as a recent NBC News/Wall Street Journal poll showed. Another poll from Fox News shows a similar pattern, as the New York Times' Margot Sanger-Katz and Haeyoun Park pointed out in a story Wednesday. \"CNN/ORC Poll shows last-minute love for Obamacare,\" blared a CNN headline the day before Donald Trump's inauguration. There are a few reasons the balance might be tipping: It may be that growing participation in Obamacare has slowly tipped polls. It may be that Democrats' messaging that millions might lose coverage is sinking in. But a particularly compelling theory could mix in with either or both of these: relative deprivation. Relative deprivation describes being deprived of something a person feels entitled to. For example, they used to have it, expected to have it, or see that others have it. The theory helps explain this political moment of anger in America \u2014 whether it's the rise in popularity of Obamacare (in part because many on the left who didn't think it went far enough see the law threatened), why people are marching in the streets to protest the new president and even why Trump won in the first place. Relative deprivation is the primary force driving political rebellion, as political scientist Theodore Gurr theorized in his 1970 book Why Men Rebel. That gap \u2014 between what people think they should get and what they think they will realistically get \u2014 creates discontent, he writes, and that discontent \"is the basic, instigating condition for participants in collective violence.\" When restaurant-employee advocate Saru Jayaraman told the Washington Post about the pain workers feel when they lose existing benefits, she was talking about this type of discontent. \"Very few restaurant workers before the ACA had anything at all,\" she says. \"When you have [insurance], then you start to deal and treat things that have been a problem for a very long time. When you cut it off, it's almost worse\" than never having insurance at all. The newfound acceptance of Obamacare isn't quite \"collective violence,\" of course. But it is a remarkable change of heart around a much-maligned policy. The Times' Sanger-Katz and Park point out that the demographics of who, exactly, is upset about the potential for repeal say a lot about why they are upset. Support for the law has grown across many subgroups, but the largest movements appear to be in Democratic-leaning groups. Those people may not have loved Obamacare, but they worry more about its repeal. Suddenly, the fear of losing Obamacare has grown big enough to trump ambivalence about the law. Relative deprivation was a major strategy for Trump It's maybe not the most mind-blowing of theories \u2014 threaten to take something away from people that they think should be theirs, and they get mad. But it is an elegant explanation for so much of the turmoil of the current political climate, when many groups seem to fear they could be losing out on what they once had. Emily Kalah Gade invoked the idea of relative deprivation this week at the Washington Post's Monkey Cage, explaining why she thinks the Women's March had such strong appeal: People took to the streets on Saturday not because of new issues, but because values and protections they thought they could safely rely upon were under threat. The sense of impending loss of power has been simmering for years among particular demographics. For example, some white men \u2014 especially those who have lost economic clout \u2014 have felt this way for years, as sociologist Michael Kimmel observed in his 2013 book Angry White Men. \"Revolutions are made not by those with 'nothing left to lose,'... but precisely by those with something to lose \u2014 and a fear that they are, in fact, about to lose it,\" he wrote. Again, that book was written in 2013, two years before Trump ran for the presidency. But Kimmel argues that idea plays a big part in explaining how Trump won the presidency in the first place. Trump again and again drew attention to disappearing goods-producing jobs in auto factories and coal mines, saying that with his help, America could regain those lost opportunities. \"These guys, their fathers, their grandfathers, their great-grandfathers, they all made a bet. The bet was, 'If I take this job in heavy industry, in the steel mill, auto factory, I can buy a house; I can support a family,'\" Kimmel told NPR in late 2016. \"These guys, they made the same bet that their fathers and grandfathers made, and they lost the bet,\" as they watched those mills and factories close, he continued. Indeed, Trump's entire campaign was about bringing back a theoretical, fading, \"great\" America. Relative deprivation is also behind the recent protests Now that Trump has won, entire other classes of people feel threatened and are taking to the streets, as Gade points out. Many at the Women's March, for example, voiced a fear that women might lose the ability to obtain abortions, as well as a more amorphous fear of losing respect and social standing they have gained over time. Many women felt a real threat in the fact that America chose a president who had, at one point, bragged about groping and kissing women. Likewise, many immigrants and Muslims are speaking out against Trump's executive action banning travel from seven Muslim-majority countries, and many also turned out at protests against the ban. This is not to say that people protest only for their own personal good. It's entirely true that many, many people in the streets are protesting on behalf of others. Many non-Muslims and non-immigrants are out protesting the ban on travel from majority-Muslim countries, for example, and plenty of men showed up for women's marches worldwide \u2014 because their moral foundation of what they believe America is supposed to be is being threatened. It's also worth observing that the protests aren't just about women and immigrants; many have also been about (large-D) Democratic politics. The recent protester cries of, \"Do your job!\" at Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer and House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi were the cries of liberals begging sympathetic legislators to seize whatever meager power they still have. The left isn't 100 percent unified, but the power of relative deprivation has helped more or less bridge what was one of the bitterest political divides \u2014 between many Bernie Sanders and Hillary Clinton supporters. After Democrats lost a presidential election (plus some Senate and House races) that almost every forecaster saw as a likely win, the divided party suddenly seemed to come together, as one organizer of the women's march told CNN. \"We have already proven that Hillary and Bernie Sanders supporters can work together against fascism, xenophobia and racism,\" said Linda Sarsour, executive director of the Arab American Association of New York. Nothing unites, it seems, like the sense of vulnerability that comes from a blistering defeat. Who can wield it better? Relative deprivation is all about two things: expectations and whether they can be met. And all politicians play the expectations game \u2014 they make promises, then try to deliver on them. However, much of Trump's political success is arguably because he plays this game so well and so heavily. He continually tells people that they are unjustly ignored (America's \"forgotten men and women\") or missing out on what they once had (\"All of the men, we're petrified to speak to women anymore\"). It was a campaign built on the narrative of being an outsider, punching up at the people in power (nevermind that he's a billionaire himself). Now, he's in power, and the question is whether Trump can deliver on expectations. He has had an action-packed first two weeks with his travel ban, promise to build a wall and rollback of regulations. He even has made moves to show that he's bringing back a handful of those lost goods-producing jobs. But four years is a long time. If some of those who supported him don't see their own personal economic prospects improve, they could jump ship. The same goes for the suddenly more-popular Obamacare: Trump at one point raised expectations that he would make sure there was \"insurance for everybody\" (though his fellow Republicans worked to tamp that down afterward). Now, he and his party have to deliver, one way or another, or they could face the anger of a country whose expectations have changed since the law was passed.",

Dictionary.com says that \"complicit\" is its word of the year for 2017, citing its new relevance in politics and social commentary.\n                \n                    \n                    AP\n                    \n                \nhide caption A screen shot provided by Dictionary.com shows the word \"complicit,\" on its website. Dictionary.com says that \"complicit\" is its word of the year for 2017, citing its new relevance in politics and social commentary. Dictionary.com has selected \"complicit\" as its word of the year for 2017, citing the term's renewed relevance in U.S. culture and politics \u2014 and noting that a refusal to be complicit has also been \"a grounding force of 2017.\" The website defines \"complicit\" as \"choosing to be involved in an illegal or questionable act, especially with others; having complicity.\" Interest in the word spiked several times this year, Dictionary.com says \u2014 most notably when Ivanka Trump said in April, \"I don't know what it means to be complicit.\" That remark came weeks after Saturday Night Live aired a segment in which Scarlett Johansson portrayed President Trump's daughter in a skit to tout a luxury fragrance called Complicit. Its tagline: \"The fragrance for the woman who could stop all this, but won't.\" The term spiked a third time, Dictionary.com says, after Sen. Jeff Flake, R-Ariz., announced in October that he won't seek re-election to Congress, citing a \"flagrant disregard for truth or decency\" in the Trump administration. \"It is time for our complicity and our accommodation of the unacceptable to end,\" Flake told his fellow Republicans. While those headline-grabbing mentions helped drive interest in and use of the term in the political arena, Dictionary.com says complicity also lurked behind many of the biggest stories of 2017. As examples, it listed humanity's role in contributing to climate change, the normalizing of hate speech and supremacist groups, and the tacit enabling of sexual harassment. Referring to the spate of allegations of sexual assault and harassment against Hollywood producer Harvey Weinstein and a number of other high-profile men, Dictionary.com says, \"These powerful men could not have harmed so many people for so many years without the complicity of their associates and the established practice of 'turning a blind eye' to misconduct.\" The choice for the word of 2017 made us curious to see how much more prevalent the word has become in NPR's coverage. A Google search for \"complicit\" on NPR.org returned 142 results from Jan. 1 through Nov. 27, 2017, compared with 75 results for the same period in 2016. A search of our audio archives found the word in 51 NPR transcripts, compared with 33 results during the same time period in 2016. Choosing a word of the year is always an attempt to capture the zeitgeist. In the case of complicity in 2017, the site says, \"It's a word that reminds us that even inaction is a type of action. The silent acceptance of wrongdoing is how we've gotten to this point.\" But the site also highlighted instances of action, and refusals to accept reprehensible or questionable conditions. It cited Sen. Flake's stand as an example of that trend; it also noted the international Women's March that took place in January, and the use of the hashtag #metoo to raise awareness of sexual assault and harassment. In 2016, Dictionary.com's word of the year was xenophobia, citing a surge in interest from users both in the U.S. and around the world.",

Jeff Flake, R-Ariz., (center) attends a luncheon with other GOP senators and President Trump on July 19 at the White House. Sen. Jeff Flake, R-Ariz., chose a dramatic moment to question the direction of his party. Flake, a longtime critic of President Trump, has written a book detailing where he thinks his party has gone wrong. \"I'm not blaming this lack of principle, or where we are, solely on the president. He's more the culmination of it,\" Flake says. Flake never endorsed his party's presidential candidate. He has praised many of Trump's appointments but is dismayed by his policies. Now he's preparing to campaign for re-election in 2018 amid talk that the president would like someone to challenge Flake in a primary. During this time he's been critiquing the president, Flake has written Conscience of a Conservative: A Rejection of Destructive Politics and a Return to Principle, a book he says he wrote in secret. Even his staff didn't know until recently. It carries a provocative title, borrowed from another book, which was written by Sen. Barry Goldwater, R-Ariz., generations ago. It had been more than five decades since Goldwater concluded that the GOP had been, Flake says, \"compromised\" by big, New Deal-era federal bureaucracy and was moving away from the principles of limited government. It was time to reassess, he says. \"I'm very troubled about where the Republican Party is now. It seems that we've been compromised, but this time by different forces \u2014 those of populism and protectionism, isolationism, xenophobia and I'm concerned about how we remain a governing party with those principles,\" he says. On what went wrong This is a long time in coming. I got here in Washington in 2001. ... And we got [President George W. Bush's education overhaul law] No Child Left Behind, which was, I thought, big federal overreach into local education policy. And then we got the prescription drug benefit, which added about $7 trillion in unfunded liabilities. I didn't think that was a very conservative thing to do. by Jeff Flake Hardcover, 160 pages | Your purchase helps support NPR programming. How? When we couldn't argue that we were the party of limited government anymore, then that forced us into issues like flag burning or trying to intervene in the Terri Schiavo case, things that we wouldn't have done otherwise if we would have been arguing about true principles of limited government or spending. On how that sowed the seeds for the rise of President Trump I do think that we made the ground fertile for somebody like President Trump to come along, and I think that now we've abandoned many of our principles \u2014 like free trade and American leadership around the world \u2014 but also we've become a coarser party. Being a conservative isn't just adopting conservative policies. I think it matters in terms of demeanor and comportment. I certainly recognize the frustrations that people have. I feel and hear it every day. ... People are concerned about their jobs, their economic future. They wonder if their kids will have the same economic opportunities that they've had, and I think Donald Trump kind of spoke to that. But I think as conservatives, our first obligation is to be honest with people and telling factory workers for example \u2014 it's always easier for a politician to point to a shuttered factory and say \"That's because of free trade. That's because Mexico took those jobs, or China did.\" But what is not recognized is that it's largely been productivity gains and automation. We manufacture twice as much as we did in the 1980s with one-third fewer workers and those productivity gains will continue. Globalization has happened and the question is: Do we harness it for our benefit or are we left behind by it? On why he wrote the book in secret I have good people around me who are committed to principle, but the political world will tell you keep quiet, don't take a risk [when you're up for re-election] and I thought that it was important to stand up when I had something to risk. I think it means more at that point. Morning Edition editor Arezou Rezvani and producer Barton Girdwood and Digital News producer Heidi Glenn contributed to this story.",

A confident Marine Le Pen strides into a room in her new campaign headquarters, greeting reporters in her signature, husky voice. The candidate takes a seat in front of a calming blue campaign poster that bears no mention of the National Front party or the Le Pen surname. It says simply, \"IN THE NAME OF THE PEOPLE: Marine \u2013 President.\" \"This isn't just a slogan,\" she says. \"It's a profession of my beliefs. I would never betray the people. It's unbearable to see the people betrayed time and again by politicians who don't keep their promises and by the technocrats at the European Union.\" Marine Le Pen speaks to reporters in her campaign headquarters.\n                \n                    \n                    Eleanor Beardsley/NPR\n                    \n                \nhide caption Marine Le Pen speaks to reporters in her campaign headquarters. Le Pen took over leadership of the National Front six years ago. Her father, Jean-Marie Le Pen, founded the party in 1972 and was known for his xenophobia and anti-Semitism. His daughter is trying to make the National Front more palatable to mainstream voters by abandoning that rhetoric. Le Pen's strategy has paid off at the polls. The party has become one of the most successful in France, attracting younger voters and more women. And people who've never voted for the far right in their life. That describes 74-year-old Jacqueline Castanaer in the Mediterranean port city of Nice, who says the surge in immigration the past few years has become too much. \"They pass illegally over the border from Italy,\" Castanaer says. \"I think Le Pen could come in and clean things up a bit. And it would be good to close the borders. The left and right just go back and forth in this country but nothing ever changes.\" Le Pen says as president the first thing she'll do is seek a return of French sovereignty over its borders, currency and laws. If need be, with a referendum to leave the EU, which she calls an undemocratic organization that advances by threats and blackmail. She says Brexit and the election of U.S. President Donald Trump show that the people are not going to lie back and take it anymore. \"The people are rejecting so-called free trade and globalization that the elites presented as a positive thing,\" she says. \"But it's actually causing massive migration and the collapse of industries.\" Speaking to cheering crowds at a gathering of the European far-right last weekend in Koblenz, Germany, Le Pen said she would close French borders. She said the current wave of illegal migrants is in addition to the 200,000 legal immigrants France has been accepting every year for the last decade. The crowds yelled in agreement when she said it was time to end mass immigration. \"Immigration has a huge cost on social programs and it lowers salaries and drives up unemployment,\" said Le Pen. \"It's also a source of insecurity. We know there are terrorists hiding among the waves of migrants, so how much longer are we going to continue on like this?\" Though Le Pen calls Islamic fundamentalism one of the biggest dangers facing France, she says she is not anti-Muslim. Le Pen says there are two kinds of Islam and one is completely compatible with French values. \"Practicing Muslims, like Christians and Jews, have never posed a threat to French values,\" she says. \"But there's another political fundamentalist, totalitarian Islam that wants sharia [Islamic] law over French law. And this is the one I will fight without mercy.\" Le Pen has made no secret of her admiration for Russian President Vladimir Putin. She says he always has the interests of Russia and the Russian people in mind, which is the way it should be. Le Pen supported Russia's annexation of Crimea after what she called a legitimate referendum. Le Pen says the insurrection in eastern Ukraine is entirely Europe's fault, because the EU tried to blackmail Ukraine with a commercial deal in order to force it to break ties with Russia. \"The EU \u2013 probably on instructions from the U.S. \u2013 created the conditions for this coup d'etat and completely artificial conflict,\" says Le Pen. Le Pen says she's very pleased that there will no doubt be an easing of tensions between the U.S. and Russia with President Trump in office. \"If only for selfish reasons - because we're in the middle,\" she says laughing. Le Pen calls for a multi-polar world. She says France should be under no other nation's control, as she says it is now with regard to the U.S. and NATO. Le Pen says she will take France out of NATO's central command if elected. As for President Trump? Le Pen says his policies are good for France. \"He scrapped the transatlantic trade deal and he's against the U.S. playing the role of the world's policeman. Lord knows we've all been paying the price for that these last years.\" But not everything is going Le Pen's way. She's had to adapt her campaign to some unforeseen events. Fran\u00e7ois Hollande, the unpopular Socialist president, is not seeking a second term. And a social conservative, Fran\u00e7ois Fillon, is the surprise choice as presidential candidate of the mainstream right. Fillon's support of traditional, Catholic values could attract many of the voters Le Pen had been counting on. Jean-Yves Camus, with the French Institute for Strategic and International Affairs, says Le Pen is now adopting Trump's tactics. \"She's going to the left on the economy and social issues,\" he says. \"That is, explaining to the workers that globalization is bad, that the EU is bad.\" Camus says the platform of the far left and the far right are practically identical except on immigration. Le Pen says the labels left and right don't mean anything anymore. Today's split is between those who support global organizations and open borders, and those who want strong nation states. \"I see the great return of sovereign nations with their borders, protections and patriotism,\" she says. For Marine Le Pen, Brexit and the election of Trump herald the beginning of a new era. French voters will decide if that's true when they go to the polls in April.",

            "article_content": "Dozens of Women's Marches took place across the U.S. and the world Saturday on President Trump's first full day in office.  LOURDES GARCIA-NAVARRO, HOST: Protesters filled the streets in cities around the country and the world on President Donald Trump's first full day in office. Some demonstrators who traveled to the Women's March on Washington are now heading home, and many participants are wondering what's next. NPR's Hansi Lo Wang reports. HANSI LO WANG, BYLINE: Their voices echoed across the U.S., from New York City... (SOUNDBITE OF PROTEST) UNIDENTIFIED PROTESTERS: (Chanting) We go high when they go low. WANG: ...To Park City, Utah... (SOUNDBITE OF PROTEST) UNIDENTIFIED PROTESTERS: (Chanting) Love, not hate, makes America great. Love, not hate... WANG: ...And Sioux Falls, S.D. (SOUNDBITE OF PROTEST) UNIDENTIFIED PROTESTERS: (Chanting) Native lives matter. Native lives matter. WANG: For some, the Women's Marches were their first steps into activism, including Felipe Ortiz who attended a rally in Wichita, Kan. FELIPE ORTIZ: I'm 82 years old, and I'm going for my first long walk for all the women. I won't be here forever, but I'm helping. WANG: In New York, city officials estimate that more than 400,000 protesters came out for Saturday's march. Amy Mitchell was in the crowd and said she and others were standing up against President Donald Trump. AMY MITCHELL: I think he's bringing people together in a way that he may not have expected. And if we can all come together, maybe it will only be one term - hopefully. WANG: Anti-Trump messages also dominated the Women's March in Washington, D.C., which drew some of the biggest names of the feminist movement, including Gloria Steinem. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) GLORIA STEINEM: We are here and around the world for a deep democracy that says we will not be quiet, we will not be controlled, we will work for a world in which all countries are connected. God may be in the details, but the goddess is in connections. WANG: In D.C., the crowd appeared to be mostly white. Some critics of the Women's March say the organizers failed to fully connect with women of color, even after diversifying the leadership team and broadening policy demands. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) ROSLYN BROCK: The silence in America has been deafening for black women and our families, who also feel forgotten and blocked out of a prosperous society. WANG: Roslyn Brock is the chair of the National Board of Directors at the NAACP. Her speech to the D.C. crowd touched on the history of women of color often being left behind by the women's suffrage movement. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) BROCK: And so I call upon you, my sisters, in the words of my ancestral she-ro (ph) Sojourner Truth - ain't I a woman? (CHEERING) WANG: The marches did bring out many families. Thirty-one-year-old Kristina Apgar of Brooklyn, N.Y., came to Washington with her mother and younger sister. KRISTINA APGAR: I would be here no matter what by myself. But the fact that my mom and my sister are here - it means so much more that we're all now proudly feminists. WANG: Apgar's mother, Ruth, said her main concern is Republican lawmakers cutting funding for Planned Parenthood. RUTH APGAR: That's where we went for the medical advice and, quite frankly, birth control. I mean, I came from a middle-class area, but my parents wouldn't talk about that sort of thing. And women today are still using it. And for them to cut the funding, that's outrageous. WANG: The marches can be an effective way to start a broader campaign, according to Nandini Deo, who studies social movements at Lehigh University in Pennsylvania. NANDINI DEO: It helps all of us, you know, connect with each other, realize there's a lot of us out there. It helps us become more firm in our identity as activists. WANG: Deo took a bus herself from Philadelphia to D.C. with her husband and two sons, plus some friends and neighbors. But she says what really matters is what protesters decide to do after the marches. DEO: People's energies can get channeled in lots of different directions. So how do you keep everyone together? WANG: Deo says she plans to get more involved with congressional elections to support progressive candidates. It's a localized strategy that many marchers say they're ready to take on.

            "article_content": "1 of 11 Updated at 4 p.m. ET The National Mall has flooded with pink, as demonstrators descend on the nation's capital Saturday for the Women's March on Washington. Just one day after President Trump's inauguration, marchers from across the country have gathered in the city to protest his agenda and support for women's rights. The event opened with a rally, to be followed by the march proper \u2014 which had a path laid out from a starting position near the U.S. Capitol to its endpoint near the Washington Monument. The city's metro system reported 275,000 rides as of 11 a.m. According to metro officials that's eight times more than a normal Saturday. Reuters adds that the number is also \"82,000 more than the 193,000 rides reported at the same point on Friday,\" the day of Trump's inauguration. Chris and Susannah Kisrarday traveled to D.C. from Lewisburg, Pa., with their kids Zoitan, Ceili, Catherine and Ellie.

By the time marchers hit the streets, the Women's March on Washington developed a broad platform of progressive political positions, a slate of celebrity performers and a series of sister marches planned across the world \u2014 on all seven continents. Many protesters wore pink or other feminist iconography at the Women's March on Washington.\n                \n                    \n                    Meg Kelly/NPR\n                    \n                \nhide caption For protester Amy Jackson, though, the matter was simple: She just wanted to \"make her voice heard,\" she tells NPR's Marisa Penaloza. Jackson, who traveled to D.C. from Chocowinity, N.C., to be part of the march, said, \"It was very important to be here today.\" Among the crowd that gathered for the rally outside the National Museum of the American Indian, NPR's Sarah McCammon reported signs supporting a wide array of causes \u2014 from women's rights and LGBTQ rights, to Black Lives Matter and excoriations of xenophobia. One thing seemed to be almost universal, though: The pink knitted caps known as \"pussyhats\" among the marchers, in protest of Trump's past comments about women. (Left to right) Melissa Breen, Laura Jamison, Sandy Cuza and Kathryn Wehrmann chat while sporting matching pink hats in support of the march.\n                \n                    \n                    Becky Harlan/NPR\n                    \n                \nhide caption Popular as they may have been, the pussyhats were not the only costume worn by marchers. Others wore their causes on their sleeves, dressing in attire to call attention to issues like Native rights and environmental fears. In video Sarah recorded a block or two from the main rally, it appears there were marchers in a menagerie of outfits. Credit:  Sarah McCammon/NPR Meanwhile, at a nearby metro station, NPR's Pam Fessler reported the mood among the demonstrators has been more festive than protests Friday. Most of the demonstrators are women, Pam says, but some men have joined the march, as well \u2014 including one man carrying a sign reading: \"This is what a feminist looks like.\" From the main rally stage, musicians and speakers addressed the crowd in an event that lasted some five hours \u2014 more than two hours longer than anticipated. The reason for that overflow was partly its smattering of surprise guests. Beyond the planned performances and speeches from figures like Janelle Mon\u00e1e and Gloria Steinem, others including Madonna and Alicia Keys took the stage. \"It was woman that gave you Dr Martin Luther King Jr. It was woman who gave you Malcolm X. And according to the bible, it was a woman who gave you Jesus,\" Mon\u00e1e told the crowd, according to The Guardian. What began simply as opposition to Trump has developed a wide-ranging list of demands, which organizers published as a platform prior to the march. Protesters march near the U.S. Department of the Treasury.\n                \n                    \n                    Becky Harlan/NPR\n                    \n                \nhide caption But above all, organizers say, is the principle that \"Women's Rights are Human Rights and Human Rights are Women's Rights.\" That statement is pulled directly from a speech Hillary Clinton delivered more than two decades ago in Beijing. Clinton tweeted her support for the march Saturday, expressing thanks \"for standing, speaking & marching for our values.\" Thanks for standing, speaking & marching for our values @womensmarch. Important as ever. I truly believe we're always Stronger Together. Arriving at that platform was not always a smooth process, though. NPR's Hansi Lo Wang reports there has been disagreement between organizers about how to treat issues of race. \"This march was initially put together by white women, and a lot of women of color felt they weren't part of the conversation,\" Carmen Perez, one of the march's national organizers, told NPR's Hansi Lo Wang. \"We can't continue to work in isolation. We can't continue to be one-dimensional. We have to make sure that we look up, that we begin to really coordinate our efforts.\" (Left to right) Nadia da Rosa, 15, from Providence, R.I.; Anna Maria Evans from Durham, N.C.; and Nicole Monceaux from New York City attend the Women's March on Washington in D.C.\n                \n                    \n                    Sait Serkan Gurbuz/AP\n                    \n                \nhide caption Ultimately, more than 200 organizations \u2014 ranging from Planned Parenthood and the NAACP, to Amnesty International and the AFL-CIO \u2014 partnered with the Women's March on Washington. For Darcy Sawatzki, a demonstrator attending the march with her daughter, Delia, what matters most is showing up. \"I think showing up and paying attention is sort of one of the bare minimums of citizenship,\" Sawatzki told NPR's Brakkton Booker. It's not her first march; she has also participated in Black Lives Matter protests. Sarah and her mom, Tamara, traveled from Detroit to be at the Women's March on Washington.\n                \n                    \n                    Meg Kelly/NPR\n                    \n                \nhide caption Sarah and her mom, Tamara, traveled from Detroit to be at the Women's March on Washington.

            "article_content": "President Trump said Tuesday anti-Semitic violence is \"horrible\" and more work needs to be done to root out bigotry. His comments came after criticism that he hasn't spoken out against anti-Semitism.  ARI SHAPIRO, HOST: When President Trump has been given the opportunity to talk about anti-Semitism, he has sidestepped the issue multiple times until today, as NPR's Tamara Keith reports TAMARA KEITH, BYLINE: In the president's first week in office, his administration released a statement on Holocaust Remembrance Day that didn't mention the Jewish people, 6 million of whom were killed in the Holocaust. Press Secretary Sean Spicer defended this statement, saying a staffer who is the descendant of Holocaust survivors helped write it. (SOUNDBITE OF PRESS CONFERENCE) SEAN SPICER: To suggest that remembering the Holocaust and acknowledging all of the people - Jewish, gypsies, priest, disabled, gays and lesbians - I mean it's frank - it is pathetic that people are picking on a statement. KEITH: That explanation didn't satisfy many in the Jewish community who said the statement risked giving comfort to Holocaust deniers trying to erase Jewish suffering from the Holocaust. Then last week with the Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, at the president's side, an Israeli reporter asked Trump about a rise in anti-Semitic incidents across the United States during the campaign and following his election victory. (SOUNDBITE OF PRESS CONFERENCE) UNIDENTIFIED REPORTER: And I wonder. What do you say to those among the Jewish community in the States and in Israel and maybe around the world who believe and feel that your administration is playing with xenophobia and maybe racist tones? KEITH: Trump started out by talking about how great his election victory had been. (SOUNDBITE OF PRESS CONFERENCE) PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: I just want to say that we are, you know, very honored by the victory that we had - 306 Electoral College votes. KEITH: Trump didn't directly address the anti-Semitic incidents, but he did say this. (SOUNDBITE OF PRESS CONFERENCE) TRUMP: We are going to do everything within our power to stop long-simmering racism and every other thing that's going on. KEITH: Trump then talked about his daughter Ivanka, his son-in-law Jared Kushner and their children, who are Jewish. The next day, a reporter attempted to ask Trump the question again, but he didn't really get a chance because Trump cut him off. (SOUNDBITE OF PRESS CONFERENCE) TRUMP: Number one, I am the least anti-Semitic person that you've ever seen in your entire life. Number two, racism - the least racist person. KEITH: Trump made it clear he objected to even being asked the question. (SOUNDBITE OF PRESS CONFERENCE) TRUMP: I hate the charge. I find it repulsive. KEITH: Asked again by another reporter, Trump suggested that anti-Semitic or racist vandalism may have been the fault of opponents trying to make him look bad. After that, the chorus of people calling for the president to speak out against anti-Semitism got louder even as there were more threats and vandalism. And then this morning, touring the African-American History Museum, the president made a statement. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) TRUMP: The anti-Semitic threats targeting our Jewish community and community centers are horrible and are painful and a very sad reminder of the work that still must be done to root out hate and prejudice and evil. KEITH: The Anti-Defamation League said it was pleased that the president acknowledged the seriousness of the threats. Jonathan Greenblatt is the group's CEO. JONATHAN GREENBLATT: We agree with the president that these anti-Semitic threats targeting our community are horrible and painful. As a next step, we fully hope that the administration will announce concrete measures to demonstrate that it doesn't just take these threats seriously but it's mobilizing to action. KEITH: He's calling for, among other things, the president to create a task force led by the attorney general looking at the threats. But not all Jewish organizations responded so diplomatically. The Anne Frank Center for Mutual Respect said, quote, \"the president's sudden acknowledgement is a Band-Aid on the cancer of anti-Semitism that has infected his own administration.\" Tamara Keith, NPR News, the White House.

            "article_content": "The White House is deep in the midst of a tax overhaul push. Also, we look at the damage from Hurricane Irma and Russia's investigation of a watchdog group called the SOVA Center.  DAVID GREENE, HOST: Well, there have been the Russia investigations that are still ongoing, hurricanes, North Korea, but the White House does seem now to be focusing on a big Republican agenda item. MARY LOUISE KELLY, HOST: Yeah. And that big agenda item, David, is overhauling the tax code. President Trump is going to meet with lawmakers about that today. Last night, he had dinner with a group of senators, including three Democrats, still talking about tax. So it does seem like the administration so far is taking a more aggressive approach on taxes than it did on health care. Here's White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders. (SOUNDBITE OF PRESS CONFERENCE) SARAH HUCKABEE SANDERS: The president, I think, has demonstrated, both in his business world and as president, that he can make deals. And that's certainly what he's looking to do. GREENE: NPR national political correspondent Mara Liasson is here. Good morning, Mara. MARA LIASSON, BYLINE: Good morning, David. GREENE: So the president has Democrats to dinner, which makes me wonder, is this a big new bipartisan approach that we started to hear about when the president struck that deal with, you know, Democrats Chuck Schumer and Nancy Pelosi? LIASSON: The White House says it is. GREENE: OK. LIASSON: Three Democrats came to dinner last night, along with some Republicans. But this outreach to Democrats is different than the true bipartisan approaches on tax legislation in the past. In those efforts, you'd see the Republican and Democratic leaders of the tax writing committees working on a bill together from the beginning. But this time, Democrats have been pretty much shut out of the process so far. It seems that what the administration wants to do is try to pick up a few Democratic votes, and they're targeting Democratic senators who are up for re-election next year in states that Trump won. And all three of the senators who were there last night fit that description. GREENE: OK, so he wants their votes. Do we actually know what they'd be voting for at this point? LIASSON: Good question. Only the broadest outlines of the tax plan have been revealed. The president wants to get corporate and individual rates down. He wants to get rid of some deductions. But there's still lots of divisions among Republicans and between Republicans and Democrats on how to pay for the cuts, whether to pay for the cuts, who should get the biggest benefit from the cuts - the middle class or wealthy business owners. Now, the White House and congressional leaders say details will be coming soon, possibly by the end of this week or month. They have to vote on a budget resolution first. And some House conservatives are saying they want to see the details of a tax plan before they vote on the budget. The reason they have to vote on the budget is that is the way that they can unleash something called reconciliation that will allow them to pass this with only 51 votes in the Senate instead of 60. GREENE: OK, so a really complicated process, during which you would imagine the president is going to need to try and keep that Republican caucus together in Congress, which has been no certain thing so far. What is the White House relationship right now with Republicans on the Hill? LIASSON: Well, Republicans - relationships with Republicans in Congress - a little shaky. It's not just that the president blindsided Republicans with his snap decision to make a deal with Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer last week, but also, looking ahead to 2018, the White House will not commit that the president will stay out of the primary process. In other words, he could get involved and support Republican primary challengers to Republican incumbents. GREENE: You got a hint of that in Arizona, right? I mean, when he went there. LIASSON: Yes, you certainly did. He's spoken out in favor of Kelly Ward, who wants to challenge Jeff Flake. That could have a big effect on decisions about retirements, - Republicans who are considering retirement. It could affect recruiting and fundraising. GREENE: All right. NPR national political correspondent Mara Liasson. Thanks, Mara. LIASSON: Thank you. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) GREENE: Mary Louise, I think we're getting a sense for how long a process this is going to be cleaning up after Hurricane Irma. KELLY: A very long process, David. And that is, in part, because there is so much infrastructure that's going to need to be repaired. We know that more than half of Florida lost power because of the storm. Danny Gonzales (ph) is among those still working without electricity. DANNY GONZALES: It's been a struggle for everybody here, but you know what? We're going to make it. We're helping each other. But hopefully, we'll get electrical here quick because people run out of gas and generators. KELLY: NPR's Martin Kaste ran into a crowd who were thrilled when a utility truck happened to show up in their neighborhood in Miami. Let's listen to a little bit of that reaction. UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN #1: God bless you. GERARD HOOVER: No problem. UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN #1: Welcome to Miami. HOOVER: We're glad to help you guys. We're going to try as hard as we can. UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN #1: We really appreciate it. HOOVER: OK. UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN #2: When do you think we'll get power back, like, this area? HOOVER: I'm going to say maybe by tomorrow. OK? UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN #2: OK. Yay. KELLY: (Laughter) Maybe by tomorrow. And that is what is counting as progress right there in Miami today. GREENE: Yeah. Well, Martin Kaste was there to hear all of that. Martin, it's amazing, I mean, the power guy is the most popular person in Florida right now it sounds like - if he brings good news. MARTIN KASTE, BYLINE: I should add, yeah, a power guy from Detroit. GREENE: Oh, really? They're bringing in reinforcements? KASTE: Oh, yeah. All these crews are from out of town, trying to help out, get this happening faster. GREENE: That's amazing. KASTE: Ring around a Detroit power company pickup truck. GREENE: So does it feel like things are returning to normal in Miami right now? KASTE: Yeah. I mean, normal is not here yet, but you can kind of see it off on the horizon. You know, this is a city that you start to feel the pulse sort of of everyday life quickening around you. There's more traffic. There's, you know, little traffic jams. I was in Little Havana yesterday... GREENE: And people were probably celebrating that (laughter). KASTE: Well, yeah, yes and no. I mean, you also have a lot to do - a lot to do - to try recover their normal life. And people are running around, trying to get some of that done, those who are here. So a lot of people aren't back yet, too. You know, Little Havana, there were all these neat piles of debris on the curb. A couple of kids had a table set up on the side of the street selling avocados that had blown off trees, you know, two for a dollar, that kind of thing. So, you know, it's - you see life coming back for sure. GREENE: And what about the electricity? I mean, how long could this be for people who still don't have power? KASTE: Well, you know, as I say, they've got crews from out of state here. They're hitting this pretty hard. But the real problem is, you know, the neighborhoods that have, you know, those leafy aspects, places like Coral Gables, where that tape came from, with lots of trees, lots of big, old trees. You know, it's a real, real mess. You know, there's streets you can't even drive down yet still. The chainsaws are going everywhere, a lot of trees down on the wires. And so that could take a lot longer in some of those places, especially to kind of get that last mile or that last block. So that's kind of going to be tough for some sections of town for a while. GREENE: And what about security? Are people feeling safe in the city right now? KASTE: Well, we've heard about some attempts at looting. The police were talking about that yesterday, some people trying to be opportunistic. But there is, I think, probably a sense here that, you know, when you step back, crime itself probably isn't up and may even be down, given how many people are not around. It's eerie if you're in a neighborhood without any lights right now. You know, it gets dark. It gets, you know, it's just you and maybe the lights of the police car going by and then darkness again. But there's a sense, I think, that it's not so much dangerous as it's kind of creepy. And people want some of that light and some of that normalcy to come back. GREENE: Well, hopefully it'll be coming back soon for the people of Miami. NPR's Martin Kaste giving us an update from that city after the hurricane. Thanks a lot, Martin. KASTE: You're welcome. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) GREENE: We're trying to figure out this morning why Russia is cracking down on a hate crime watchdog group. KELLY: This is a group called the SOVA Center. And they are being scrutinized for having once had ties to two American organizations, organizations considered undesirable in Russia. They are the National Endowment for Democracy and the Soros Foundation - think billionaire financier George Soros. The director of SOVA is named Alexander Verkhovsky, and he says these charges have wider implications. ALEXANDER VERKHOVSKY: It's about everything. If you put a link to something which isn't illegal and you may be punished for that, it's opened the Pandora box. GREENE: Well, let's go to Moscow now and our correspondent there, Lucian Kim, who caught up with Verkhovsky and is going to help us understand this. Hey there, Lucian. LUCIAN KIM, BYLINE: Good morning. GREENE: So what does this organization do? And what are they being accused of here? KIM: Well, the word sova in Russian means owl. And this group sees itself as a think tank, as a research group that monitors hate crimes and xenophobia. But like a lot of other NGOs, they receive significant foreign funding, and that makes them vulnerable in the current political climate. In this specific case, they're being accused of publishing hyperlinks, as you mentioned, to past donors. So this has actually happened several years ago. The Russian government now considers those organizations undesirable. And it's illegal to disseminate information about those groups. Verkhovsky, for his part, just compares those hyperlinks to, you know, footnotes in an academic research paper. He says they have nothing to hide. It's something that happened in the past, and they're just being transparent. He says they removed links immediately, but still, both his organization and he personally now face charges. GREENE: So what could happen now, if we're talking about charges? KIM: Well, right now, they're just waiting to go before a judge. They're waiting for the court date. He told me that the worst that could happen to them are fines. They could add up to $3,000. For a small NGO in Russia, that's a lot of money. You know, they work out of a couple of rooms in a basement, where I went yesterday. And moreover, what Verkhovsky told me was the problem is they're going to be spending scarce resources in preparing their legal case instead of doing their real work. And so after the entire appeal process, they could end up, you know, in six separate court cases. GREENE: Is this a part of a bigger crackdown on civil society right now in Russia? KIM: Well, Russian NGOs have been saying for the past five years, since massive anti-government protests, that it's already become a lot more difficult for them to work because of new legislation. I did put it to Verkhovsky. I asked him if he thinks this is a new crackdown. He says he's still not sure. He doesn't know if this is directed exactly against his organization or if this is the beginning of a bigger campaign, you know, against anyone and any group that happens to post a hyperlink to a so-called undesirable organization. And that's why, you know, he called it in the quote that you just played, you know, opening a Pandora's box. GREENE: All right. NPR's Lucian Kim, NPR's Moscow correspondent. Lucian, thanks. KIM: Thanks, David. (SOUNDBITE OF LAZERBEAK'S \"MIGHTY JUNGLE\") Copyright \u00a9 2017 NPR.  All rights reserved.

            "article_content": "Women's marches are being held across the country, including in Raleigh, N.C. NPR's Scott Simon talks to Jess Clark of member station WUNC.  SCOTT SIMON, HOST: In addition to the main demonstration in Washington, D.C., there are other marches happening across the country and outside of the United States, Boston, Chicago, St. Louis, Indianapolis, Los Angeles, Austin, Seattle, London, Sydney and more. We go now to Raleigh, N.C., where Jess Clark of member station WUNC joins us. Jess, thanks for being with us. JESS CLARK, BYLINE: Yeah, no problem. SIMON: What's the day been like in Raleigh? CLARK: Well, there have been a lot of people here - a lot of people - I would say definitely several thousands. The march started around 10:30 in the morning. And police had planned for it to be a sidewalk march, actually, where the crowds would only take up the sidewalk. But by noon, there were still people filling up all lanes of traffic, pouring into the main Moore Square, filling up that green space. So definitely several thousand people - just a lot of - like, huge crowds. SIMON: Yeah. And like in substantially larger cities, this is a much larger crowd than, I guess, what local authorities and police officials had been expecting, wasn't it? CLARK: Yes. Yes. Definitely, yeah. As I said, they planned for just the sidewalk march. And so they hadn't planned to block off - looks like they didn't really plan to block off enough streets. And so you had backed-up traffic. And there was actually buses that were trying to come through to use the bus stop here on one of the main streets. And they couldn't get to the bus stop because there were so many people. SIMON: Tell us about some of the conversations you've been having, who you've been talking to, what they've been telling you. CLARK: Yeah. Well, I think there - people are here with a lot of different issues that they care about. And, you know, there's definitely a lot of concern about reproductive rights. I talked to one woman who is a nurse in labor and delivery. And she was there. She had a big sign that had - you know, had the words don't touch my uterus on it and a big drawing of a uterus. And she is very worried about what a Trump administration might mean for reproductive rights and the right for women to choose to have an abortion. There were also a lot of people that were worried about xenophobia. I talked to a woman named Vivian who is Columbian-American. Her father came over and was undocumented for a while. And she worries about other undocumented people who may have a lot of fear about the election of Donald Trump. So just a wide variety of issues. SIMON: Jess, I know this puts you on the spot, but why did this march get so much bigger than what people had thought? Any idea based on what you heard from people? CLARK: Well, I'm not really sure. I mean, I think Facebook, obviously, has, you know, a big reach. But, also, North Carolina has a pretty active protest scene right now. It's a state that has a Republican-led legislature that has enacted a lot of policies that places where you have a lot more Democratic, liberal-leaning populations really take issue with - for example, some of the voting restrictions that were passed in 2013. So there is kind of, like, already a grass-roots, really large, very organized network of people who are already politically active. So I think that might have something to do with it. SIMON: Jess Clark, reporter for WUNC in Raleigh. Thanks very much for being with us, Jess. CLARK: Thank you. Copyright \u00a9 2017 NPR.  All rights reserved.

            "article_content": "The Apostolic Palace is the traditional residence of the Pope inside Vatican City, but Pope Francis chose not to live there. President Trump will meet with the Pope later this week.  MICHEL MARTIN, HOST: Now to the Vatican for our feature Words You'll Hear. That's where we try to understand some of the stories we'll be hearing more about in the coming days by parsing a word or phrase connected with the story. Today, we'll talk about the Apostolic Palace. That refers to the pope's grand official residence in Vatican City. It's the location of a much anticipated meeting between Pope Francis and President Donald Trump on Wednesday. But the fact is that the pope doesn't even live there, and that offers a telling contrast with his visitor. NPR's Tom Gjelten is going to tell us why and why that might matter. He reports on religion and belief.  Tom, thanks so much for joining us. TOM GJELTEN, BYLINE: Of course, Michel. MARTIN: So what more can you tell us about the Apostolic Palace? It really is a palace, right? GJELTEN: Well, it's a series of buildings. This is the heart of Vatican City. It was built in the 1800s, took almost a hundred years to build, huge and ornate, a complex of buildings and chapels, the most famous of which is the Sistine Chapel, the ceiling fresco there of course was painted by Michelangelo. But it's actually full of famous frescoes painted by Renaissance painters. There are meeting rooms, Vatican offices and very fancy apartments where popes have traditionally lived, but not Pope Francis, as you say. He considered the Apostolic Palace way too fancy for him. Remember how humble he is as a pope. He insisted on moving into a much more modest guesthouse, and that's in keeping with this style that he has as a humble person. And - but, yes, this is where he's going to be meeting with President Trump next Wednesday. Very few people would say that President Trump is himself a humble person. MARTIN: Well, we'll talk a little bit more about that. We have two of the world's most recognizable leaders going into this meeting. What has been their history going up to this? GJELTEN: It's been a difficult history, as you know, Michel. I mean, the pope as a leader of Christians feels very strongly about the Christian duty to welcome the stranger. He's been an outspoken advocate for immigrants and refugees, and with respect to Trump, who has not exactly been an outspoken advocate for immigrants and refugees, the pope has been very critical. In February of 2016, the pope told reporters that, quote - referring obliquely to Donald Trump - \"a person who only thinks about building walls wherever they may be and not building bridges is not a Christian.\" And, of course, Trump did not take well to that. He thought what the pope said was disgraceful, and then he came out with this somewhat bombastic warning to the Vatican about what it should see as being at stake in the 2016 election. Listen to this. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: If and when the Vatican is attacked by ISIS, which as everyone knows is ISIS's ultimate trophy, I can promise you that the pope would have only wished and prayed that Donald Trump would have been president because this would not have happened. ISIS would have been eradicated, unlike what is happening now with our all-talk-no-action politicians. GJELTEN: So, Michel, as far as building walls versus building bridges are concerned, there is definitely some bridge building that needs to be done in this meeting. MARTIN: So that was during the campaign. GJELTEN: Right. MARTIN: What about since then? GJELTEN: They've actually not even spoken since Donald Trump took office. This is going to be their first conversation. But if anything, the pope's criticism has intensified in these months. He has repeated his implicit criticism of Trump's focus on the border wall. He, at one point, urged Catholics, quote, \"to not raise walls but bridges\" - going back to that obsession that he has with bridges. And then he went on to say a Christian can never say I'll make you pay for that. That sounded to me like it was aimed squarely at Trump. He's also been highly critical of what he calls xenophobia and the nationalistic populist message that is reverberating in Europe as well as in the U.S. And, of course, that message is very much associated with Donald Trump. MARTIN: Did the two have other disagreements apart from these issues? GJELTEN: Yeah. I mean, the pope is very outspoken, again, in favor of action to alleviate climate change. He put out two years ago a very important environment encyclical in which he said that humans are responsible for global warming and need to take action. He also is, again, a very outspoken critic of the death penalty, and he says that governments need to help the poor. So there are a lot of ideological differences between these two people. But I would go back to say that the biggest difference is one of style, the humility of Pope Francis versus the - sort of the egotism and extravagance of Donald Trump. MARTIN: Well, we've talked about where the two have clashed. Are there areas in which they have common ground? GJELTEN: Well, Michel, President Trump has staked out a pretty strong anti-abortion position. That's going to resonate with Catholic leaders. But here's one interesting thing that they have in common. Pope Francis and President Trump both value personal relationships. Trump has always talked about how important in dealing with foreign leaders, how important it is to establish a good personal relationship very close to what Pope Francis says, so they may both really want to emphasize their development of a personal relationship.

            "article_content": "The first round of the French presidential campaign has left voters with a stark choice in May's runoff between the centrist Emmanuel Macron and the far-right candidate Marine Le Pen.  AUDIE CORNISH, HOST: Voters in France have upended the political order there. Newcomer Emmanuel Macron beat 10 other candidates yesterday to win a landmark victory in the first round of the French presidential election. Far-right candidate Marine Le Pen came in second. Now the two will meet in a runoff in a couple of weeks that will be watched around the world. Neither represents what have been until now France's major political parties. Macron is the current favorite, but to ensure a clear victory, he has to pick up millions of votes from people who did not support him in the first round. Now, for more on the sprint to this May 7 runoff, we turn to Frank Langfitt in Paris. And Frank, how hard is it going to be to pick up these new voters given the way the electorate was split? FRANK LANGFITT, BYLINE: Well, you know, Macron, first of all, has a lot going for him. Candidates from other major parties that lost yesterday, the Republicans and the Socialists - they urged their voters to back Macron to stop Le Pen, and that's because Le Pen is really deeply polarizing here. She's an anti-immigration candidate, anti-globalization. Many people would say they find her policies xenophobic, and analysts would even say that maybe Macron's biggest advantage right now is that he isn't Marine Le Pen. CORNISH: You've given him a lot of advantages here. What are the challenges he's facing? LANGFITT: Well, a lot. Macron's never held elective office before. He started his party just last year. He's a centrist with a pretty vague platform. And so I was out on the streets of Paris today, talking to potential voters, and I heard, you know, a lot of skepticism from people, had this interesting exchange in the 16th arrondissement. It's a very wealthy area. And I was talking to a travel agency manager. Her name is Evelyne Birot. And in the first round, she voted for Francois Fillon. He's a mainstream conservative. So the next question I asked was this. How will you vote in the next round between Le Pen and Macron? EVELYNE BIROT: I don't vote. I - we don't vote. It's not possible for me to vote Macron. LANGFITT: Why? BIROT: (Speaking French). LANGFITT: What she's saying here is, \"he's a fake. He's a fake. He's like a laundry product.\" CORNISH: A fake - how unusual is that critique? LANGFITT: You hear it a fair bit, you know, I think maybe because of his youth, because he's taken policies from the right and the left. Some people here are not really sure what he stands for. And I've also heard a number of people refer to him on the streets here as an empty shell. CORNISH: Now, what has to happen in the next 13 days to seal this election? LANGFITT: Well, he needs to reach beyond his base - this is what analysts say - for people who - to people who just don't disagree with him and obviously liked other candidates. And that's, you know - let's face it. That's 75 percent of the electorate or so - for instance, people who disagree with him on economics. He's a former investment banker, and he's obviously sort of a neoliberal. They - people feel like he needs to appeal to Socialists who are very skeptical of high finance and are also skeptical of globalization because of all the damage it's done particularly up in northern France where a lot of industrial jobs have gone away and gone overseas. CORNISH: Now, when you look at the demographic polling data on, like, which parts of French society voted the way they did, I mean how does this fit into what you're talking about? LANGFITT: Well, it's been very interesting to see how things played out yesterday. There's a company called Ipsos MORI. They did a poll of around 5,000 - close to 5,000 people. And they found that young people actually did not go very heavily to Macron even though he's 39 years old. He's a very handsome guy. They actually went for populists to the extreme right, Marine Le Pen, like you were saying, and a guy on the far left, Jean-Luc Melenchon. CORNISH: You know, Frank, we associate populism here at least right now with older voters, many of whom supported Donald Trump in the last election. Why did young voters go for populists in France? LANGFITT: Frustration. Young people here are frustrated with chronic high unemployment. They feel the mainstream parties haven't delivered for them. They're disillusioned. They're pretty desperate, and they're really looking for change. CORNISH: That's NPR's Frank Langfitt speaking to us from Paris. Frank, thanks so much. LANGFITT: Happy to do it, Audie.

Marine Le Pen later expelled her father from the National Front party.\n                \n                    \n                    Pascal Le Segretain/Getty Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption Jean-Marie Le Pen and daughter Marine Le Pen lay down flowers as part of a demonstration in Paris in 2012. Marine Le Pen later expelled her father from the National Front party. Even if far-right leader Marine Le Pen doesn't make it through the first round of French presidential elections Sunday, there's no doubt she's become a major figure in the French political landscape. In just six years at the helm of the nationalist National Front party, she has changed it from a fringe party into a national political force to be reckoned with. On a November night in 1976 when Marion Anne Perrine Le Pen was just 8 years old, a bomb ripped through her family's apartment building in Paris. The target was Le Pen's father, Jean-Marie Le Pen, a former paratrooper in the Algerian war, who founded the controversial far-right party. To this day, the perpetrators have never been caught. No one was killed, but Le Pen and her two older sisters awoke amidst shards of glass and rubble, and with an entire wall of the building blown out. \"She traces her worldview actually, about how violent the world is, back to this event that was so traumatizing,\" says Cecile Alduy, who has written a book about Le Pen. In her autobiography, Against the Flow, Le Pen writes: \"That night I went to sleep like all little girls my age. But when I woke, I was no longer a little girl like the others.\" Forty-one years later, supporters hang on Marine Le Pen's every word at a rally in Paris. It seems like not a single man in the crowd has a sliver of a doubt that she is the best candidate \u2014 male or female \u2014 to lead the party. It's a striking difference with the campaign of Hillary Clinton in the U.S., where gender was so often evoked. To understand how a woman was able to command complete control of France's most macho extremist political party, you have to go back to Le Pen's childhood, says Olivier Beaumont, who wrote a book about the Le Pen family, called In The Hell Of Montretout. He says the brutal nature of her upbringing made her very tough. After the explosion, her family moved into a stone and brick mansion in a gated community just outside Paris. The residence, called Montretout, was left to her father in the will of a rich right-winger who had no heir. \"When she arrives she is traumatized and the house smells of death because he has just died,\" Beaumont says. \"And all day long \u2014 morning, noon and night \u2014 far-right characters from the party come every day. Her father had his party offices on the first floor. The family lived above. He mixes family life and politics. It's a house of political violence and she's going to grow up bathing in this environment.\" Beaumont says Marine's childhood is one of rupture, departures and doors slamming. Her parents led a bohemian lifestyle, entertaining at all hours and sometimes going away sailing for several weeks and leaving the girls with a nanny. When she was 15, Le Pen's mother left. Alduy says it happened extremely suddenly. \"She came back from school and all her mother's clothes were gone,\" she says. \"She had gone away with another man. And Marine Le Pen was really desperate. She stopped eating.\" Le Pen wouldn't see her mother again for 15 years. Her parents subsequently went through a bitter and very public divorce. Another trauma, says Alduy, was growing up with the Le Pen name. \"Her last name was always a burden,\" Alduy says. \"She has described how being the daughter of Jean-Marie Le Pen as the National Front was emerging as a new controversial force on one hand lead her to idealize her father, who was greatly criticized. But she also suffered.\" Le Pen has said she was ostracized by her classmates, and other families did not invite her home. Alduy says it caused Le Pen to develop a sort of clan mentality and close ranks around the family and the party. Le Pen became a trial lawyer and struck out on her own for six years. During this time, she defended not only members of the far right, but represented immigrants pro bono when she thought they were unjustly treated. But she could never really escape her father's orbit. She married a prominent party member in 1995 and had three children in 1998 and 1999, including a set of twins. She raised them as a single mother after her divorce in 2000. She is currently with longtime companion, Louis Aliot, also a prominent member of the party. They are not married.

The unapparent heir On the campaign trail, Le Pen doesn't speak a lot about being a woman. But when she does, both men and women identify with her. When asked who she was and what she stood for in a recent debate, Le Pen said, \"I'm a French woman, a mother and a candidate for the presidency. For me this election is about a choice of civilizations. Our country is overrun by insecurity, economic and social disorder and Islamist terrorism. Our values and identity are under threat.\" Bertrand Dutheil De La Rochere is one of Le Pen's advisors. He says she has never tried to use her gender for political gain. \"She's a mother, she had three kids within 10 months, but she's a political man,\" he laughs. \"She does not play up the fact of being a woman to say things like, 'I want equality.' \" Dutheil De La Rochere says no one questions Le Pen's authority. He meets with her every Sunday afternoon and is in charge of issues around secularism, an important principal for Le Pen. He describes her as very serious and very prepared. But he says she also has a fun side. \"She loves cats!\" he laughs. \"And she has plenty of them. And she loves to go out and sing karaoke.\" Especially famous French singers like Dalida and her classic \"Paroles, Paroles\" with Alain Delon, he says. Dutheil De La Rochere says it's not easy for Le Pen to raise her children \u2014 who are all teenagers now \u2014 with her busy schedule. Marine was the youngest daughter of Jean Marie and Pierrette Le Pen. She is said to be the most like her father. Her mother once told a magazine that father and daughter share the same strengths, notably a reading of political situations and how to exploit them. Le Pen is taking advantage of the traditional parties' collapse in this election. But it was older sister, Marie-Caroline, who was supposed to be Jean-Marie's successor. She even ran in a local election but Beaumont says Marie-Caroline couldn't stand her father's racist remarks about blacks and Arabs, and the two split. He says they haven't spoken in 20 years. Marine was the one who took the torch left by her sister, Beaumont says. Marine Le Pen became directly involved in the party in the early 2000s and took over the leadership from her father in 2011. Her rise marked the beginning of the National Front's journey toward the mainstream of French politics. She tried to \"de-demonize\" the party and soften its image, but her father seemed to go against all her efforts, Alduy says. \"It's really hard to become president if public opinion considers you an extremist radical that might break the country,\" she says. While Marine Le Pen tried to reach out to the economically fragile and draw in more young people and women, Olivier Beaumont says her father's xenophobic and anti-Semitic outbursts continued to dog her. So she decided to do damage control and cut him loose. \"She can't stand his provocations about Nazi gas chambers and [World War II Vichy France leader] Marshal Petain, and she thinks he's trying to sink her,\" says Beaumont. The biographer says the straw that broke the camel's back was when her father's two Dobermans killed her favorite cat. \"The symbolic political rupture with her father also became physical,\" he says. Le Pen moved out of the mansion in 2014, and soon after, threw her father out of the party. The two don't speak anymore. Some speculate it was all just show to convince people the party has truly changed. But Beaumont believes the rupture is real. \"There's a big difference between Jean-Marie and Marine Le Pen,\" he says. \"The father only wanted to provoke. The daughter aspires to real power. \"",

The French go to the polls Sunday to cast ballots in the first round of a political race like no other in France's recent history: Entrenched politicians have been swept aside, with fringe candidates and untested newcomers filling the void. After Sunday, the field of 11 presidential candidates will be narrowed down to two contenders, who will face each other in a runoff on May 7. The top four candidates offer starkly opposing visions for the country. Yet they are so close in the polls that the race is impossible to predict. Polls in France are due to close at 1 p.m., ET (7 p.m., Paris time), while some larger cities' polls will close an hour later. Preliminary results could be known about 3 p.m., ET. Here are the front-runners candidates and their platforms: Emmanuel Macron is the presidential candidate of En Marche (\"On The Move\"), the party he founded.\n                \n                    \n                    Sylvain Lefevre/Getty Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption Emmanuel Macron is the presidential candidate of En Marche (\"On The Move\"), the party he founded. Emmanuel Macron currently leads the polls, with an estimated 23 percent of the vote. The 39-year-old former investment banker founded his political movement \u2014 En Marche, or On The Move \u2014 last August after stepping down as economy minister to Socialist President Francois Hollande. Macron has never been elected to public office. He says he is neither left nor right, and says the traditional parties don't have the answers for 21st century problems. The self-proclaimed progressive says he wants to make France innovative and to encourage risk taking. As president, Macron says he would make France more business-friendly and train workers for new jobs, rather than trying to save old jobs in dying industries. Corinne Mellul, a professor of political science at the Catholic Institute of Paris, says Macron provides voters hope for change and an escape from the left-right divide. \"Whether it amounts to something real remains to be seen,\" she says. \"But part of his appeal is that no one even knew who he was three years ago.\" Macron's critics say he stands for nothing and has an empty program. There also been a disinformation campaign swirling about him, and his campaign says he has been targeted by Russian hackers. The candidate is pro-European Union and takes a hard line on Putin. Some of the conspiracy theories charge that Macron is an agent of U.S. banks. Others say he has a secret private life or may be gay. Macron married his high school French teacher, who is 24 years his senior. Brigitte, his wife, appears regularly with him in public, and is said to be closely involved with his campaign. Marine Le Pen is the presidential candidate of the far-right National Front.\n                \n                    \n                    Lionel Bonaventure/AFP/Getty Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption Marine Le Pen is the presidential candidate of the far-right National Front. Marine Le Pen, leader of the far right, trails by just one point behind Macron in polls. The National Front party has never been so strong. In 2011, Le Pen took over leadership of the party founded in 1972 by her father, Jean-Marie Le Pen. She has worked to bring the National Front more into the mainstream and break with the party's xenophobic, anti-Semitic past. She has succeeded in \"de-demonizing\" the party to a great extent. Today, National Front supporters include many more women and young people. Her rallies are now full of middle-class, working professionals, not just angry blue-collar workers. And while Jean-Marie Le Pen just wanted to shake up the system, Marine Le Pen wants true power. If elected, Le Pen says France will vote in a referendum to leave the European Union, which she calls a tyrannical, undemocratic institution. France is one of the key founders of the EU, and if it pulls out, analysts say the EU could not survive. Another priority for Le Pen is reinstating France's borders and severely curbing immigration. Le Pen believes the wind of history is behind her. She says globalization is gutting industry and agriculture in countries across Europe, and people yearn for a return to the strong nation-state. Le Pen promotes \"economic patriotism,\" which she says the EU prohibits. In other words, she wants to promote, buy, consume and eat French. Francois Fillon is the presidential candidate of the center-right Republicans party.\n                \n                    \n                    Sylvain Lefevre/Getty Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption Francois Fillon is the presidential candidate of the center-right Republicans party. Francois Fillon is the only candidate from the mainstream political establishment and the only one with real experience in governing. Fillon served as prime minister to President Nicolas Sarkozy. Though Sarkozy allegedly treated him as an underling, Fillon got his revenge by soundly defeating his former boss (who was hoping to make a political comeback) in the conservative primary last November. Fillon is a polished and seasoned politician and a wholesome family man who was considered a shoo-in for the French presidency \u2014 until January, when allegations surfaced that he may have employed his wife in a fake job as his parliamentary aide. Fillon is now under official investigation. He has also admitted to accepting expensive suits and watches from \"a friend.\" (France has discovered that Fillon is a man of luxury tastes.) Despite the cloud hanging over him, Fillon has plugged on, proclaiming his innocence. Hiring family members is not illegal in France, as long as they do real work. And he did give back those suits. Even so, the scandal has tarnished him. Fillon once touted himself as the \"irreproachable\" candidate for the party founded by Gen. Charles de Gaulle. Not anymore. \"I'm not asking you to love me, I'm asking you to support me,\" Fillon said at a recent rally. \"It's not about choosing a friend but about choosing a leader for the destiny of France.\" If elected, the fiscal conservative says he'll get the country's finances back in order by cutting public sector jobs and reducing the deficit. That won't be easy with his own credibility in question. Still, Fillon cannot be counted out. He's managed to maintain 19 percent support (just a couple points behind Macron and Le Pen) despite the relentless attacks against him. His supporters can also be counted on to go out and vote. Political analyst Pascal Perrineau says many in Fillon's historically solid base will have no problem supporting him. \"Many people will say, 'OK, so he got some suits and watches, what's so grave about that?'\" Perrineau says. \"It's like the reasoning in Machiavelli's The Prince. Do we ask a prince to be moral or efficient? And Machiavelli says efficient.\" Jean-Luc Melenchon is the presidential candidate for the far-left coalition La France Insoumise (\"Untamed France\").\n                \n                    \n                    Lionel Bonaventure/AFP/Getty Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption Jean-Luc Melenchon is the presidential candidate for the far-left coalition La France Insoumise (\"Untamed France\"). Jean-Luc Melenchon has surged in the polls in recent weeks and is now just half a point behind Fillon. Known by some as \"French Bernie Sanders,\" Melenchon is a charismatic speaker and began to soar after his humorous, brilliant performances in both televised debates. (Nevermind that he's a former Trotskyist.) Many of Melenchon's ideas are similar to Le Pen's. Both oppose globalization and want generous social benefits and protection for workers. Neither likes the European Union. \"That there are a lot of similarities should not be a surprise,\" says Mellul, the political science professor. \"The far left and the far right appeal to the same electorate. The disgruntled, left-out, working class and the disenfranchised victims of globalization.\" Like Sanders in the U.S., Mellul says, Melenchon attracts young voters who think he can really change things. \"Don't underestimate the constant popularity of Trotskyism and communist ideas,\" she says. \"And by communist, I'm not talking about the Soviet experiment, but Karl Marx. The appeal of this has never died in France.\" Analyst Perrineau says whoever wins Sunday is unlikely to be able to unite a very divided country. \"We see there are two Frances,\" he says. \"One is doing well. It is cosmopolitan, it has many colors and speaks several languages. But go out from the cities, you can find another France. It's immobile, unemployed and worried about its identity. A president must represent both sides of France and each of these candidates only speaks to one.\"",

Prelec said she brought Sergei with her from Medfield, Mass., \"to experience love of country.\" My sons remember the bitter cold. And they remember the warmth. They felt it on the toasty subway car jammed to the doorsills with people at 5 a.m., smiling a knowing smile at strangers riding with us from Columbia Heights to the National Mall and Barack Obama's second presidential inauguration. They also remember the warmth of the massive crowd that day, shoulder-to-shoulder in the expanse between the U.S. Capitol and the Washington Monument, where you were likely to step on a toe or jolt an elbow just by shifting your weight from one foot to the other. But everyone understood and smiled back at them and forgave. The shared joy was palpable. As Donald Trump prepared to officially become the nation's 45th president on Friday, I returned to the Mall in search of that feeling. In 2013, I took my oldest and youngest sons, Keith Jr. and Noah, to see Obama's inauguration. I wanted them to know what it felt like to see a black man assume the highest office in the land. I wanted them to feel the pride they'd find in the president who looked something like them; in the presidency that was newly achievable; in the country that had made a monumental leap in a cosmic blink of an eye. Their middle brother, Matthew, had been there four years earlier, in 2009, in even colder temperatures, shivering along with other students in a young leaders program, warmed by the history unfolding before him. I wanted to feel all that with them. So, after a scorched-earth presidential campaign and too many years of corrosive social and racial discord that all but obliterated the warmth and good will of two inaugurations, I was back. How would it feel on the subway; in the security lines; on the Mall? Some of the answers, I already knew. I didn't expect to get the warm fuzzies when people booed the exiting First Couple or aimed that special animus at the vanquished Hillary Clinton. This was not my crowd. I didn't expect to groove to the Mormon Tabernacle Choir or the Chorale from Missouri. This was not my music. Even when the masses chanted things my sons chanted in 2013 (U-S-A! U-S-A!) and sang the National Anthem that I sang with such gusto then, I felt outside of it. This was not my party. I set out to meet parents who, like me, had brought their children to their first inauguration so that they, like my sons, could feel that feeling. Would it be the same for them (minus the black president part, I mean) as it was for me? Thomas Eickes of Norfolk, Va., wanted his 8-year-old son Tommy to witness the \"peaceful change of power\" at Trump's inauguration.\n                \n                    \n                    Keith Woods\n                    \n                \nhide caption Thomas Eickes of Norfolk, Va., wanted his 8-year-old son Tommy to witness the \"peaceful change of power\" at Trump's inauguration. Thomas Eickes, a Navy man from Norfolk, Va., had a look I recognized. He was standing near one of the massive outdoor television screens with Thomas Jr., 8, huddled close against the chill while dignitaries took their seats far in the distance. His eyes told me he was there with purpose. With pride. \"It's important for him to see a peaceful exchange of power,\" he said of Tommy. \"I wanted him to see that people are free to come here and voice their opinions. My hope is that one day, when he's old enough to vote, that this will encourage him to get involved and make a difference.\" Yes. I wanted that for my sons. He went on: \"Everybody's been so juiced. On the train; here. No one's hostile. It's been great so far.\" There were jeers around us when the cameras so much as glanced by Hillary Clinton, but there were more gracious moments, like the applause that greeted the announcement of Barack and Michelle Obama as they descended the Capitol steps. \"People will always have different opinions, but we're all Americans,\" Thomas Sr. went on, looking down at Tommy. \"I want him to appreciate it; to know that it's important.\" I was with him. In lock step. And then ... \"I'm optimistic that people will have more opportunity for jobs,\" he said. \"My hope is that [Trump] will turn things around. This country is in a moral downward spiral. Our family values; what made this country what it is ... I hope this is an opportunity for people to get their values back.\" My wish for our children as they stood in the cold four and eight years ago was that they'd see an America that was finally living values we've never fully realized: dignity and opportunity for all; the beginning of bigotry's end and the true embrace of our diversity; action behind the notion that we are each our brother's keeper. I'd asked a man earlier, Chuck Taylor of Merritt Island, Fl., when it was that America was last great, inasmuch as he'd invoked Trump's campaign slogan. It was definitely before the \"super socialism\" of the Obama years, he told me. It was around the 1960s, when jobs were good, poverty levels were low, and \"the biggest percentage of the human race was doing well.\" That was not my 1960s. Taylor's son Mike was there, and he'd brought his 19-year-old nephew, Taylor Wharton, to feel the optimism and national pride; to be a part of something historic. \"It feels like a groundswell,\" Wharton said as we waited in the interminable security line to get onto the National Mall. \"It's like the 4th of July in January. I hope we're bridging the divide. Everybody puts a label on us. We have to get to the place where, just because some police do bad things, all police aren't bad, or just because some college students protest and get arrested, it doesn't mean that all college students are bad.\" NPR's Keith Woods (right), with sons Keith Jr. (left) and Noah, attend the 2013 inauguration of President Barack Obama.\n                \n                    \n                    Keith Woods\n                    \n                \nhide caption NPR's Keith Woods (right), with sons Keith Jr. (left) and Noah, attend the 2013 inauguration of President Barack Obama.

Noah, 16, is a high school sophomore. What did they feel? I asked. What did they remember? Keith Jr.: \"There was a sense of love and compassion for one another in the air. So many different types of people from all different backgrounds all in one place to support one man and his family. In stark contrast to today.\" Matthew Urban, the writer's stepson, attended the Presidential Inaugural Conference in 2009 and saw President Barack Obama sworn in for the first time.\n                \n                    \n                    Matthew Urban\n                    \n                \nhide caption Matthew Urban, the writer's stepson, attended the Presidential Inaugural Conference in 2009 and saw President Barack Obama sworn in for the first time. Matt: \"I have been told from a very young age that you can be whatever you want in life, but there were 43 white presidents telling me something a little different. Attending that first Obama inauguration, I got to see the beauty of America, but also the hate, because \u2013 especially in the South \u2013 people were angry about a black man achieving the highest office in our country. So it showed me that glass ceilings can be broken, but not without truly pissing some people off along the way.\" Noah: \"There was a level of surrealism when we all sat there in the freezing cold, staring at the Jumbotron in the distance. There also seemed like a sense of hope that things would change, and that the world would start to heal after what had divided us.\" I sent Noah a follow-up text: \"And now?\" \"That hope isn't really there,\" he wrote back. \"I'm scared the progress we've made in 8 years will be reversed in 4.\" Hope. Everyone uses the word. It defines the experience of standing there among like-minded people, watching the relentless gears of democracy turn; your candidate with hand raised; this man in whom you've invested some dream, some ambition. Some hope. These hopes I heard sounded like mine. None more than Leila Prelec of Medfield, Mass. She is an immigrant from Greece. She was there with 13-year-old Sergei Tourian, her adopted son from Russia. Trump had just delivered his first speech as president, a blistering account of the state of the union that must have left hope cowering in a rhetorical corner. But Prelec felt the hope so deeply that, no more than five words in, she was crying. \"Trump has made me feel like an American,\" she told me as she dabbed her eyes. \"The way he speaks is very unpolished. It's of the earth. It sounds like me. He's not an intellectual like Obama. ... He's never pretended to be anyone other than who he is.\" Prelec said she had studied at Harvard and Oxford, that she was turned off by Obama's \"post-Colonial feminism,\" his globalism, his liberal values that seemed so anti-Christian. Clinton \"was looking down on me,\" she said. With Trump, she said, we get to say Merry Christmas again instead of the generic Happy Holidays. We can be who we are. She had taken Sergei to get an autograph when candidate Trump visited Worcester, Mass. When she talked about the feeling of love in that crowd, she started crying again. \"He's a man of the people,\" she said. \"I was struck by how gentle he was.\" Reality check. I've seen the images and scenes from Trump rallies, and I imagine Leila and I wouldn't have had to go far in Friday's crowd to find the profane, vulgar, racist, xenophobic and homophobic folks I'd seen on YouTube. She had obviously thought a lot about that; about how those values conflicted with hers; how they threatened her son. I want to know: Where is common ground? How can I articulate the common ground. Leila Prelec, Medford, Mass. \"It's very interesting,\" she said. \"When I was in that crowd, I felt my own anger. [Trump] releases it. He lets us feel our feelings, which were being repressed. The bad stuff has to come out. We can't blame Trump for that. He gave me permission to be myself. That's why he's a role model. He's a flawed individual. I'm a flawed individual.\" Sergei, she said, will \"survive the bad [in politics] by having me as a mother. I feel that love reigns in my heart. I can't take that for granted, I know. Sometimes I'm tempted to get puffed up when I'm part of a mass of people like this and I feel like shouting something at the other side. But that doesn't define me. \"I want to know: Where is common ground? How can I articulate the common ground.\" I don't know. I don't know. We share so much in common, me and the people on the Mall, right down to that feeling of hope, the dreams we have for ourselves and our children, so potent and profound and emotionally imminent that even before you say the words you're crying. These were not partisans mouthing the un-interrogated rhetoric of a political campaign. They were just people living their lives and raising their kids. But they had also decided for my children a future that frightens me and dulls the hope of my 16-year-old son. They spoke to me in codes that I can easily translate. Of \"political correctness,\" that euphemism for the burden of thought that comes with empathy, consideration and civility. They talked in transparent code about being extricated \u2013 finally! \u2013 from the tyranny of politicians who would love and protect the rights of gay, lesbian, bisexual or transgender Americans; who would keep the country's arms open to Muslims and Mexicans even as they know the threat of immigration abuses or terrorism; who would make a bold play to give health care to the least of us; who would defend a woman's birthright to self-determination. These fellow parents, fellow Americans, used words that I use \u2013 family, values, hope. They described perfectly the feeling I had when I stood there that day, four years ago, and held my sons close against the cold. But it was not my crowd. Theirs was not my kind of pride. Not my definition of values. Their hopes would undo my dreams.",

The two are seen here at the Elysee in 2014. Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Jalkh has stepped down as the leader of France's far-right National Front party, after controversy over his remarks about Nazi Germany's use of Zyklon B gas to kill Jews during World War II. Jalkh had taken over from presidential candidate Marine Le Pen just three days ago. With Le Pen in a tight race against centrist Emmanuel Macron ahead of the May 7 election, accusations of Holocaust denial in her party's leadership have stirred memories of its founder, her father Jean-Marie Le Pen, whose xenophobic and anti-Semitic outbursts led her to oust him from the party in 2015. Jalkh \"feels that there isn't the necessary serenity for him to to perform this interim role,\" National Front vice president Louis Aliot told TV station BFM on Friday. Aliot, who is also Le Pen's longtime partner, said Jalkh plans to defend himself from allegations that he denied the reality of the Holocaust \u2014 an act that's illegal in France. Jalkh's resignation came days after a 2000 interview was resurfaced by journalist Laurent de Boissieu, who said on Twitter that he found it in an academic paper that was later republished. In that interview, Jalkh was quoted discussing skepticism over the feasibility of using Zyklon B gas to carry out mass exterminations; he also cited Holocaust denier Robert Faurisson.

The National Front will now be led by interim President Steeve Briois, a mayor of the northern city of Henin-Beaumont.",

Updated at 11:50 p.m. ET Emmanuel Macron, a centrist politician who's never held elective office, and Marine Le Pen, the far-right firebrand who wants to take France out of the European Union, are expected to advance to next month's runoff for the presidency of the country, according to official results. French presidential election candidate for the En Marche ! movement Emmanuel Macron (L) stands next to his wife, Brigitte Trogneux as he casts his ballot at a polling station in Le Touquet, northern France, on April 23, 2017, during the first round of the Presidential election.\n                \n                    \n                    Philippe Wojazer/AFP/Getty Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption French presidential election candidate for the En Marche ! movement Emmanuel Macron (L) stands next to his wife, Brigitte Trogneux as he casts his ballot at a polling station in Le Touquet, northern France, on April 23, 2017, during the first round of the Presidential election. When the final numbers trickled in, Macron had nearly 24 percent of the vote, followed by Le Pen at around 22 percent. Francois Fillon, the only establishment candidate among the front-runners, appeared tied for third place with left-wing politician Jean-Luc Melenchon with around 20 percent of the vote each. If the numbers hold up as expected, it will set up a battle in May between two politicians with not only completely different visions for France but \u2014 more significantly \u2014 utterly different views of one of the biggest issues facing many voters in the West today: globalization. Macron is a liberal, former investment banker and an avowed internationalist who worked as economy minister in France's Socialist government. Le Pen has run a tough, anti-immigrant campaign and has vowed to take France out of the European Union. If she were successful, it would probably sink an institution that has helped bind Europe together for decades. Last night, rival politicians, including Fillon, the nominee of the conservative Republican Party, began to rally around Macron to prevent Le Pen from taking the presidency. \"There is no other choice but to vote against the far right, I will vote for Emmanuel Macron,\" Fillon told supporters.

Elsewhere in Europe, liberal globalists cheered Macron's strong showing. A spokesman for Germany's Angela Merkel said she wished him \"all the best,\" and Peter Altmaier, Merkel's chief of staff tweeted: \"The result for @EmmanuelMacron shows: France AND Europe can win together! The middle is stronger than the populists believe!\" European Commission President Jean-Claus Juncker congratulated him as well. In his victory speech, Macron, 39, sounded at times as if he'd already won the election. \"I want to be the president of all the people of France,\" he said. \"The challenge is to open a new page in our political life and to take action so that everyone is able to find his or her place in France and in Europe.\" By contrast, Le Pen called her second-place finish a \"historic result\" and urged \"all patriots\" to back her party in next month's runoff. \"Now, we have an enormous responsibility to defend the French culture,\" she told supporters. \"You will get a France that protects the people, we will not have the free circulation of terrorists.\" For France, today's results mark a political earthquake. French voters appear to have sent a strong rebuke to the country's traditional political parties. For the first time since the end of World War II, an establishment right or left-wing party will not control the presidency. After many years of high unemployment and a steady drumbeat of political scandals, voters turned their backs on the establishment and instead backed a political newcomer in Macron and a far-right candidate in Le Pen. Olivier Duhamel, a political scientist at Sciences Po Paris, one of France's top universities, said the fact that someone with so little experience came out on top today was stunning. \"A man nobody knew, a very young man, this is incredibly American, this is absolutely not French,\" he said. \"That proves that France in a way, this evening, is less of a monarchy and more a democracy.\" For Americans, Duhamel said it would have been the equivalent of Ross Perot beating then-incumbent U.S. President George H.W. Bush and Democratic nominee Bill Clinton in the 1992 election. Political analysts say Macron's apparent win today showed that many French people still believe in a more liberal, open, global society even as populists have won big victories in the last year with the United Kingdom's vote to leave the European Union and Donald Trump's election in the United States. \"We should not underestimate the capacity of resistance of other groups within societies, which are supporting more moderate parties,\" said Alain Dieckhoff, head of the Center for International Research at Sciences Po. The runoff election will take place May 7, and the country will hold parliamentary elections about a month after that. Polls suggest and many analysts predict that Macron enjoys a steep advantage going into a head-to-head race with Le Pen. \"I think that the success \u2014 even if it's just the first round now \u2014 of Macron is also a good indication there are still very powerful forces in French society ... [that] don't really want to go in the direction of populist parties and really xenophobic positions,\" says Dieckhoff.",

The school, which almost closed eight years ago, has experienced growth over the past few years, largely due to an influx of Catholic families who were drawn to Hyattsville by a desire to live among others who share their values. At a time of declining church attendance across America and growing disenchantment with traditional religion, a Catholic parish in Hyattsville, Md., thrives by embracing the very orthodoxy other congregations have abandoned. St. Jerome Catholic Church and its affiliated school, St. Jerome Academy, have both experienced dramatic growth over the past few years, largely due to an influx of families drawn to the parish's reputation as a haven for conservative Catholics seeking to live among others who share their values. \"The parish life was very important to us,\" says Daniel Gibbons, 40, who teaches at Catholic University in nearby Washington, D.C., and moved to Hyattsville with his young family four years ago. \"I know from my own childhood that it can be very hard to raise children as a Catholic if you don't have a community of other Catholics who are trying to make the faith real in their everyday lives and raise the children in ways that are harmonious with their faith.\" Several of the new St. Jerome families previously had been home schooling their children, after disappointing experiences in both public and parochial schools. \"Faith-based education was very important to us,\" says Julia Dickson, 37, who moved to Hyattsville with her husband two years ago from a Baltimore suburb. \"There was no [private] school that I felt was any different from a public school with a religion class tacked on,\" she says. \"I wanted something with the Lord as the center of the entire day.\" St. Jerome Academy, which almost had to close its doors eight years ago because of financial difficulties and low enrollment, experienced a dramatic turnaround after switching to a \"classical\" curriculum with a heavy emphasis on the history of Western civilization, taught always with reference to the Bible and the development of Christian faith. The town of Hyattsville itself, with a population of barely 17,000, is also an attraction to these young Catholic families. Though located just beyond the D.C. limits, the historic community was established before the automobile age and is highly walkable. A key gathering spot is the Vigilante Coffee Roastery & Cafe, situated around the corner from the church and the school. Young mothers, many with babies in tow, congregate there each morning. The cafe manager is a former teacher from Los Angeles who also serves as the youth minister at St. Jerome. Most of the families live within a 2-mile radius. \"Our kids are continually at each other's homes,\" says Michelle Trudeau, 48, a mother of six who home-schooled her four oldest children before enrolling them at the parish school, where she is now the assistant principal. \"As parents, we know we can trust what's going on in that other house,\" she says. \"We know that if something goes on with our kids, other parents are looking out for them. We all become parents of each other's children.\" The tightness of the Hyattsville Catholic community developed deliberately, not accidentally. The key figure in its growth was Chris Currie, a former nonprofit executive who moved to Hyattsville 20 years ago and now serves as director of institutional advancement at the parish school. \"It started with me inviting people I knew to come here,\" he says. \"My sister's family was the first to move here, followed by a couple of friends. Other families came here to become part of the foundation, and then by word of mouth people heard about it and came here because of the heightened community life.\" About a dozen Catholic women in Hyattsville gather each week to pray the rosary together.\n                \n                    \n                    Tom Gjelten/NPR\n                    \n                \nhide caption About a dozen Catholic women in Hyattsville gather each week to pray the rosary together. As an \"intentional\" community centered on a parish and its school, Hyattsville came to the attention of Rod Dreher, a writer specializing in Christian culture. In his best-selling and widely discussed new book, The Benedict Option: A Strategy for Christians in a Post-Christian Nation, Dreher urges conservative Christians in America to withdraw from culture wars and partisan politics and focus instead on deepening their own faith through a semi-monastic life. Dreher's model is St. Benedict, the sixth century monk recognized as the founder of Western monasticism. \"We have to develop creative, communal solutions to help us hold on to our faith and our values in a world growing ever more hostile to them,\" Dreher writes. He describes the Hyattsville Catholic community in his book as \"a strong model of being in the world but not of it.\" In an interview with NPR, Dreher lamented the replacement of \"traditional\" Christianity with \"pseudo-Christianity,\" which he described as \"all about feeling good and happy about yourself.\" \"For a lot of people in modernity,\" Dreher said, \"religion has become sort of a psychological help. It has become a way of rationalizing what we want to do anyway and putting a little Jesus sauce on top to make it go down easily.\" There is little \"pseudo\" about the Catholicism lived in Hyattsville. Bible study groups meet regularly, and a dozen or more women in the community gather weekly to say the rosary together, a custom that has become rare among Catholics more generally. The women pray to the sound of crying babies and squealing toddlers. \"We're very open to life,\" explains 32-year-old Jane Murphy, who has three children under the age of 5. \"In the Catholic Church, we don't believe in artificial contraception, and that results in a lot of babies!\" The community's adherence to official church doctrine also means the Hyattsville Catholics are increasingly in a cultural minority. They differ with many in the LGBT world, for example, over such issues as same-sex marriage, which the Vatican opposes. \"I think that what the church teaches about marriage is the best for family life,\" says Gibbons, the Catholic University professor. Whether the community reflects Dreher's \"Benedict Option\" is a matter of some dispute, however, in part because many of the Hyattsville Catholics are deeply engaged in the broader society and say they do not feel marginalized, angry or alienated. Many have advanced degrees and work professionally. Unlike other conservative Christians, they are not easy to categorize politically, having split their votes about evenly between Donald Trump and other candidates in the 2016 election. Jane Murphy (shown here with two of her three children), moved to Hyattsville with her husband to be part of the local Catholic community and send their kids to St. Jerome Academy.\n                \n                    \n                    Tom Gjelten /NPR\n                    \n                \nhide caption Currie, the community founder, looks for comparison to the experience of the early Christians under Roman rule, when they thrived despite vicious persecution. \"They lived joyful lives, and they attracted converts by the example of their lives,\" he says. \"I think that's what we're trying to do, live the way they did. Not live defensively, in sort of a paranoid xenophobic reaction to the rest of society, but to realize that we're all human beings created in the image of God, and to live that life ourselves and share it with our neighbors.\" Critics say the risk in people choosing deliberately to live in a like-minded community is that it may not equip them well to deal with the challenges and opportunities of a pluralistic society, but the Hyattsville Catholics question that premise. \"For me personally,\" says Murphy, \"living in this community has strengthened my faith so that I can go out to the wider community, the secular community, and talk with confidence about my faith.

Having lived outside my native Britain for nearly 16 years, I recently lost my right to vote there. But I was still entitled to do so last June in the U.K.'s referendum on European Union membership. When I awoke on June 24 to hear that my country had voted in favor of a Brexit, I felt bereft. So, like many other British citizens living in Germany, I decided to apply for German citizenship. I was determined to remain a member of the EU, even if the narrow majority of British voters were not. Since 2001, I have been an EU migrant \u2014 the very type of person, or as it turned out, persona non grata, against whom much of the Leave campaign was pitted. While the xenophobic Brexit rhetoric was directed primarily at those, particularly from Eastern Europe, living and working in the U.K., I have never experienced such sentiment in Germany, where I have always felt welcome. Britain has been a member of the EU longer than I have, so I've always been aware of something greater than just Britain, and I've always considered myself both European and British. I have also benefited from EU membership my entire life \u2014 from studying free at the University of Salzburg in Austria to seizing the cultural, language-learning and career opportunities afforded by freedom of movement: the right to travel, work and live in 28 European countries. Germany is the member state I came to in 2001 \u2014 originally just for a year, but it is where I have lived happily ever since. So, in my own bid to \"remain,\" I embarked on the bureaucratic path to obtaining a German passport. I met all the requirements for citizenship: I have been living in Germany for more than eight years, I pay my taxes and social welfare contributions and I speak the language fluently. Nicholson, on a 2015 visit to the House of World Cultures museum in Berlin, has called the city home since 2001.\n                \n                    \n                    Courtesy of Esme Nicholson\n                    \n                \nhide caption As I pulled together the required paperwork, I came across my A Level certificates, the British equivalent of a high school diploma. These certificates were my passport to attaining a bachelor's, master's and Ph.D. in German studies, as well as the language skills needed to seek work in Germany. Funny enough, it was Theresa May who handed me these at my school graduation ceremony, back when she was just our local member of Parliament in Berkshire. May was previously in favor of remaining in the EU, but as Britain's prime minister, she's promising a \"hard Brexit.\" I also had to pass a German citizenship test, the first multiple choice exam I've ever done. As I turned in the test paper, I realized that I am probably better versed in the history, politics and constitution of Germany than of Britain. But considering I've reported on Germany for the best part of a decade, it would have been embarrassing had I not passed. The whole procedure took just three months. When news of my forthcoming citizenship ceremony arrived in the mail in January, it caught me a little off guard. Suddenly, I was going to be German. None of my family are German, so what did this mean? My parents and my brother were very happy for me and consider my decision a wise one. I wonder, though, what my late grandparents would have thought of my becoming German. My paternal grandmother, who spoke to me about the Blitz on just one occasion, never entirely understood my decision to live in Berlin, even if she accepted and respected it. But Berlin has become my home. And once I'd digested the German authorities' decision to accept me as one of their own, it dawned on me that \u2014 perhaps unwittingly \u2014 I've spent much of my life becoming German. I always attributed my fascination with German language and literature to my teachers and professors. But what really draws me to Germany, I've come to realize, is something central to the very essence of being German in this era \"after Auschwitz.\" It's the concept \u2014 or value, even \u2014 of Vergangenheitsbewaeltigung, which means coming to terms with the past, specifically the Nazi past. It permeates German society, culture and politics, in which questions are raised again and again about collective responsibility for the atrocities of the Nazi regime. I first encountered this concept as a student, in the writings of Guenter Grass and Heinrich Boell. But I was surprised to find that German friends of my own age consider it a duty to deal with a past that they themselves did not live through. These friends' parents were the generation known as \"1968ers\" \u2014 West German baby boomers politicized by the student protest movement of the late 1960s. They questioned their own parents about what they did in World War II, and then passed on the responsibility to keep questioning to the next generation. Now I see these same friends helping their own children try to comprehend the barbarity of the Holocaust and what it demands of civil society, democracy and humanity \u2014 to ensure it never happens again. And now that I am also German with full suffrage, I realize I share this civic responsibility. Such diligent efforts to face up to the past are, perhaps, needed more than ever as Germany's populist right-wing Alternative for Germany \u2014 AfD \u2014 party whips up fears about the large numbers of refugees and migrants who have arrived in the past few years. But even as right-wing populists like AfD member Bjoern Hoecke call upon Germans to stop atoning for their past, Germany's perpetual act of self-reflection is facing other challenges. Some argue that Vergangenheitsbewaeltigung is actually enabling the resurgence of the far right, which labels it as elitist political correctness. (Others suggest that Hoecke's comments are harming his party.) I hail from a country where reckoning with the past is not part of the culture. Unlike German schoolchildren, who are routinely taken to see what remains of the concentration camps, I was, regrettably, taught nothing at school of the darker sides of Britain's colonial past. Like many of my friends back in England, I have never been overtly proud of being British. The very idea of waving a Union Jack flag has always struck me as somewhat distasteful and conjures up old images of the far-right British National Party. I was raised to believe that modesty, even self-deprecation, is preferable to glaring displays of patriotism. Nicholson vacationed on the Atlantic coast of Cornwall in her native Britain in 2013.\n                \n                    \n                    Courtesy of Esme Nicholson\n                    \n                \nhide caption But perhaps this unease about national pride is another reason I found myself drawn to German culture. Many Germans, for obvious reasons, are not always proud of being German. Yes, since the country hosted the soccer World Cup in 2006, fans have lost this inhibition and wave their flags together with the rest of the world, but many Germans I know still feel uncomfortable at such a patent display of patriotism, even in the name of sport. So, on the day of my citizenship ceremony last month, I arrived at the turn-of-the-century town hall in the Berlin borough of Neukoelln feeling somewhat detached from the process. That changed as soon as the service began. I was one of 50 people from 22 different countries being granted German citizenship that day. We came from Ethiopia, Italy, Britain, Iraq, France, Turkey, Syria, Korea, the U.S. and beyond. A pianist and cellist played the national anthem for the country of origin of every single person there. On hearing \"God Save the Queen,\" my usual awkward reaction gave way to an emotion for which there is a very fitting word in German \u2014 Fremdschaemen \u2014 which means feeling shame on behalf of others. In this case, the shame I felt was on behalf of those who voted for Brexit because of \u2014 or in spite of \u2014 an ugly discourse about immigration. Yet as soon as the duo moved on to the national anthems of others, many of whom were forced to leave their countries for fear of persecution, the musical offerings moved me. It was a touching gesture of respect, a respect that is enshrined in German Basic Law, the constitution to which we all had to pledge our allegiance before receiving our certificates from the district mayor. Once we'd all been declared German citizens, we were required to stand and sing the German national anthem. It was the first time I've sung a national anthem of any country and I felt slightly uncomfortable doing so. Then again, so do most Germans I know. But one anthem that day moved me to tears, and led me to cast aside my cautious misgivings about national pride. Beethoven's \"Ode to Joy,\" the EU's anthem, reminded me of my European identity and of the EU ideal that diverse nations and cultures work together for peace and prosperity. I left the ceremony feeling a sense of hope that had diminished over the past year, on account of political developments across the globe. My quiet optimism was triggered by the mayor, who quoted the German Constitution: \"Human dignity is inviolable. ... All persons are equal before the law. ... No person shall be favored or disfavored because of sex, parentage, race, language, homeland and origin, faith or religious or political opinions. No person shall be disfavored because of disability. ... There shall be no censorship.\" These words, more than the national anthems, were music to my ears. So was the knowledge that I now have a voice and will be able to vote in Germany's election later this year. After the ceremony, the mayor cut slices of heavy rye bread and handed them out with salt, a traditional German welcome gesture. I took my slice home, and spread Marmite on it. I may well be German now, but I remain a British citizen, too, and some habits die hard. Radio journalist Esme Nicholson reports and produces for NPR's Berlin bureau.

For 10 days every winter, nearly a million people show up to visit a Paris convention center that's been transformed into a piece of the French countryside. The Salon de l'Agriculture, which runs Feb. 25 to March 5, is one of the world's largest agricultural fairs. Inside the massive, hangar-like exposition hall on the west end of Paris, dozens of breeds of milk and beef cows chew their cud and watch hordes of visitors, as baby lambs scamper about their hay-filled stalls. Farmers tout their high-quality meats and cheeses and young people learn what it's like to work on a farm. And during a heated political campaign season, this farm show is an obligatory stop for any presidential candidate.

Retired engineer Gilles Roque says Parisians young and old show up here every year because farming holds a kind of mythic place in the French psyche. \"We French, even though we mostly live in the city now, we have peasants and farmers in our ancestry,\" he says. \"Farming is part of our heritage. It's in the French soul.\" France is also the European Union's top agricultural producer, with exports of more than $60 billion a year. With a presidential election coming in May, the importance of candidates paying their respects to the guardians of this nation's cherished farmland and villages cannot be underestimated. On Tuesday, far-right candidate and front-runner Marine Le Pen made her visit. There was such a dense scrum of reporters, cameras and microphones surrounding her that all you could see was the top of her platinum-blonde head bobbing as she walked around, talking to farmers. France is Europe's top agricultural producer.

Vegetables and fruit are on display at the 10-day Paris agricultural fair. Roque filmed it all on his cell phone. He says voters today are tired of 40 years of going back and forth between right and left. Many are choosing the two outsider candidates, Le Pen and political newcomer Emmanuel Macron, who stepped down as President Francois Hollande's economy minister to launch his own movement and run as an independent. Roque says he's always voted Socialist, but this year, he's thinking of voting for Le Pen. \"She has completely changed the party from her father's day,\" he says. \"She's created a solid base that's no longer extremist. And you see that in the simple, regular people who want to vote for her now.\" Le Pen took over the far-right National Front party from her father, Jean-Marie Le Pen, in 2011. He was seen as a xenophobic and racist firebrand. His daughter has worked to soften the party's image and attract new voters. Today she is leading the presidential race, with 27 percent support in recent polls. Retired engineer Gilles Roque says Parisians young and old show up here every year because farming holds a kind of mythic place in the French psyche.\n                \n                    \n                    Eleanor Beardsley/NPR\n                    \n                \nhide caption Retired engineer Gilles Roque says Parisians young and old show up here every year because farming holds a kind of mythic place in the French psyche. And she's even more popular in the hard-working world of rural France. Le Pen favors leaving the European Union, boosting aid to French farmers and promoting French products. A recent poll in Le Monde showed her support at 35 percent among farmers. But not every farmer at the Paris agriculture show is enthusiastic about about Le Pen. Thierry Chabot, who makes the famous Comt\u00e9 cheese in the mountains near the Swiss border, is one who isn't. He's brought some of his Montbeliard cows here, wearing giant bells around their necks. Chabot says he doesn't like Le Pen's ideas about leaving the European Union. \"Today we can't live without Europe,\" he says. \"We sell our products in the EU, we have a European currency, we can't go backwards. And we see how the English regret their decision to leave.\" Chabot says most French farmers vote conservative, and their favored candidate has been Francois Fillon, on the mainstream right. But Fillon is under investigation for allegedly creating a fictitious, high-paying government job for his wife. In a last-minute surprise Wednesday that had the French news channels in a speculative frenzy, Fillon suddenly cancelled his scheduled visit to the farm show. With news that the investigation into a possible fictitious job scheme is going forward, Fillon called a press conference to denounce a \"political attack\" and vowed to continue his campaign. Even with Fillon looking less and less attractive, Chabot says he's hesitant about voting Le Pen. He says the political turmoil he's seen in the U.S. after President Trump's election gives him pause. No one seems too excited about Macron, currently running second in the polls behind Le Pen. Thierry Chabot's Montbeliard cows wear giant bells around their necks.

Three women who are discussing the election tell me Le Pen has nothing to do with Donald Trump. They say she is much smarter and savvier than him. One of the women, Martine Le Monze recently retired from a research job at a respected scientific institute. She says she's always voted for mainstream right candidates, but this year, her vote will go to Le Pen. \"We really hope she'll be elected because France is so low right now and she's the only on who can bring us up,\" says Le Monze. \"She has a program for the old, the young, the farmers \u2013 and it's the only viable plan.\" Le Monze and her friends say Macron is a neophyte with no program at all. The centrist candidate has revealed the overall themes of his campaign and is expected to present a detailed platform on March 2. What's strikingly different about attitudes here since the last presidential election just five years ago is that the typical Le Pen voter \u2014 usually blue-collar and without higher education \u2014 seems a thing of the past. And there is no shame anymore about voting for the National Front.",

            "article_content": "No party won a majority but Foreign Minister Sebastian Kurz, 31, is poised to head the government following tough coalition government negotiations.  DAVID GREENE, HOST: Austrians voted yesterday in a national election that could have profound implications for Europe. Preliminary results show they gave their millennial foreign minister Sebastian Kurz a mandate to form a new government. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) SEBASTIAN KURZ: (Speaking German). GREENE: Last night he told his supporters, we've done the impossible. Well, at least, it looks like it was the improbable. Let's talk about this with NPR's Soraya Sarhaddi Nelson who is in Vienna. And Soraya, how significant is this victory in Austria. SORAYA SARHADDI NELSON, BYLINE: Well, for one thing it could mean that this 31-year-old foreign minister is going to become the youngest head of government in Europe. It's important to note, though, that with 16 parties running yesterday in the parliamentary elections, Kurz did not - or I should say his People's Party did not get the majority needed for them to govern alone, which means that he would have to partner with another winner from yesterday's election in order to actually govern. And who that partner is, Kurz isn't really saying at the moment. But all indications are it's going to be this faction here that's very right wing and linked to former Nazis. It's called the Freedom Party of Austria. GREENE: Well, that's interesting. I mean, that sounds significant because the Freedom Party has not been in the Austrian government in years. I mean, like 17 years ago, there was an outcry and sanctions imposed by Brussels. I mean, so why would this new leader want to partner with them at this moment? NELSON: Well, for one thing the other faction that he could form a coalition with, which is a center-left Social Democratic Party, is the same party that his faction was in government with till recently. And they just broke up their partnership earlier this year, which is why there were even elections yesterday. It was a year early. So it's not really plausible for him to join with them now. On top of that, Kurz campaigned on the dangers of uncontrolled immigration to Austria and the need to get Muslim refugees and immigrants integrated into Austria or force them to leave. And that's the same platform the Freedom Party had. Although, of course, its message which was much more harsh and xenophobic and led many voters to go over to Kurz and his party. What's kind of clear from yesterday's vote is that with a majority of Austrians apparently embracing this anti-Islam, anti-refugee message, a partnership between Kurz's party and the Freedom Party might make sense. GREENE: But if you have a party that was linked to former Nazis being involved in the government, I mean, just that prospect - what has been the response been from outside Austria? NELSON: Well, it's been very much a wait-and-see-what-happens at least here in Europe. Although, the World Jewish Congress, very quickly last night after the polls closed, issued a statement protesting the fact that more than a quarter of Austrian voters would cast ballots for the Freedom Party. But the kind of backlash the Austrians faced in 2000 when the Freedom Party was last in government is not really expected this time, says Austrian political analyst and campaign consultant Thomas Hofer. THOMAS HOFER: I mean, in the year 2000, the whole world looked at Austria said you crazy guys, what are you doing? And now this is a phenomenon where Austria is not alone. I mean, they're right-wing wing populists all over the place. And now Austria is maybe considered to be some kind of bellwether state, but certainly not the outlaw in a sense that you say, OK. We have to block that because this is just crazy what's gone on in this country. You see right-wing populism now even in Germany, which nobody would have believed just a couple of years ago. NELSON: The People's Party told me or one of their officials told me that Kurz won't tolerate any anti-Semitism or anti-EU actions on the part of whatever partner it ends up pulling into the new government. GREENE: All right. NPR's Soraya Sarhaddi Nelson in Vienna talking to us about quite a political moment for Austria and maybe also for Europe as a whole.

            "article_content": "The French presidential runoff between the far-right National Front's candidate and that of the left-of-center is less than a week a way. The National Front holds its annual celebration on Monday.  RACHEL MARTIN, HOST: It's May Day, the international workers' holiday, and people are celebrating across Europe. In France, it's also the day the far-right holds its traditional rally. This year, the far-right has a candidate in the second round runoff of the French presidential election, now just six days away. We go to NPR's Eleanor Beardsley in Paris. Hi, Eleanor. ELEANOR BEARDSLEY, BYLINE: Hi, Rachel. MARTIN: This is an annual rally, but it's clearly taking on new importance with Marine Le Pen in the presidential runoff, right? BEARDSLEY: Absolutely. You know, this is the far-right's day, but it's hugely symbolic. This was once a small, marginal party. And now she's holding a massive rally on the outskirts of Paris later today that I'll be going to. This morning, her father is laying a small lily of the valley flower at Joan of Arc's statue - that's their traditional thing. She'll be staying far away from him. They've completely broken off relations. You know, she's been trying to modernize and mainstream this party, and he kept having these xenophobic and anti-Semitic outbursts. You know, he's the founder of the party. And she kicked him out of the party, actually, two years ago. MARTIN: So you say she's tried to make the party more mainstream. Has she been able to do that? BEARDSLEY: You know, Rachel, she has. Analysts say, you know, she's brought in a lot of young people, women. You go to her rallies now, and you used to just see, you know, like, workers, unemployed angry people. Now you see professionals. It's very, you know, middle class. And, you know, she's toned down some of her rhetoric, her anti-euro currency rhetoric. As it turns out, the French actually like the euro. And she says, we're not going to get out of the euro currency right away. And we're going to let our multinational companies keep using it. This weekend, Rachel, she was endorsed. A small, patriotic party formed an alliance with her. They got about 5 percent of the votes in the first round. But what's important is this gives her a really - a veneer of normalcy. It's going to make it much more palatable for voters to vote for, you know, Marine Le Pen now. Never before has a so-called mainstream party become an ally of the far-right. And people who really don't want to see Le Pen in power are scared. I spoke to Parisian Philippe Gibert (ph), and here's what he said. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) PHILIPPE GIBERT: I'm afraid. I'm afraid because, for the first time, we have to consider that the extreme-right party could be at the power. That's the very first time we have this feeling. And as far as I'm concerned, that's frightens me. We still have hope that Macron will be the next president. But we cannot avoid to consider that Le Pen has a chance. MARTIN: So are his fears justified? BEARDSLEY: Well, yes and no. It's still a long shot. Polls show that Macron has around 60 percent compared to Le Pen's 40 percent. But - well, here's what political commentator Thierry Arnaud says about the race. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) THIERRY ARNAUD: Let's make it clear that the Marine Le Pen win is a very unlikely scenario. But it is not an impossible one. For that to happen, you would have to have a very low turnout, a massive abstention by French standards. And let me remind you that about 80 percent of the French electorate usually goes to the polls for a presidential election. MARTIN: So what do you hear in that? BEARDSLEY: Well, Rachel, people are worried about abstention. You know, the last time the National Front made the second round was in 2002 with her father. And literally all of France got together and voted against him in the runoff. Jacques Chirac won, like, with more than 80 percent of the vote. But things are different this time around. You know, she's made the party more palatable. She's brought it more mainstream. What's known as the Republican Front, everyone against her, it's not happening anymore, as she's allied with a small party. And also, look - for example, today the unions are going out on May Day. They've all called on their voters not to support Le Pen, but they're split over whether to endorse Macron because, you know, many people consider Macron too capitalist. He's a former investment banker. Remember, the far left got nearly 20 percent of the vote in the first round. And their leader, Jean-Luc Melenchon, has not even endorsed Macron. Several days after the first round, after being called a sore loser, he finally came out and said, of course I'm not going to vote for Marine Le Pen. But he still has not said he will vote for Macron. So many people - there's this neither/nor, factor. We don't want Le Pen, but we don't want Macron either. So there are fears that there will be a lot of blank ballots cast or even, you know, people just not bothering to go vote at all. And that could really make this a close race, say analysts.

            "article_content": "Voters replaced candidates from the left and right parties which have dominated French politics for decades with outside candidates. There will be a runoff to determine who leads France in two weeks.  RACHEL MARTIN, HOST: We're going to talk about a political stunner that happened in France last night. Voters swept away mainstream left and right parties that have dominated French politics for decades, replacing them with outside candidates for a runoff in two weeks for the country's presidency. Emmanuel Macron, a centrist who has never held elective office, will face off against far-right candidate Marine Le Pen. For more on this political earthquake and what it means, we turn now to NPR's Frank Langfitt, who is in Paris for us. Hi, Frank. FRANK LANGFITT, BYLINE: Good morning, Rachel. MARTIN: What did voters seem to be saying yesterday with this decision? LANGFITT: Well, this was a complete rejection of the political establishment. The mainstream right and left wing parties have controlled the presidency since '58, but they haven't been able to solve France's problems. There's been chronic high unemployment here, political scandals. More recently, you know, you've seen a lot of industrial job loss because of global competition. Immigration's also been an issue. So basically, what voters were saying last night was, enough. MARTIN: How big a deal is this? LANGFITT: It's really a big deal. I mean, you know, we live in an age of hyperbole, but this is something else. I spent last night at Sciences Po Paris. It's one of France's top universities. And I was talking with a guy named Olivier Duhamel. He's a political scientist there. And he was - he found sort of the Macron victory stunning. He said imagine going back to, say, '92 in the U.S. in the race between George H. W. Bush and Bill Clinton if the independent candidate has won. Here's how he put it. OLIVIER DUHAMEL: In a way, it's like if Ross Perot or someone like that would have become president of the United States. It's like if neither a Republican, neither a Democrat would have won the election. This would have been absolutely incredible. That's what happened in France. LANGFITT: And, Rachel, a little more perspective on this. Macron just created his party last year. It largely exists online, doesn't hold a single elected office in the country. So it's hard to think of any analogy at all in a major Western democracy, say like the U.S. or the U.K., where something like this has happened. MARTIN: All right, so what do these candidates stand for? What kind of choice do the French face between Macron and Le Pen? LANGFITT: Well, they're polar opposites. Macron is 39. He's a former economy minister in the government here, political neophyte. He just doesn't have much background. He was a former investment banker, an internationalist. He's a big supporter of the European Union. Le Pen could not be more different. She's about a decade older. She grew up in far-right politics here. She's run sort of a France-first campaign, all about tightening borders, anti-immigrant stance, tough on terrorism. Of course, she wants to take France out of the EU. And each - depending on who won - each would take the country in a completely different direction. MARTIN: So it's interesting though, Frank, you said there's no real analogy in any other major Western democracy for what's happening in France. But this whole outsider thing is a bit of a trend right now. And it's hard to ignore what happened in our own U.S. election. LANGFITT: Absolutely. And here's where I would say there's a real common thread. It's this anti-establishment anger, which we saw in the Trump vote and, of course, the Brexit vote in the United Kingdom to leave the EU. But here in France, instead of going conservative, the French at least in this first round have gone - have backed a moderate globalist. And I was talking to Alain Dieckhoff - he's also at Sciences Po - last night. And he said that Macron's victory last night sends sort of an important message not only to the French but also more broadly to people in the world. Here's what he said. ALAIN DIECKHOFF: There are still very powerful forces within French society which are - we didn't want to really go in the direction of populist parties and of really xenophobic positions and so on. So this is rather something, I think, positive. MARTIN: So it'll be interesting to see who actually wins on the runoff on May 7. NPR's Frank Langfitt in Paris. Thanks so much, Frank.

            "article_content": "The leader of the Austria's far-right Freedom Party, Heinz-Christian Strache (left), and the leader of Austria's conservative People's Party, Sebastian Kurz, hold a joint press conference in Vienna on Saturday.\n                \n                    \n                    Roland Schlager/AFP/Getty Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption The leader of the Austria's far-right Freedom Party, Heinz-Christian Strache (left), and the leader of Austria's conservative People's Party, Sebastian Kurz, hold a joint press conference in Vienna on Saturday. Austria finalized a deal late Friday to make 31-year-old Sebastian Kurz Europe's youngest leader and to form a new governing coalition that will include a far-right party with Nazi roots. Exactly two months after Austrians went to the polls, Kurz struck a deal to join his conservative Austrian People's Party with the right-wing Freedom Party, led by Heinz-Christian Strache. Strache, who was once arrested for \"taking part in a Hitler Youth-style torchlit neo-Nazi rally,\" according to British newspaper The Telegraph, will serve as vice chancellor and minister for sports and public servants, and his nationalist Freedom Party will have members in several key leadership positions including the interior, defense and foreign ministries. The Austrian People's Party will have seven ministers and one deputy, and the Freedom Party will have five ministers and one deputy, according to the Associated Press. On Saturday morning, left-leaning Austrian President Alexander Van der Bellen did not object to the new governing coalition, reports NPR's Soraya Sarhaddi Nelson. He \"gave what looked like a forced smile in front of cameras,\" Nelson said, and cryptically told reporters \"as much as a morning can be good, I bid you good morning.\" Austria is governed by a parliamentary republic. A president is elected every six years as chief of state, but the head of government is the chancellor, who is the leader of the majority party. The new government is expected to be sworn in on Monday. Austria will become the only Western European country with a governing far-right party. Kurz is currently the country's foreign minister, and he has \"stressed the importance of a pro-European direction,\" according to the AP, although the Freedom Party, which has control of the foreign ministry, has traditionally been euroskeptic. Van der Bellen assured on Saturday, however, that in the party coalition negotiations, it was agreed upon to support a \"strong European Union.\" The People's Party received 31 percent of the votes in October's election, the most of any party. The Freedom Party, which was founded in the 1950s by a former Nazi minister, came in second place with 27 percent. Many have voiced concern over the Freedom Party having a prominent role in the country's government. \"It is sad and distressing that such a platform should receive more than a quarter of the vote and become the country's second party,\" said Ronald S. Lauder, the president of the World Jewish Congress, around the time of the election. \"It is still full of xenophobes and racists and is, mildly put, very ambiguous toward Austria's Nazi past.\"",
