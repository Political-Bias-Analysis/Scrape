Lindsey Graham said he thinks giving automatic citizenship to children of non-residents is a mistake. The immigration debate sparked by Arizona's controversial new law has revived calls to reconsider the Constitution's 14th Amendment. The amendment, ratified more than 140 years ago, grants automatic citizenship to nearly any child born in the U.S. Critics say it's an irresistible lure to illegal immigrants -- and needs to be revised.  Recently, it's been getting a lot of play on the cable news shows. Republicans Call For Senate Hearings CNN's Anderson Cooper recently tried to moderate opposing viewpoints over whether it's time to change the citizenship clause. The furor was touched off by Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina who said he thinks giving automatic citizenship to children of non-residents is a mistake. To have a child in America, they cross the border, they go to an emergency room, have a child and that child is automatically an American citizen. That shouldn't be the case \u2014 that attracts people here for all the wrong reasons. Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-SC) \"People come here to have babies,\" Graham said. \"They come here to drop a child -- it's called drop and leave. To have a child in America, they cross the border, they go to an emergency room, have a child and that child is automatically an American citizen. That shouldn't be the case -- that attracts people here for all the wrong reasons.\" Graham has been joined by other leading Republicans, including Sen. John McCain of Arizona and Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, in calling for Senate hearings on whether changes to the 14th Amendment are needed. They say not only are tourists taking advantage of the automatic citizenship clause, but so are illegal immigrants who use their citizen children to petition for legal residency. Many refer to these children of illegal immigrants as \"anchor babies.\" 'He Has Rights' Fatima Renteria says she's never heard the term \"anchor baby\" before. Her parents brought her to the U.S. illegally when she was 4 months old. She's now 22 and just had a baby of her own who is an automatic U.S. citizen. \"I don't even know how to reply to that without being too angry,\" she says. \"I didn't decide to just come here to have a baby here. I've been here my whole life, grew up and got married and decided to have a baby.\" I didn't decide to just come here to have a baby here. I've been here my whole life, grew up and got married and decided to have a baby. Fatima Renteria Renteria was in line in the admissions office of a Southern California community college, waiting to see a counselor. She says she wants to be a high school math teacher. She says illegal immigrants don't come to the United States to have babies -- they come to have a better life. She's upset that lawmakers would try and take away her son's citizenship rights. The 14th Amendment Section 1. All persons born or naturalized in the United States, and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States and of the State wherein they reside. No State shall make or enforce any law which shall abridge the privileges of immunities of citizens of the United States; nor shall any State deprive any person of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law, nor deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws. \"He has rights. He was born here. He has rights ... they can't just do that,\" she says. Repealing The Clause: A Radical Move Immigrant advocates say Republicans are creating a controversy to keep the issue of illegal immigration in the news through midterm elections in November. Elizabeth Wydra of the Constitutional Accountability Center says repealing the citizenship clause is too drastic a move and would mark the first time the Constitution would be amended to make it less egalitarian. \"While everyone recognizes that there are problems with our immigration system in this country, my perspective is: Let's try to fix this through legislation and not tinker with the genius of our constitutional design,\" she says. The 14th Amendment was ratified after the Civil War to ensure that children of freed slaves would be granted citizenship, and scholars say it is on solid legal ground. The Supreme Court upheld the amendment when it ruled in favor of a man born in the U.S. to Chinese immigrants and granted him citizenship back in 1892. But Rep. Brian Bilbray (R-CA) says it's been more than a century since the Supreme Court has weighed in on the issue -- and it's long overdue. Bilbray has been fighting since the 1990s to change the 14th Amendment citizenship clause. He says in these tough economic times, the law must be reviewed. \"When you say there's not enough to go around for those who are here legally -- or those playing by the rules -- you sort of say, 'Why do we continue to have an enticement to encourage people to break the law?'\" he says.",

            "article_content": "As the November midterm elections approach, the immigration issue has gone from simmer to full boil. Arizona is the reason. Gov. Jan Brewer, a Republican, is waiting to hear whether an appeals court will reinstate the most controversial elements of a state law designed to crack down on illegal immigration. Brewer's support for Arizona Senate Bill 1070 may be helping in her re-election bid. And now more Republicans are picking up the immigration mantle, hoping it will help them in November. Arizona Gov. Jan Brewer, who appears to have gotten a political boost from her support of the immigration law.\n                \n                    \n                    Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption Arizona Gov. Jan Brewer, who appears to have gotten a political boost from her support of the immigration law. Immigration has been one of the hottest topics on conservative talk radio programs. Just hours after U.S. District Judge Susan Bolton ruled Wednesday that key provisions of Senate Bill 1070 would have to be put on hold, a caller to host Peter Boyles' program on Denver station KHOW said the judge should be \"hung, impeached or fired.\" Security at the courthouse in Phoenix where Bolton works has been strengthened because of the threats she has  received. The local U.S. Marshals office says a lot of the threats were just people venting, but some are being investigated. The news out of Arizona is hitting home as far away as the small town of Summerville, S.C. There, City Councilman Walter Bailey wants to force employers to check immigration status of workers and landlords to check renters. On the campaign trail, Republicans are drawing particular attention to a May 20 speech that Mexico's President Felipe Calderon delivered to a joint session of Congress. As Calderon expressed his displeasure with Arizona\u2019s new law, saying it allows for racial profiling and that he agrees with President Obama that it should be overturned, Democrats stood up and applauded. Republicans remained seated. (See video of those moments in the player below or click here to watch it at C-SPAN.org.) In Colorado, Republican Senate candidate Ken Buck told a Tea Party gathering that if he\u2019s elected and a similar situation arises he will react even more strongly than his GOP colleagues did. \"I will stand up. I will turn my back and I will leave whatever chamber I am in,\" said Buck as the Elizabeth, Colo., audience erupted into applause. You can bet images of Democrats standing and applauding Calderon will show up in campaign ads soon, says former Colorado Rep. Bob Beauprez, a Republican. He says immigration already has been a key issue in the GOP primary in Colorado. \"The contestants are trying to appear, at least, tougher on the issue than their opponent,\" says Beauprez. \"Everybody's trying to one up the other one.\" Immigration is one of those hot-button issues that can mobilize voters -- as it did in the early stages of the 2008 Republican presidential primaries -- and that can be especially important in a midterm election when turnout is lower. The most controversial parts of the Arizona immigration law were put on hold by a judge, including this: \u2014 \"For any lawful contact made by a law enforcement official or agency of this state or a county, city, town or other political subdivision of this state where reasonable suspicion exists that the person is an alien who is unlawfully present in the United States, a reasonable attempt shall be made, when practicable, to determine the immigration status of the person.\" Source: www.azleg.gov But it's not just supporters of the Arizona law who are angry. Those who oppose it have vented their anger during street protests. It's not clear, though, that outrage over the law will prompt Latino voters to turn out in greater numbers than they did in the 2006 midterm election. Stanford political science professor Gary Segura does consulting and polling for Latino and Democratic-leaning organizations. He says many Latinos are discouraged because Obama hasn't yet made good on his campaign pledge to overhaul immigration laws. \"I would predict that Latino voter turnout in 2010 would be lower than Latino voter turnout in 2006,\" says Segura, \"which would be damaging for the Democrats.\" In the long term, Segura says, the immigration issue may hurt Republicans, as minorities make up an increasing share of the electorate. He points to the California experience in the wake of Proposition 187, which barred illegal immigrants from access to state services. It helped Republican Gov. Pete Wilson win re-election in 1994. But a backlash helped establish a Democratic majority in California that has proved difficult for Republicans to overcome. Now some are wondering if that same situation may be playing out in Arizona.",

Bush. The Washington Post reports: The Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency expects to deport about 400,000 people this fiscal year, nearly 10 percent above the Bush administration's 2008 total and 25 percent more than were deported in 2007. The pace of company audits has roughly quadrupled since President\u00a0George W. Bush's final year in office. The effort is part of\u00a0President Obama's larger project \"to make our national laws actually work,\" as he put it in a speech this month at American University. Partly designed to entice Republicans to support comprehensive immigration reform, the mission is proving difficult and politically perilous. This isn't exactly new news. There've been stories for months about the trend, including in the WaPo itself. Still there are many people who will be surprised to learn that deportations are higher under a liberal administration than a conservative one. What's changed has been the mix of deportations. The Bush Administration did more work-site raids with many of the illegal immigrants rounded up in those raids being deported. The Obama Administration has focused more on deporting illegal immigrants with criminal histories, especially violent ones. The Bush administration also went after criminals illegally in the U.S. but under Obama that has been ratcheted up. Both administrations got tough in their own ways because of the political realities. When he pushed an immigration overhaul in 2006 and 2007 that would have included a path to citizenship for illegal immigrants, Bush was rebuffed by an anti-amnesty backlash in Congress and the public. Critics angrily demanded that the administration enforce the immigration laws first, before trying \"rewarding\" those who entered the country illegally with eventual citizenship. The Republican administration responded with more work-site raids. Obama has indicated he plans to take on the challenge of an immigration overhaul before he face re-election. Like Bush, he faces the same pressures to crack down on illegal immigration if he is to have any hope of getting enough support to pass a legislative fix of the immigration laws. The increase in deportations is part of that strategy.",

            "article_content": "National Guard troops will head to the U.S.-Mexico border Aug. 1 for a yearlong deployment to keep a lookout for illegal border crossers and smugglers and help in criminal investigations, federal officials said Monday. Nearly half the troops will go to Arizona, with smaller groups bound for Texas, California and New Mexico. They will watch for and report illegal crossovers and smugglers. The troops will also help with investigations. They will carry weapons, but use them only to protect themselves. The troops will undergo initial training and be fully deployed along the nearly 2,000-mile southern border by September, Gen. Craig McKinley, chief of the National Guard Bureau, told a Pentagon news conference. The announcement provides details on how the government will implement President Obama's May decision to bolster border security and comes as drug-related violence has escalated in Mexico, where several people died over the weekend in a car bombing and in a separate massacre at a private party. It also comes as the U.S. debate over illegal immigration has intensified in an election year. \"The border is more secure and more resourced than it has ever been, but there is more to be done,\" said Alan Bersin, commissioner of Customs and Border Protection, part of the Homeland Security Department. The 1,200 troops will be distributed this way: Arizona, 524; Texas, 250; California, 224 and New Mexico, 72. Another 130 would be assigned to a national liaison office. In addition to the National Guard, the Homeland Security Department is sending more aircraft, surveillance equipment and at least 300 Customs and Border Protection agents. Bersin said the Homeland Security Department will provide six more aircraft, including helicopters, to the border. He said the agents and inspection officers would be sent to the Tucson area, along with mobile surveillance vans and additional technology. \"It will help,\" Arizona Attorney General Terry Goddard, a Democrat, said Monday in Santa Fe, N.M., where he was attending the annual meeting of the Conference of Western Attorneys General. \"Manpower clearly has been deficient. Technology has been somewhat deficient, and they're bolstering that.\" Arizona Gov. Jan Brewer, a Republican, said the deployment isn't enough \"nor tied to a strategy to comprehensively defeat the increasingly violent drug- and alien-smuggling cartels that operate in Arizona on a daily basis.\" U.S. Reps. Ann Kirkpatrick and Gabrielle Giffords, both Democrats from Arizona, separately called the announced actions welcome but insufficient. \"This is the kind of action we want from the administration -- not suing the state,\" Kirkpatrick said, referring to the Department of Justice's challenge to the new Arizona immigration enforcement law. \"However, we should continue to move forward with a much larger commitment of National Guard troops right away and with an expansion of the Border Patrol to strengthen security for the long run.\" President George W. Bush deployed 6,000 National Guard troops to the border for two years, ending in July 2008. McKinley said even though the four border states are contributing 54,000 troops to the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, they still have a sizable number available for other deployments or disaster response. More can be deployed at state cost if governors wish, but the 1,200 are being paid for by the federal government, he said. \"Right now I cannot see a case where we would be overextending the National Guard for this effort,\" he said. Immigration and Customs Enforcement also is beefing up its presence in Arizona, said John Morton, the Homeland Security Department assistant secretary overseeing the agency. Morton said ICE is opening a new office in Ajo, Ariz., to focus exclusively on cross-border crime and to deploy a specialized investigative team in Douglas, near where an Arizona rancher was murdered. Also, the agency will send ICE lawyers to U.S. attorneys offices to help prosecute felons who illegally re-enter the country after deportation. It also will increase the number of ICE agents in Mexico to 40, making it the largest of ICE's 63 offices in 44 countries. \"We are placing a particular emphasis on the Tucson sector in Arizona, an area favored by smugglers and the principal point of illegal entry into the United States along the southwest border,\" Morton said.",

Jan Brewer of Arizona. Since Arizona passed its law in April, polls have consistently found that a majority of Americans support it. Seyward Darby is the assistant managing editor of The New Republic. The New York Times reported Monday that Democratic governors are worried the White House's decision to sue Arizona over its controversial new immigration law could threaten their already-vulnerable party in November's elections. \"It is such a toxic subject,\" Tennessee Governor Phil Bredesen said of immigration, which is emerging as a key issue in this year's mid-terms. So what do the numbers show? Since Arizona passed its law in April, polls have consistently found that a majority of Americans support it. Last Thursday, Rasmussen found that 61 percent of people would support a similar law in their own states. And, last week, Gallup found that more people oppose the federal government's lawsuit than support it, by a margin of 50 percent to 33 percent. Seventy-nine percent of Republicans oppose the lawsuit, while 56 percent of Democrats favor it. Critically, 56 percent of independents oppose the suit -- and Gallup recently showed this bloc is already trending toward Republican candidates this election cycle. \"The immigration debate hits a really raw nerve with voters,\" says Jennifer Duffy of the Cook Political Report. Perhaps nowhere is this more apparent than in the border states. The Cook Report has listed the gubernatorial races in Texas, Arizona, New Mexico, and California as \"toss-ups,\" and a majority of people in the states oppose the Obama administration's lawsuit. Duffy says immigration has already played a big role in the states' primaries -- most notably helping Arizona Governor Jan Brewer, a Republican who signed the new immigration law, soar in her state's polls. \"I was not convinced she was going to win her own primary,\" Duffy says. \"Her numbers have skyrocketed since the law was passed, and, now, not only do I think she'll win the primary, but she'll have a better than fighting chance in the election.\" Attitudes about immigration are, like attitudes about any issue, a bit muddled once you look at other questions. In June, for instance, Gallup found that Americans were divided 50 percent to 45 percent over whether the government should focus primarily on stemming the flow of illegal immigrants, or on developing policies to deal with people already here illegally. And, in the long run, as Latinos become an ever larger share of the electorate, Democrats could stand to gain from the immigration issue. But for now and, more importantly, for November? Democratic governors are right to be worried.",

            "article_content": "Starting this fall, people hoping to go to Britain to either join their spouses or get married and immigrate will need to prove they can speak English. The requirement, announced Wednesday by the new conservative government of Prime Minister David Cameron, applies only to those from outside the European Union. The government said migrants will need to show they can speak English as well as a 7-year-old before they'll be granted a visa. This is in addition to proving their relationship is genuine and they are able to support themselves financially. \"I believe being able to speak English should be a prerequisite for anyone who wants to settle here,\" Home Secretary Theresa May said in a statement. \"The new English requirement for spouses will help promote integration, remove cultural barriers and protect public services.\" Officials estimate the new language test will cut visa applications by 10 percent, with those most affected coming from India, Pakistan and Bangladesh. The new measures have been criticized by civil libertarians, lawyers and activists. Some say the changes discriminate against people from countries with few English-speaking traditions, such as in Africa and Asia. Others call the rule an intrusion into citizens' private lives. The changes follow a hard-fought general election campaign in which immigration policy was a key, and contentious, issue. Currently, spouses are granted visas that allow them to go to Britain for about two years, after which they can apply for permanent residency -- which requires a citizenship and language test. \"Forcing husbands and wives to take language tests before they even arrive in the U.K. will rip families apart,\" said Hina Majid, the policy director of the Joint Council for the Welfare of Immigrants, a London-based advocacy group. \"These new rules are likely to hit people from South Asia and Africa, where English is not the main language. It may also hit women harder and discriminate most against the poorest.\" Besides, cultural integration is dependent on far more than just understanding certain words, said lawyer Danielle Cohen, whose London practice focuses on immigration and human rights. \"Being part of a culture is a gradual thing,\" Cohen said. \"Cultural barriers are not going to be lifted immediately just with the command of basic English.\" The measures were first tabled by Britain's Labour government in 2002. Last year, about 38,000 spousal visas were approved, and another 21,000 people were granted permanent residency. Cohen called the changes to the rules an intrusion into the personal lives of citizens. \"The problem for me with this measure is that I don't think the English language is a prerequisite for love,\" Cohen said. \"If you can communicate in your own language, what business is it of the state to interfere?\" But some Britons argue that it's only natural for newcomers to learn the language of their host nation. Dennis Weeks, a 38-year-old civil servant from east London, said he wouldn't be able to participate in another country's culture if he didn't speak the language, so it seems fair that immigrants to Britain learn some English. \"I don't think it is a bad thing. I think to be able to properly partake in a society and be involved with things with society, you're going to need to communicate,\" he said. \"So having a basic understanding of English must only be a good thing, surely.\" The move comes as countries across Europe tighten their rules on immigration amid rising unemployment rates and concerns about the ability of newcomers to integrate. The famously tolerant Netherlands was holding an election Wednesday in which a far-right party that wants to ban all immigration from non-Western countries has a shot at doubling its seats in Parliament.",

In advance of the midterm elections, weeks after Arizona passed a new immigration law, President Obama has decided to deploy 1,200 National Guard troops to the border between the U.S. and Mexico. According to The Arizona Republic, based in Phoenix, \"details have not been released on when they will arrive, where they will be stationed or how long they will stay. But their primary mission will be to assist with the battle against drug smugglers, working primarily on intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance until more Border Patrol agents can be hired and trained.\" On All Things Considered last night, NPR's Ted Robbins said that the plan is similar to what was implemented under Operation Jump Start: Soldiers made themselves visible as deterrents to would-be crossers. They did surveillance, drove vehicles, did office and motor pool support to free up border agents. They won't be performing law enforcement activities.

Barbara Boxer (D-CA). At the event, which added $600,000 to Boxer's campaign coffers and $1.1 million to the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee (DSCC), Obama \"had a little bit of something for everyone Tuesday at the Fairmont Hotel in San Francisco -- a tough message on the Gulf Oil spill, serious talk about immigration, jokes about bipartisanship, a comeback to a heckler, and even some self-depreciating humor about folks who put Hitler mustaches on his picture and say he's 'not as cool as he once was.'\" --The New York Times--\"BP Prepares for 'Top Kill' Procedure\": Later this morning, BP plans to \"inject thousands of pounds of heavy drilling fluids into a five-story-tall stack of pipes to clog the well.\" The Times explains what's at stake: A successful capping of the leaking well could finally begin to mend the company's brittle image after weeks of failed efforts, and perhaps limit the damage to wildlife and marine life from reaching catastrophic levels. A failure could mean several months more of leaking oil, devastating economic and environmental impacts across the gulf region, and mounting financial liabilities for the company. BP has already spent an estimated $760 million in fighting the spill, and two relief wells it is drilling as a last resort to seal the well may not be completed until August. The company says it will continue to make a live stream of the well available to the public during procedure, which has never been tried in such deep water. (Yesterday, Rep. Markey alleged BP would stop the feed today, while it attempted to clog the well.) BP will continue to provide a live video feed from the seabed through the diagnostic testing and top kill, if undertaken. Throughout the diagnostic process and top kill procedure very significant changes in the appearance of the flows at the seabed will be expected. These will not provide a reliable indicator of the overall progress, or success or failure, of the top kill operation as a whole. Hank Stuever, television critic for The Washington Post, reviews the so-called \"spillcam\" in today's paper: Spillcam combines the dread of horror films with the monotony of Andy Warhol's eight-hour silent movie of the Empire State Building. There is no sound and nothing happens, except the inexorable, unending flow. You watch a little, and then a little more, and then you can't stop watching as a steady plume of dark brown oil belches upward from the floodlit, rocky ocean floor. --ESNP--\"NY/NJ has it down cold as XLVIII host\": The 2014 Super Bowl will take place in the $1.6 billion New Meadowlands Stadium, the NFL announced yesterday at its spring meeting.

When asked what his biggest concern is as he goes to vote in Britain's election Thursday, Michael Simons doesn't hesitate: \"Immigration,\" he says, \"jobs and the financial situation.\" Simons, who has lived in the tiny village of Winsley in deepest rural Wiltshire for the past 30 years, is not alone in his concerns, which reflect the fears of large swathes of Britain's rural, mostly white population. The man he is speaking to is the Conservative candidate for the constituency, Wilfred Emmanuel-Jones, who is nodding attentively. \"What we need,\" says Emmanuel-Jones, \"is a cap on immigration for people coming from outside the European Union.\" Surprisingly for a Conservative candidate in this part of Britain, Emmanuel-Jones is black. Born in Jamaica, he moved to Britain at age 4 and grew up in a poor inner-city household in Birmingham, the eldest of eight children. From there he worked his way up, after several years working for the BBC, to set up a successful farm business under the name The Black Farmer. The residents of Winsley don't seem at all bothered by the color of his skin; they are more interested in his firmly Conservative stance on key issues such as immigration and Britain's massive deficit. \"After the election, the reality is going to set in that we've got a massive debt to sort out, which means that there are going to have to be cuts, that there's going to have to be a subconscious change in the way that we think,\" Emmanuel-Jones says. \"The idea that you've got this big state who's there to look after us and care for us ain't going to happen, and people have to realize that.\" Despite the enthusiasm in rural villages for this Conservative line, and the need to make cuts to Britain's welfare state, Emmanuel-Jones still has a fight on his hands. Race may not be an issue, but after a recent scandal in Parliament about how politicians claimed their expenses, there is anger at politics-as-usual, which generally means the two-party politics of the Conservatives and the ruling Labour Party. This has worked in favor of the third party, the Liberal Democrats, which has also received a boost from the strong performances of its leader, Nick Clegg, in Britain's first televised debates in recent weeks. At a school in the nearby town of Chippenham, Emmanuel-Jones takes on three other candidates, taking questions from a hall full of high school seniors, many of whom are first-time voters. One of his opponents is his closest rival in the campaign to represent Chippenham in Parliament: Duncan Hames of the Liberal Democrats. Hames is an impressive, Oxford-educated accountant, whose responses to a wide range of questions are applauded by the audience. His answers reveal the moderate centrist approach of the Liberal Democrats, presenting themselves as the outsiders as they try to attract voters disenchanted with the left-of-center Labour Party and the right-of-center Conservatives.  \"There are some big differences,\" Hames says. \"But some of the differences in the political outlook of the candidates are smoothed over by the [central] PR operations of the political parties. \"Some of the things my Conservative opponent says about his ideological attitude to the public sector are things that you would never hear [Conservative Party leader] David Cameron say.\" But Emmanuel-Jones is unrepentant, sticking to his staunch conservatism, repeating that he is the one being honest, and that voters just need to deal with the truth. On his way out of the debate, he is accosted by a young student, angry over what he sees as the Conservative Party's abandoning of the poor. \"I don\u2019t need you to tell me about poverty,\" Emmanuel-Jones retorts. The student interrupts, and after trying to answer the question several times, Emmanuel-Jones gives up, shakes a few more hands and heads for the exit. After all the lamenting in the media that this election, dominated by TV debates and media sound bites, is being fought too much on personalities and not enough on policies, it's clear that at the grass roots, policies count as much as they ever did before.",

On Jan. 12, a magnitude 7.0 earthquake struck Haiti. The next day, Haitian-American singer Wyclef Jean arrived to find the country of his birth in ruins. The experience led him to ramp up his charitable efforts -- and eventually, to throw his hat in the ring to become the country's president. Haitian elections are Sunday, but the name Wyclef Jean won't appear on the ballot. His permanent residence in New Jersey disqualified him. It's been a whirlwind year for Jean, and he's put it all down in song. His latest EP, If I Were President: My Haitian Experience, will be released in a couple weeks. Jean says he writes a song a day, but it took him a while to begin writing about the carnage he witnessed in Haiti. \"After the quake, picking up bodies on the ground, seeing children being brought to morgues. I came back to the states -- it really was post-trauma stress. I really didn't feel it till weeks later,\" he tells Weekend All Things Considered guest host Audie Cornish. \"My only therapy was getting a pen and a paper and just expressing what I felt.\" Jean says music helps him to make sense of what is happening in his country. \"I think in the same way that music helped Bob Marley make sense of what was happening in his country at the time, you know. ... The way that I can get people to pay attention is through these real melodic tones,\" he says. \"And hope once I hypnotize them inside of the tone, they can start paying attention to what's going on.\" The new EP draws tones and influences from a diverse mix of artists. On the song, \"Election Time,\" Jean uses tape from both Fela Kuti's \"Zombie,\" and Pink Floyd's \"Brick in the Wall.\" \"You know with my brain -- the Wyclef Jean brain -- they call me Mr. Eclectic,\" Jean says with a laugh. \"But they meet ... in a political space ... because Fela was very political in his country, you know? When Nigeria was going through a bad time, he used his music to transform his message.\" Jean's experience in Haiti after the earthquake not only inspired his music, but also his political aspirations. Jean says despite his official residency in New Jersey, he should have been allowed to run for president in Haiti because he has residency there, too. \"In the Haitian constitution, it says that you have to have had residence in the country in the course of five years. [You must have] a domain, meaning a piece of property that you're paying taxes on to show that you have business which is active and you're coming in the country back and forth,\" he says. \"If this was not the case, the entire parliament couldn't run for office, because half of the year they're in Miami. The law has to apply for everyone, not just one group of people.\" Being ineligible to run for president hasn't stopped Jean from working in the country. His charity, Yele Haiti, is working with the nonprofit group Partners in Health to help with the recent cholera outbreak. \"My work in Haiti has not even started,\" he says.",

            "article_content": "The message of Democrat Jerry Brown's win in the California governor's race over billionaire Republican Meg Whitman appears to be one that has been seen before in the state, that the candidate who spends the most money doesn't necessarily come away with the most votes. At a time when there are so many concerns about the corrupting influence of money in politics, it's a message many people will welcome. Brown, who was elected the state's youngest governor since the 1850s when he was first elected to the chief executive's job in 1975, is now the oldest person elected governor at age 72. The one-time seminarian is also the former mayor of Oakland and is California's attorney general. He's also the son of Edmund \"Pat\" Brown who also served as California governor. In a year when voters demanded change, he successfully made the case for experience. Whitman, who spent more than $140 million of her own fortune on the campaign couldn't seem to overcome the impression that she was trying to buy the race. She also had some major self-inflicted wounds, especially after news broke that she had employed for nine years an undocumented immigrant. Whitman's version of the story conflicted with her former housekeeper's who in an emotional news conference accused the former eBay CEO of throwing her under the bus for political reasons. Whitman's loss was reminiscent of the 1994 Senate run in California by Michael Huffington, a former Congressman who spent a then-record $28 million back then for his unsuccessful run and the ex-husband of Huffington Post founder Arianna Huffington. In another eerie similarity to Whitman, his bid was also hurt by the revelation that his family had hired an undocumented immigrant as a nanny.",

            "article_content": "California's race for governor is too close to call, because after spending $140 million or more, 54-year-old Republican candidate Meg Whitman has yet to put away her 72-year-old Democratic opponent, Jerry Brown, who was elected governor of the state for the first time when he was half his present age. On one side, Republican candidate Meg Whitman.\n                \n                    \n                    Pool/Getty\n                    \n                \nhide caption Brown, now the state's attorney general, has been hanging in there, despite having to apologize for an aide who used the word \"whore\" in a discussion of Whitman's relationship to a police union. Brown saved most of the $32 million he raised for the last weeks, while Whitman has spoken of supplementing the roughly $20 million she has raised for her first run at elected office with as much as $150 million of her own. On the other side, Democratic gubernatorial candidate Jerry Brown. Why not put them together?\n                \n                    \n                    Rich Pedroncelli/Associated Press\n                    \n                \nhide caption Whitman's campaign has been troubled, not only by the staggering weight of its media buys but also by her story of employing an undocumented worker unawares. Given the salience of the immigration issue in California, this episode has raised as many eyebrows as the sexual allegations against Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger did when he first ran in 2003. Brown and Whitman each have much to offer on the positive side, too, of course, and in the end they are probably the smartest pair of major-party nominees for governor anywhere in the country. So why does either one want to run a state with a population approaching 40 million, seemingly insuperable problems and a paralyzing partisan split in its power structure? Some say the campaign has been so negative and nasty that both deserve to lose. But wouldn't it be far more fitting punishment if both won? It's just a modest proposal no one's admitted to thinking of before: Sacramento with not one but two governors. Partners. Co-governors. An executive tag team. Make them work out their differences before proposing a budget, or flip a coin before making an appointment or commuting a death sentence. At a minimum, it would make great reality TV. NPR's Ken Rudin, on The Election Scorecard: California's gubernatorial race \"is still a toss-up.\" (One caveat: We couldn't stage it in the governor's mansion. Brown passed on living there when he was governor in the 1970s and rented an apartment. For her part, Whitman can probably afford something much nicer.) Sure, they're going to remain at odds after the ballots are counted and they've both been declared the winner. But what difference would that make in Sacramento? Who would notice? This is a state where keeping officeholders at war with each other is practically part of the Constitution. And besides, as a tandem, they might be able to at least talk to both sides of the divide, even if they can't bring them together. That puts them one step ahead of the last few governors. After all, here you have a woman and a man, a business perspective and a government perspective, a hands-on doer and a world-class talker, a Republican and a Democrat, someone who made a billion on the Internet, and someone who started his education training to be a Jesuit priest. This is covering quite a few of the bases. This fall, the big miracle in Sacramento was the enactment of a budget more than three months late. The nominally Republican Schwarzenegger has been at war with the heavily Democratic state legislature throughout his seven years in office. And when either side has tried to end-run the other with ballot initiatives and other maneuvers, it's usually worked. Civic-spirited or high-minded efforts to break the logjam? Not so much. Much of the credit or blame, to be fair, goes to the voters themselves. They have repeatedly enacted laws of their own through ballot initiatives that force the state to spend on certain programs (such as education) while also limiting its power to tax anyone to pay for it. The state continues to cling to its Proposition 13, which limits revenue from property tax increases and favors long-time property owners over more recent ones. It also requires a two-thirds majority to raise taxes. That's a high bar considering that most Republican legislators would rather resign. But that's just for starters, the state also has a voter-enacted provision that requires a super-majority each year for the adoption of a state budget. It's a marvelous notion to induce compromise and consensus, but as a practical matter it is a disaster nearly every year. And it hamstrings public governance of an economy that would rank eighth in the world if California were a country. A generation of gerrymandering, raised to an art by computerized line drawing, has created too many llegislative districts the Democrats cannot lose and too many the GOP cannot lose. Therefore, each party's primaries tend to produce the most partisan, least-compromising candidates available for the fall (when the outcome in each district is all but a foregone conclusion). Who can be surprised when these people get to the Capitol and turn out to be hard liners? Given all this, what would be more appropriate than a standoff in the governor's office suite, too?",

            "article_content": "With two weeks to go, it looks like the GOP will wind up with a majority of the nation's 50 governorships; the present lineup is 26 D, 24 R.\u00a0 At least nine governors currently represented by Democrats are likely to end up in Republican hands.\u00a0 Right now I see Iowa, Kansas, Michigan, New Mexico, Oklahoma, Pennsylvania, Tennessee, Wisconsin and Wyoming switching to the GOP, and the possibility remains that Illinois, Maine, Ohio and Oregon could join them. Check out ratings for Senate and House matchups, as well as how other political watchers are calling the races. But Democrats look poised to win back the governorships in five states --\u00a0Connecticut, Hawaii, Minnesota, Rhode Island and Vermont -- with California and Florida no worse than even to do so as well. Here's some recent observations: California:\u00a0 This is still a tossup race, but in the controversies over \"Nannygate\" (the undocumented immigrant who spent nine years working for Meg Whitman's family until she was fired in 2009) and \"Whoregate\" (a member of the Jerry Brown campaign suggested the word \"whore\" be thrown at Whitman for her dealings with a labor union), Brown seems to have come out on top.\u00a0 The contretemps came at a time when momentum was seemingly headed in Whitman's direction.\u00a0 Still tossup, slight lean to Brown. Colorado:\u00a0 If anything, the story here may be that Tom Tancredo, the former Republican congressman and presidential candidate who is running on a third party line, may finish ahead of the GOP nominee, Dan Maes.\u00a0 NPR's Jeff Brady says that it is not out of the realm of possibility that Maes could finish with under ten percent of the vote, making the GOP officially a \"minor\" party in the Centennial State.\u00a0 The Democratic nominee, Denver Mayor John Hickenlooper, is all but assured of winning. Florida:\u00a0 What I came away with most during my two-day visit to Tallahassee last week is that Republican Rick Scott and Democrat Alex Sink are two flawed candidates in a dead heat.\u00a0 Scott seems to be a better and more relaxed campaigner, but he has serious baggage from his former stint as CEO of a hospital chain that paid a $1.7 billion fine for Medicare fraud.\u00a0 If \"change\" is the operative word in Florida, Scott, the anti-politician/first-time candidate/Tea Party favorite, wins.\u00a0 If it's about ethics and trustworthiness, Sink wins. Georgia:\u00a0 People tell me that if this were any other year, Roy Barnes (D) beats Nathan Deal (R) and wins his old job back.\u00a0 But not in a year with everything going the GOP's way.\u00a0 I'm still keeping this as a Tossup, for now. Maine:\u00a0 There seems to be a surge for independent candidate Eliot Cutler in a state that has elected two independent governors over the past quarter century.\u00a0 But for the most part, Cutler is advancing at the expense of the Democratic nominee, Elizabeth Mitchell ... which could elect GOP candidate Paul LePage.\u00a0 Tossup for now, with slight advantage for LePage. New Mexico: Republican Susana Martinez has opened up a slight lead over Democratic Lt. Gov. Diane Denish, who has served with term-limited (and now unpopular) Gov. Bill Richardson for eight years. New York:\u00a0 Carl Paladino (R) makes great copy but this race is nowhere to being competitive.\u00a0 State Attorney General Andrew Cuomo (D), hardly Mr. Popular, wins this going away. Ohio:\u00a0 There is a sense that Gov. Ted Strickland (D), on the losing end of polls in his battle with former Rep. John Kasich (R), may be closing the gap.\u00a0 But even with Kasich up for most of the year, I had this as a Tossup, and it stays there for now. Oregon:\u00a0 Can former NBA player Chris Dudley (R) really be making a race out of it with former Democratic Gov. John Kitzhaber (D)?\u00a0 That's what polls say but it's hard to fathom.\u00a0 Nonetheless, I'm moving this from Democrat Favored to Tossup.\u00a0 But I still think Kitzhaber wins. Texas:\u00a0 Democrats are giddy about the chances of former Houston Mayor Bill White.\u00a0 I do think the race is within single digits but that Gov. Rick Perry wins again.

Joe Manchin, the Democratic candidate for the Senate, \"does whatever Obama wants.\"\u00a0 He's \"not bad as governor, but when he's with Obama ... he turns into 'Washington Joe.'\" It's not a bad commercial.\u00a0 President Obama was never popular in West Virginia.\u00a0 He got trounced in the Democratic primary by Hillary Clinton, 67-26 percent.\u00a0 He lost to John McCain in the general election by a 56-43 percent margin.\u00a0 And that's when the Obama Brand was at its peak. So linking Manchin, the popular Democratic governor, to Obama is (1) not a stretch and (2) an effective strategy.\u00a0 Some polls show the GOP nominee, businessman John Raese, actually ahead of Manchin in a state that hasn't sent a Republican to the Senate since 1956 ... even though Manchin is anti-abortion, pro-gun and the kind of social conservative that is popular in the Mountain State.\u00a0 If Raese is truly ahead, this could be a bigger GOP rout than previously expected. But, as Politico reported, the Republican consulting firm that did the ad, Jamestown Associates, sent out a casting call to a talent agency for the commercial.\u00a0 Under \"wardrobe,\" it said, \"We are going for a \u2018Hicky\u2019 Blue Collar look. These characters are from West  Virginia so think coal miner/trucker looks.\"\u00a0 There was more: Each character should bring a several options and stay away from all black or  all white or thin stripes (thicker stripes and plaid are good) - Clothing Suggestions: \u2022 Jeans \u2022 Work boots \u2022 Flannel shirt  \u2022 Denim shirt \u2022 Dickie's type jacket with t-shirt underneath \u2022 Down  filled vest \u2022 John Deer hats (not brand new, preferably beat up) \u2022  Trucker hats (not brand new, preferably beat up) \u2022 No Thin  Stripes Humiliated, the NRSC pulled the ad.\u00a0 It no longer can be found on YouTube.\u00a0 But CBS News' Political Hotsheet has the ad here. (Scroll further down in this blogpost to see an Update on this story.) A quick unscientific study at reaction on the blogosphere has mostly been giving the Republicans the benefit of the doubt.\u00a0 One wrote the following on the Politico blog: Anyone who's been in show biz knows these calls are typically descriptive.  You have to be able to describe exactly what it is you're looking for so actors  have the best shot at the job, and advertisers don't waste their time. This one is very, very typical. Unions in the business (SAG, AFTRA) know  their purpose, and give actors tips on how to meet the descriptions casting  calls put out. I'm surprised people would take issue with financially-pressed  union actors getting these great spots. It's good money, for the actor and the  union. Not surprising that Northeast liberal elitist political consultants or media  types might find \"blue collar\" and \"beat up hat\" insulting and derogatory. West  Virginians are proud of their humble, salt-of-the-earth roots, including their  John Deere hats and work boots. And Greg Sargent, writing in the Washington Post, says it's unfair to blame the NRSC for this: What seems to have happened is that the NRSC's independent expenditure unit  -- which is walled off from the NRSC strategic offices -- asked one of its  vendors to round up the actors for the ad. That vendor is Jamestown Associates,  which then contacted a Philadelphia talent agency in hopes of getting actors for  the ad. Someone at that talent agency -- whose name is undetermined as of now --  used the language in an email sent around looking for actors. If this is the case, then the language wasn't even used by anyone at the  entity that was contracted by the NRSC. As for the actors themselves,  actors appear in ads on both sides -- it's the \"hicky\" language that made this a  story. But that hasn't stopped the left from jumping all over it.\u00a0 Jon Walker, writing on the Firedoglake blog, said it was time to \"remind\" the NRSC \"that working class Americans don\u2019t like it when people call them hicks behind  their backs, especially when the epithets come from out-of-state political  operatives.\" And the Manchin campaign demanded an apology from Raese: John Raese and his special interest friends have insulted the people of West  Virginia and need to immediately apologize. Not only have they been spending  millions to try and buy this election with lies and distortions, we can now see  once and for all what he and his friends really think of West Virginia and our  people. It's offensive and it only proves that John Raese has spent too much  time in the state of Florida, living in his Palm Beach mansion, and doesn't  know, understand or respect the great people of this state, and what we stand  for. It may not matter that the Raese campaign or the NRSC never had anything to do with the \"hicky\" language.\u00a0 The flap works well for Manchin and the Democrats, writes The Atlantic's Nicole Allen, \"who have been painting Raese as a wealthy outsider disconnected from the state's  working identity. The NRSC's rapid reaction also plays into the Democrats'  hands, making the organization seem disconnected from on-the-ground campaign  work and the needs of individual states.\" UPDATE:\u00a0 A look at the correspondence sent out by Jamestown Associates in search of actors for the commercial , supplied to us by the NRSC, shows absolutely no mention of the word \"hicky\" or anything of the sort.\u00a0 It was, in fact, the talent agency that received the request from Jamestown that decided on its \"hicky\" language.\u00a0 As NRSC executive director Rob Jesmer wrote today, \"That word was written by a non-political, sub-contractor without any knowledge of any vendor paid for the NRSC.\"\u00a0 Jesmer saved his harshest words for Politico's Mike Allen, who wrote the original story: I have great respect for Mike Allen but he should be  embarrassed that he wrote this.\u00a0 We spent most of Tuesday giving him everything  we could to verify that this came from an entity not associated with us.\u00a0 We  pleaded with him to be fair and think about the consequences of injecting this  into the campaign 26 days before the election. \u00a0He knowingly disregarded this  and went ahead and wrote it, breaking the cardinal rule of journalism\u2026don\u2019t make  the news, cover the news. But Politico just cannot pass up this kind of thing; they are  intensely interested in sensationalized headlines and tabloid political  journalism.\u00a0 As it relates to the West Virginia story, they succeeded in their  endeavor. An account of this story by the Huffington Post, no friend of the NRSC, backs up Jesmer's argument. ... The other incident came in the California gubernatorial contest.\u00a0 Democrats seemed to get an opening when it was learned that GOP candidate Meg Whitman had employed an undocumented worker for nine years and, when she learned about that person's status in 2009, she fired her on the spot.\u00a0 Jerry Brown, the Democratic candidate, managed to put the focus on how Whitman treats employees, thwarting Whitman's desire to talk about how she would bring jobs to California. A new poll had Brown leading the race by four points; not long ago the two candidates were tied. But then came this. The Los Angeles Times has revealed that in a private conversation that was inadvertently taped by a voicemail machine, Brown \"can be heard referring to his Republican opponent Meg Whitman as a 'whore' for  cutting a deal protecting law enforcement pensions as the two candidates  competed for police endorsements\": The  comment came after Brown called the Los Angeles Police Protective League in  early September to ask for its endorsement. He left a voicemail message for  Scott Rate, a union official. Brown apparently believed he had hung up the  phone,\u00a0but the connection remained intact and the voice mail machine captured an  ensuing conversation between Brown and his aides. With  evident frustration, Brown discussed the pressure he was under to refuse to  reduce public safety pensions or lose law enforcement endorsements to Whitman.  Months earlier, Whitman had agreed to exempt public safety officials from key  parts of her pension reform plan. \u201cDo we  want to put an ad out? \u2026 That I have been warned if I crack down on pensions, I  will be \u2013 that they\u2019ll go to Whitman, and that\u2019s where they\u2019ll go because they  know Whitman will give \u2018em, will cut them a deal, but I won\u2019t,\u201d Brown said. At that  point, what appears to be a second\u00a0voice interjects: \u201cWhat about saying she\u2019s a  whore?\u201d \u201cWell,  I\u2019m going to use that,\u201d Brown responds. \u201cIt proves you\u2019ve cut a secret deal to  protect the pensions.\u201d You can hear the recording on the above-referenced Times link. The Whitman campaign responded today: The HotAir blog had perhaps the most charitable thing to say about Brown: Look  on the bright side.\u00a0 It\u2019s an improvement over Jerry Brown\u2019s earlier  comment comparing Meg Whitman to Nazi propaganda minister Josef Goebbels. Perhaps the Brown campaign, realizing the potential for trouble, today decided to trot out the endorsement of his candidacy by the National Organization for Women.\u00a0 Los Angeles Times' Anthony York writes, \"Coincidence? You be the judge.\" (For the record, Brown spokesman Sterling Clifford \"dismissed suggestions there was any connection between the timing of the  endorsement and the audio tape saying, 'there's no endorsement process that can  be done in a day.'\") John Wildermuth, blogging at the San Francisco Chronicle, suggests that both candidates could \"be burned\" by this: The last thing Brown needs is a reputation for running a frat-boy style  campaign shop where people have no problem tossing out slurs against women when  they think no one -- that is, female voters -- is listening. Women make up about 53 percent of the likely voters in California and  typically can be trusted to lean toward Democratic candidates. But a Field Poll  last month showed Brown and Whitman locked in a 41-41 dead heat, both among all  likely voters and among women. Brown needs to pump up his female support to win  in November and this isn't going to help. On the other hand, Whitman has been slamming Brown as a lapdog for the  state's public employee unions and painting herself as the one candidate who can  save California financial future by cracking down on those overpaid -- and  over-pensioned -- union sorts. But the same diatribe that led to the \"whore\" insult also had Brown, in that  private, unscripted moment, saying he was going to lose an important endorsement  because he wasn't willing to give a special pension break to a law enforcement  union. More importantly, it didn't show him backing away from his stand, even if  it cost him the endorsement. Which goes to show you that, in the West Virginia and California campaigns -- and elsewhere -- nothing is certain until the voters speak, 25 days from today.",

            "article_content": "California Republican gubernatorial candidate Meg Whitman, and Moises Marino, her campaign's Latino field director, display a poster targeted at Hispanic voters, August 4, 2010, in Los Angeles.\u00a0\n                \n                    \n                    Damian Dovarganes/AP Photo\n                    \n                \nhide caption It would be hard to find stronger proof that former President George W. Bush's dream of pulling significant numbers of Latinos into the Republican Party has been pretty much dashed than the newly released poll from Pew Hispanic Center. The poll indicates that Latinos have cast their lot with the Democratic Party and not in a tentative way. According to the poll, 65 percent of Latinos expected to support the Democrat in their local congressional races compared with 22 percent who planned to support the Republican. Those numbers bore some resemblance to the 67 percent of Hispanics who supported President Barack Obama in 2008 versus the 31 percent who voted for Sen. John McCain. McCain's percentage compared with 44 percent who voted for Bush's re-election in 2004 compared with the 35 percent of Latinos who voted for him in 2000. For Republicans, one finding that could prove especially troubling is contained in the response to the question, which party is more concerned about Latinos? Latino respondents said it was the Democratic Party and not by a small margin. It was 44 percent to six percent. Worth pointing out is that the percentage of Latinos saying Democrats were more concerned about them than Republicans dropped significantly. It was 55 percent in 2008. (It was essentially unchanged at 6 percent between 2008 and 2010 for Republicans.) But that still leaves a sizable difference between how Hispanics view Democrats and Republicans. Meanwhile, the trend for Republicans is going in the wrong direction. Eleven percent of Latino respondents thought the Republican Party had more concern for them in 2002 than the Democrats did. Since voters presumably vote their interests, to have a significant and growing number of them believe that your party is less concerned about people like them than the opposing party is nothing short of political poison. Republicans had good reason to believe at the start of the last decade that they could make real inroads with Latino voters. Generally speaking, many Hispanic voters tended to be more conservative socially -- religious and opposed to abortion and gay marriage -- and entrepreneurial. The thinking among Republican strategists was that these qualities would make these voters more receptive to the GOP's anti-abortion and anti-tax message. But something happened along the way. Many analysts in recent years have pinned it on resistance within the Republican Party to overhauling the nation's immigration laws and providing a path towards citizenship for immigrants who illegally entered or stayed in the country is the answer. And not only has their been resistance to providing a citizenship path but recent GOP efforts, like Arizona's recently passed anti-illegal immigrant law likely isn't helping the Republican Party boost its image with Hispanics. Some Latino citizens have said they detect intolerance in the nativist rhetoric used by some on the side of cracking down hard on undocumented immigrants. On the other side, when you look at the data in the Pew survey, you can understand whatever Republican reluctance exists to creating a path to citizenship. Assuming the voting patterns among the undocumented would, once they became legal, follow those of current Latino citizens, Republicans could be locking in their electoral disadvantages in parts of the country with significant Hispanic populations. Meanwhile, any move towards giving undocumented voters legal status wouldn't be popular with the Republican base. (It also wouldn't be popular with some in the Democratic base but that's a different story.) This is not a theoretical fear. One reason Republicans lost the House in 2006 was because of a GOP-base backlash to Bush Administration and the Republican Congress' attempt to achieve bipartisan immigration reform. Thus Republicans continue to have a real dilemma on their hands. To effectively court Latino voters, an important and growing part of the American electorate, would mean to find a way to be tough on border enforcement and the problem of undocumented workers without resorting to language or actions that seem intolerant. It's a tall order. But it may be the only way to get the party back on track towards broadening and diversifying its base in the way Bush had hoped for and, indeed, achieved some success.",

            "article_content": "To mobilize Hispanic voters in November, big labor and advocates of liberal efforts at overhauling immigration laws have announced a $300,000 ad campaign attacking Republican Senators for blocking passage of the so-called DREAM Act. The ad will air on Spanish-language radio stations in Arizona, Florida, Nevada and other states with large Latino populations. The effort was conceived and funded by the Service Employees International Union, Mi Familia Vota and America's Voice, which say the $300,000 is the most ever spent on a Spanish-language radio campaign by groups such as theirs to make their case on immigration. Arizona's controversial immigration law sparked protests in other places earlier this year, as at this rally in New York City on May 1. Now, some groups are protesting the Senate's failure to pass the DREAM Act.\n                \n                    \n                    Spencer Platt/Getty Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption A solid Hispanic turnout could tip a number of close races, but Latinos, like many other voters who traditionally lean toward Democratic candidates, have yet to strongly engage in this election season. Because Latinos overwhelmingly support efforts to overhaul the nation's immigration laws, organizers hope the ad campaign can shake them from their malaise. The DREAM Act became ready fodder when it died in the Senate on Sept. 22 after Democrats failed to get a single Republican to vote in support, including among from Republicans who had favored the measure in the past. \"For us, it really starts with the sense that fixing the economy requires fixing or reforming our broken immigration system,\" SEUI spokesman Teddy Davis says. \"We need to stop exploiting our undocumented workers or it's going to drag down the floor on all workers. So it has an impact on everyone.\" The DREAM Act would establish a path to citizenship for undocumented immigrants younger than 36 who arrived in the United States as children, have lived here for five years or more, and are attending college or serving in the military. More than 800,000 of the estimated 11 million illegal immigrants in the nation could have been eligible. Here's an English translation of the Voices of Dream Act Youth radio ad: \"What would you do if a group of politicians were denying your hopes, your dreams? \"Thousands of us have taken to the streets to fight for what's right: access to a college education and a path to citizenship. \"We're the undocumented students of the DREAM Act \u2026 the sonadores. \"Without papers, and without fear, we fight so our generation doesn't get left behind. \"But who opposed this bill? Who wants to quash our dreams? \"Republicans. The same people who opposed the extension of unemployment benefits. \"Republicans. Who try to deny immigrant rights in Arizona and other states. \"Republicans. Who always seem to stand with big corporations against working families. \"President Obama, the armed forces, chambers of commerce, universities and a majority of the public are on our side. \"And they need our help. \"This November 2nd, in (STATE NAME) -- vote for the candidates who support our families, and make our dreams come true. \"This ad is paid for by the Service Employees International Union, Mi Familia Vota Civic Participation Campaign and America's Voice.\" The Defense Department has said the act could help it maintain \"a mission-ready, all-volunteer force.\" Versions of the bill have been debated in Congress over the past decade and previously received the support of several Republican senators, including John McCain of Arizona and Lindsey Graham of South Carolina. But last week Republicans, in voting against it, accused Democrats of playing politics to curry favor with voters ahead of Election Day by attaching the legislation to a Defense appropriations bill. Also included was a repeal of the military\u2019s \"don't ask, don't tell\" policy that bars openly homosexual men and women from serving in the armed forces. Advocates of the DREAM Act legislation say last week's vote imperils chances for comprehensive immigration reform, particularly given the public acceptance of harsh laws for illegal immigrants recently passed in Arizona and gaining traction elsewhere. Congress's failure to act also opened the Democratic leadership and the Obama administration to criticism from Latinos within the party. \"There are no policies coming out of Washington as it relates to immigration,\" Los Angeles Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa, the first Hispanic to hold that office in his city, said in a meeting with NPR Tuesday in Washington. \"Washington has just completely abdicated its responsibility.\" A Threat To Their Dream? The ad, which began airing earlier this week and will be heard on radio stations through this weekend, portrays Republicans as a threat to Latinos'\u00a0 goal of achieving the American dream. \"What would you do if a group of politicians were denying your hopes, your dreams?\" the ad\u2019s narrator begins. While many Latino groups have expressed frustration with the Obama administration's inability to advance an overhaul of immigration laws, the ad makes a clear effort to insulate the president: \"President Obama, the armed forces, chambers of commerce, universities and a majority of the public are on our side.\" The radio spot is playing in nine cities across Arizona, Colorado, Florida, Illinois, Nevada and Texas. The markets were selected because they have significant Latino populations that could factor heavily in those state\u2019s close elections. Latinos could have the greatest impact in California, where they now make up roughly 20 percent of registered voters. Their rapidly growing turnout, which leapt 85 percent from 2000 to 2008, has helped nudge the state back toward the political left. Brown, Whitman And The Latino Vote They already are figuring heavily in the pitched battle for California governor between Democratic nominee Jerry Brown and Republican nominee Meg Whitman. Most polling puts the race at a statistical tie or shows Brown, the state's attorney general and former governor, holding a narrow lead against Whitman, the former eBay chief executive and first-time candidate. This week Whitman, who has vowed to crack down on businesses employing undocumented workers, has been hit with accusations that she knowingly employed an illegal immigrant as her housekeeper. Whitman has denied the claim, as well as allegations made by the former housekeeper that Whitman \"exploited ... and emotionally and financially abused\" her. Latinos favored Brown by 19 points in a Los Angeles Times/University of Southern California poll released Monday. Since nonwhites were evenly split between the two candidates, Brown's 5 percentage point advantage in the overall survey was owed to Latino supporters. The SEUI plans to begin airing another Spanish-language ad in the Los Angeles and Fresno markets on Saturday that attacks Whitman over the housekeeper flap: \"Whitman attacks undocumented workers to win votes, but an undocumented woman worked in her home for nine years,\" the narrator says. \"Whitman says one thing in Spanish and something different in English. ... The real Meg Whitman has no shame. She's a two-faced woman.\" Whitman denounced the ad at a press conference Thursday. \"I have been to Spanish communities ... Latino communities throughout this state and I have worked very hard to win the vote of Latinos,\" she said. The Brown campaign and organized labor \"are nervous about it,\" Whitman added. \"Their campaign is in trouble. They are worried. They took Latinos for granted.\" Indeed, Latinos don't appear deeply enthusiastic about Brown, according to the research group Latino Decisions, which conducted the oversampling of Latino voters for the survey. The survey shows Brown with the support of 54 percent of Latino voters, compared with the 66 percent who favored California's Democratic Sen. Barbara Boxer, who is in the midst of a tough re-election campaign. The Whitman campaign sees a chance to carve away some Latino support. Of the $38 million she has spent on TV advertising, Whitman has put $4.5 million into Hispanic media, according to Evan Tracey, president of CMAG, an Arlington, Va., firm that tracks political advertising on television. By comparison, Tracey says, Brown has made no ad buys with Latino media. That's where the SEIU has stepped in, announcing this week a $5 million effort to mobilize Latino voters for Brown.",

What Changed for Latinos in 2010Today, we begin our series of conversations that look back at 2010. We're asking people from a variety of backgrounds: what's changed in the past year?\u00a0 We saw a dramatic and contentious election year, coupled with the ups and downs of Wall Street--while census numbers revealed that America is becoming more diverse by race and Hispanic origin.\u00a0 For Latinos in the US, 2010 was a challenge: high school drop out rates did not improve, the economic crisis affected them deeply, and the Senate vote on the Dream Act stumped hopes of immigration reform for undocumented young people. Today, host Neal Conan talks to national syndicated columnist with The Washington Post Writer's Group, Esther J. Cepeda, about what's changed in the past year for Latinos in the US. Behavior Profiling and the TSAMost airline passengers at airports expect to go through a body scan or pat-down, but they may also be\u00a0screened\u00a0based on their actions. Roughly 3,000 security officers trained under the Screening Passengers by Observation Technique (SPOT) program, identify people who may pose a threat to airline passengers based on body movement. Many say that human interactions with passengers, rather than technology, will help the TSA find the potential threats. But opponents argue that behavior profiling violates civil liberties. Neal Conan talks with Carl Maccario of the TSA, Ambassador Thomas McNamara, and Mike German of the ACLU about behavior profiling, and whether it is effective for airport security. How to Say: \"You're Not Invited\"While we love and tolerate our next-of-kin and extended family, there are those whose presence makes congregating around the tree awkward. Some of us say little or nothing at all, while others just avoid the problem invitee. So what IS the appropriate way to interact with these guests? Today, we check in with Amy Dickinson who writes the syndicated \"Ask Amy\" column for The Chicago Tribune about how to handle awkward holiday party guests.

Thursday's Senate setback of a measure to give grown children of illegal immigrants a path to citizenship has supporters considering their next move -- and wondering about the political implications of the action. The DREAM Act stalled and very likely died Thursday in the Senate, after Majority Leader Harry Reid was unable to persuade enough Republicans to give the measure the 60 votes it needed to avoid a GOP filibuster. The measure, which passed the House Wednesday by a 216-198 vote, would create the citizenship path through college or military service. Reid, a Nevada Democrat who won a tough re-election in November, promised his constituents that he'd bring the measure to the Senate floor. Reid's request that the Senate table the motion passed 59-40. Given the lack of Republican support and the dwindling number of days left in Congress's lame-duck session, the chances that the act will be reconsidered are slim. It is the latest setback in Congress' halting, highly politicized efforts to resolve issues related to illegal immigration -- either piecemeal or with comprehensive national immigration legislation. Those efforts were once bipartisan: Republican Sen. Orrin Hatch of Utah was an original sponsor of the DREAM Act and now opposes it, along with his fellow Utah Republican, Sen. Bob Bennett, who also once endorsed the measure. Hatch, who once questioned why children of illegal immigrants should be punished \"if they've lived good lives, if they've done good things,\" has said he now prefers that immigration policy focus on securing borders. NPR asked two leading Latino scholars and organizers to weigh in on the implications of the failure of the DREAM Act to clear Congress. Arturo Vargas is the executive director of the National Association of Latino Elected and Appointed Officials. Rodolfo O. de la Garza is a Columbia University professor of administrative law and municipal science with a specialty in ethnic politics, including Latino public opinion and electoral involvement, and immigration. Voting against the DREAM Act will solidify the long-standing pattern of Latino support for Democrats, which in the long run may do serious damage to the Republican Party. Rodolfo O. de la Garza, professor at Columbia University Q: What are the political implications for Republicans who oppose the DREAM Act? Vargas: Immigration reform and the DREAM Act were two of the top issues for many of the Latinos who voted in November's elections. Latino voters have demonstrated that they are following the actions of Congress closely and are paying attention. The lack of support among Republicans for passage of the DREAM Act could undermine efforts to reach out to this growing and increasingly decisive electorate. De la Garza: Individually, the great majority have little at risk because their constituencies include few Latinos. If this leads to a Democratic resurgence, then they will have contributed to returning the Republican Party to minority status. Republicans have long been divided, with those dependent on low-cost labor supporting immigration even if it is unauthorized, and cultural conservatives and nativists who have long opposed nonwhite immigration.\u00a0 What must be emphasized is that Latinos are not a significant part of the Republican constituency. Voting against the DREAM Act will solidify the long-standing pattern of Latino support for Democrats, which in the long run may do serious damage to the Republican Party. Q: If the effort fails, how much of the blame will Latino voters assign to Democrats and President Obama, especially going into the 2012 presidential campaign? Vargas: Latinos certainly remember the president's promises to make comprehensive immigration reform a priority, and the lack of success is a significant complication for him. However, his visible and public push for the DREAM Act since the November elections is also being noticed by Latinos. De la Garza: Obama is protected from feedback because of his strong support and the support of the Democratic House and the Senate, especially in the person of Harry Reid. Q: Would this, as opponents say, act as a magnet for more people to enter the United States illegally so that their children could get an education? Vargas: Of course not. It would not apply to future undocumented immigrant children. What Congress needs to do is address the broken immigration system so that we do not further exacerbate the problems with our immigration system and not create such populations in the future. Q: What happens now, with the House having passed the act but the Senate very unlikely to follow suit? Is the DREAM Act dead for next two years? Vargas: It is my hope that the new leadership in the House will recognize its duty to fix our broken immigration system and demonstrate the courage necessary to address it. The DREAM Act is a component of comprehensive immigration reform. Q: What does action on this bill suggest for the future of comprehensive immigration reform? Vargas: Until Congress and the White House address the broken immigration system, the issue will never go away. De la Garza: Nothing other than increased militarization and roundups is likely to be legislated.",

            "article_content": "California Republican governor candidate Meg Whitman pointed the finger of blame at Democratic rival Jerry Brown's campaign for the revelation that she had employed an undocumented housekeeper for nine years.\n                \n                    \n                    Kevork Djansezian/AP Photo\n                    \n                \nhide caption Meg Whitman, the Republican nominee for California governor, had someone precisely in mind to blame for the revelation that she and her husband had for nine years employed a housekeeper who turned out to be an undocumented immigrant. At a Thursday news conference, Whitman indicated she didn't totally blame the housekeeper who passed herself off as legal. The housekeeper, Nicky Diaz Santillan was being \"manipulated,\" Whitman said. Nor did she blame the employment agency through which she hired Santillan for not discovering the woman's immigration and work documents were fake. She blamed the gubernatorial campaign of California Attorney General Jerry Brown and lawyer Gloria Allred for a \"smear\" Whitman said. Actually, it was no little smear, she said. Rather, \"the Brown campaign and Gloria Allred are doing a masive smear campaign on my family and me,\" she said. At a news conference lasting more than an hour during which the former eBay CEO came across as supremely self-assured, she said she always acted within the law. And if there were victims, it was her and Santillan, two people trapped by unfortunate circumstance. The major points of Whitman's side of the story are that she first learned that Santillan was illegal on a Saturday in June 2009 when the housekeeper came to her and told her so. Whitman said she and her husband were shocked by the news since on her hiring, Santillan had shown the Whitmans an immigration form called an I-9, a California drivers license and a Social Security card. While the drivers license appears to have been authentic, the other documents were apparently not, Whitman said. Whitman further said she told the housekeeper she would consult her lawyer to see if there was anything that could be done.\u00a0The lawyer said there wasn't and Whitman said she reluctantly let Santillan go. Whitman repeated what she said in a statement the day before, that it was a sad moment when she fired Santillan since the housekeeper had been like a member of the family. She also said she and her husband \"Grif\" had a contract with the housekeeper to pay her $23 an hour for 15 hours. Whitman denied that she knew anything about Santillan's status any earlier than last year. She said she never saw a 2003 letter the Social Security letter issued to report that Santillan's Social Security number didn't match her name in its records. The Republican nominee said it was possible that Santillan intercepted such a letter if one was sent to the Whitman house because one of the housekeeper's duties was to get the mail from the mailbox and bring it into the Whitman house for sorting. The billionaire\u00a0denied she owed Santillan any money. She also denied that at the time of the firing she ever told Santillan anything along the lines of \"You don't know me and I don't know you, understand?\" Furthermore, she denied the charge some have made that the firing was politically expedient since, as she said, it would have made more sense to let the housekeeper go before February 2009 when she announced her campaign if she had done it for political reasons. Whitman said she didn't report Santillan to immigration authorities on learning of her undocumented status because she wasn't legally obliged to as the employer of a domestic worker. She also said she didn't want to\u00a0\"make an example,\" of Santillan. She also said if she had to do it all over again, she would do nothing differently. Reacting to Santillan's Wednesday news conference in which the ex-Whitman housekeeper had lawyer Gloria Allred by her side, Whitman said: \"The tragedy of this is Nicky is being manipulated... It's absolutely false. She was reading from a prepared statement, crying. She knows it's not true. And it's not.\" She also said: \"Gloria Allred does this before every election.\" Indeed, before Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger, a Republican, was first elected to that office, Allred had a press conference with a woman who claimed the former Hollywood movie star had groped her.",

Federal officials dropped opposition to a Georgia law requiring that voters prove they are U.S. citizens.\n                \n                    \n                    Stephen Morton/Getty Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption An election supervisor hands out absentee ballots during early voting in Savannah, Ga., in 2008. Federal officials dropped opposition to a Georgia law requiring that voters prove they are U.S. citizens. The Justice Department recently approved Georgia's voter verification law, which requires voters to prove they are U.S. citizens. Federal officials had blocked the law since 2008 but accepted the policy last month. The department, along with many civil rights groups, had opposed the 2008 Georgia law, saying it disproportionally affected the elderly, the poor and minorities. So it was a surprise when federal officials dropped their opposition. \"What Georgia has done is essentially created a new barrier where none existed before,\" says Kristen Clarke with the NAACP Legal Defense Fund. Georgia's Law Thousands of Georgians who tried to register to vote in the past two years were flagged by the system as problematic. In Georgia, voter records are checked with driver's license and Social Security data to make sure they match. But Clarke says the system prevents many legal voters from casting ballots. The last thing an undocumented immigrant would do is register to vote and be subject to further scrutiny. Jerry Gonzalez with the Georgia Association of Latino Elected Officials \"The analysis shows that this database-matching process is incredibly error-laden and unreliable. And because of those mistakes, many eligible voters are finding themselves locked out of the political process,\" Clarke says. Unlike those in most other states, Georgia's system also requires first-time voter registration applicants to prove they are U.S. citizens. State officials have argued they need to protect the voter rolls. But Jerry Gonzalez with the Georgia Association of Latino Elected Officials says illegal immigrants are not trying to vote. \"That's the most asinine assumption that people have been making whatsoever,\" he says. \"The last thing an undocumented immigrant would do is register to vote and be subject to further scrutiny. It just doesn't make any sense and it's a really ridiculous claim.\" Under the Voting Rights Act, states including Georgia that have a history of discrimination are required by federal law to get any changes pre-cleared by the federal government or the courts. The Justice Department would not comment on its decision to approve Georgia's policy. But Brian Kemp, Georgia's secretary of state, says the verification system is warranted. \"I don't think we're asking anything that's unreasonable. I think if it was, the Justice Department wouldn't have gone ahead and approved it,\" he says. Kemp says politics in the both the Bush and Obama Justice Departments caused the delay in getting approval, and he says once the state narrowed its requirements and filed its own lawsuit, federal officials finally agreed. \"Our victory was that we are doing exactly what we want to do. [We are] making sure we are verifying who somebody is and that they are a citizen before we register them to vote and making our voter rolls in Georgia just as secure as we can possibly make them,\" Kemp says. I don't think we're asking anything that's unreasonable. I think if it was, the Justice Department wouldn't have gone ahead and approved it. Georgia Secretary of State Brian Kemp 'As Often As Lightning Striking' Legal experts say only Georgia and Arizona have such restrictive laws. But Justin Levitt, a professor at Loyola Law School in California, says there are problems. Databases often contain simple errors. For example, if a person is listed as William in one record and Bill in another, his registration would be flagged. But Levitt says instances of real voter fraud are rare. \"It happens, but it's not frequent at all. In fact, it happens about as often as lightning striking,\" he says. Levitt says fines of up to $10,000 and the possibility of going to jail or being deported prevent most voter fraud. But in several states, illegal immigration has become a key issue, and some suggest that's what's fueling efforts to pass voter registration laws. \"This is really driven by partisanship,\" says Toby Moore, an elections researcher at the Research Triangle Institute in North Carolina. \"I think a lot of states are going to look at this and see this as giving them legal and perhaps political cover to introduce similar laws.\" Moore says these laws affect a small number of people, but he says in more and more elections, those numbers can make a difference in the outcome.",

Lenny McAllister is a syndicated political commentator and the author of the book, Diary of a Mad Black PYC (Proud Young Conservative). He is featured regularly on outlets including CNN, Fox News and XM Radio. How can a former constitutional law professor, an attorney general and an iconic organization get it so wrong on civil rights? When you look at it, it is hard to tell if the White House, the Department of Justice and the NAACP are merely a collective sign of the times or the reasons why the times are sadly changing. Over the course of the past week, all three iconic institutions have corrupted the legacy of civil rights activism in America, using their efforts to support legal initiatives that pervert the legacy of black civil rights leaders with self-serving and misguided political efforts that, if successful, will corrupt the definitions of right and wrong in our nation. President Barack Obama's initial criticism of Arizona's SB 1070 illegal immigration law has grown from publicly speaking out against the bill himself to allowing Mexico's President Felipe Calder\u00f3n to rail against the bill from the floor of the U.S. Congress. Now President Obama's objection to the law has prompted a lawsuit from the Department of Justice against the Arizona statute. The lawsuit alleges that this state law supersedes federal law on illegal immigration (which, by the way, it does not -- it merely enforces federal law), and charges that the law will discriminate against Spanish-speaking people -- including the illegal immigrants that the law targets under conditions. Of late, rumors have been swirling of presidential amnesty for illegal immigrants; U.S. Sen. James Inhofe (R-Okla.) charged that the president is using the issue of border security as a ploy to win amnesty for undocumented workers currently residing in the United States. In the midst of all this, the Department of Justice lawsuit comes across to many political conservatives and moderates as a political maneuver to gain support for the Obama administration as it attempts to shape immigration reform in the partisan, self-serving fashion that health care and stimulus bills were passed so far. This effort has been supported by Obama supporters including Rev. Al Sharpton, activists who have promised to bring people to Arizona to protest ''... in the spirit of the Freedom Riders from the civil rights movement...'' This is notably troubling considering that the civil rights of non-citizens of the United States have remained a driving factor in the move to file this lawsuit, a move that says as much about the White House's political motives as it does about the incorrectly fluid definitions of ''civil rights'' and ''human rights'' within the administration and its supporters on the left. The political zeal for this lawsuit against Arizona contrasts suspiciously with the lack of Justice Department action against the New Black Panther Party over voter intimidation tactics used during the 2008 presidential election. These acts of intimidation at the polls were documented repeatedly on film, activity committed by individuals that had no shame in being recorded while spewing their hatred for white Americans. Yet, Attorney General Eric Holder's department has repeatedly refused to file charges against principal actors from the 2008 events, despite continued complaints for some sort of action in the spirit and defense of civil rights for all Americans, particularly those in the process of practicing their civil right to vote. The department's silence in this instance rings of hollow political expedience and whimsical pre-conditions of what constitutes civil rights violations in today's America - criteria defined by the powers that be, not the power for equality entailed in the Constitution. When the Department of Justice is capable of determining that the rights of non-citizens must be championed as it condones American citizens being intimidated and threatened while enacting their right to vote, we are approaching a point in America where justice is too subjective to be counted on to provide stability and equality for our citizens on a regular basis. Whereas the Obama administration can blame political allegiances on their willingness to blur the criteria needed to defend of civil rights, the California chapter of the NAACP is doing so out of activism laziness. Instead of taking on the growing issue of drug use and its destructive impact on black America, the NAACP has instead called the legalization of marijuana in the Golden State a ''civil rights issue'' due to the high rates of arrests of young black men around the possession and distribution of cannabis in a work-around of the problem of black youth criminalization. A once-proud organization that championed the rights of poor, black people that needed a pathway out of deplorable conditions to a standard of equality now facilitates justice through changing a law that, in essence, will lower the standard for folks it claims to advocate for. The civil rights issue with black criminalization around the drug trade is ultimately not centered on the amount of arrests made in the black community, as changing the definition of ''crime'' does not change the conditions of these men. Instead, the civil rights issue missed by the NAACP is centered on the conditions that make the drug life more appealing and available to young black men than education, family unity and career advancement--all items that the NAACP used to be more focused on than legalizing crime and community decay. All three instances exhibit a growing willingness of black leaders within America to leverage the legacy of successes of the civil rights movement and use the historical weight to guide the pursuit of American civil rights away from equality and justice and toward self-prescribed definitions of what is right and wrong based on pop politics and eroding social values. The power driving the civil rights movement of the 20th century was its incorruptible view of justice, a trait that allowed its leaders to appeal to the conscience of the world while leveraging the timelessness of the Constitution to forge past the injustices black people suffered. Today, the call to secure civil rights for people has been spread to political and social offshoots that would make our ancestors cringe should they witness the subjectivity of such contemporary matters--all while we miss grand opportunities before us to stand for civil rights and true justice even if the choices to do so are difficult as they were years ago. These current decisions to ''advocate for civil rights'' only works to corrode the moral authority that black America garnered over the course of history with the abolition movement, Reconstruction, the Jim Crow Era and the civil rights movement of the 20th century. We are in need of a new civil rights movement -- in politics, social activism and community redevelopment -- but not one that pursues civil rights in the modes recently displayed by the White House, the Department of Justice and California's NAACP.",

Some prominent conservatives are speaking out in favor of the kind of comprehensive immigration bill that many Republicans oppose -- one that would include border security and then a path to citizenship for undocumented immigrants. As a leading evangelical conservative, Richard Land's credentials are impeccable. He heads the public policy arm of the Southern Baptist Convention, and from that influential perch he's been urging his fellow conservatives to rethink their opposition to the immigration overhaul.  \"I've had some of them appeal to me. They say, 'Richard, you're going to divide the conservative coalition.' And I said, 'Well, I may divide the old conservative coalition, but I'm not going to divide the new one.' \" Land adds, \"If the new conservative coalition is going to be a governing coalition, it's going to have to have a significant number of Hispanics in it, that's dictated by demographics, and you don't get large numbers of Hispanics to support you when you're engaged in anti-Hispanic immigration rhetoric.\" Last week, when President Obama gave his speech on immigration, Land was in the audience. In fact, he had urged the president to make the speech. Obama called on both parties to rise above petty politics to fix the country's broken immigration system. Land says that will be very hard because, for both parties, there's a short-term political advantage to doing nothing. \"Democrats, because it scares Hispanics, who can vote, into voting for them, and they can convince them that the Republicans are anti-Hispanic. And Republicans, because they look at these polls that show that 70 percent of Americans support the Arizona law, and they say, 'You know, we can win with this in November.' And my argument is: Politicians think about the next election; statesmen think about the next generation.\" But even if Republicans are thinking only of the next election, or the next few elections, Land says, the lessons of history should compel them to think again. \"The people who have been anti-immigration have lost every one of these arguments,\" he says. \"They lost it with the Irish in the 1830s and '40s and turned them into Democrats for three generations. They lost it with the Italians in the 1890s and the early part of the 20th century and turned the Italians into Democrats for three generations. I mean, you know, do they want to do it with the Hispanics too?\" Arizona state Rep. Jonathan Paton (right), shown in a 2007 file photo, says if he's elected to Congress, \"I can't vote for anything that would give a path of citizenship for those who would come into the country illegally.\"\n                \n                    \n                    Ross D.

Jonathan Paton (right), shown in a 2007 file photo, says if he's elected to Congress, \"I can't vote for anything that would give a path of citizenship for those who would come into the country illegally.\"  Arizona state Sen. Jonathan Paton, one of the Republicans running for Congress in the 8th district, voted for the immigration law in the state legislature. He says he's more concerned with the survival of his state than the survival of the Republican party. As for the federal government, he says, \"We're not asking for more laws -- we're asking for them to enforce the laws they already have, and to take that seriously.\" He says people who are in the U.S. illegally \"absolutely\" should be arrested and deported. And if he's elected to the U.S. Congress, Paton says, he knows how he will vote on immigration: \"I can't vote for anything that would give a path of citizenship for those who would come into the country illegally.\"  Despite the arguments of conservatives like Richard Land or former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush, that is the bottom line for most Republicans in Congress, says Texas Sen. John Cornyn.  \"That's what causes so much heartburn on the right,\" Cornyn says. \"Because that is viewed as tantamount to amnesty, which is of course a radioactive term.\" Cornyn, who says 30 percent of his constituents are Hispanic, represents what could be called the middle of the internal Republican debate on immigration. He says he too is for comprehensive immigration legislation -- he just doesn't want it to include a pathway to citizenship. He's intrigued by the idea of other forms of legalization -- maybe a permanent green card for undocumented workers, who pay a fine or plead guilty to a misdemeanor.  \"It wouldn't satisfy the left because they want these folks to be on a path to citizenship,\" Cornyn says. \"They'd obviously like them to register to vote, and they'd like to gain the electoral advantage by adding them to their column. I think it would be one way to try to thread the needle.\" But before Cornyn gets a chance to test his theory about the motives of his Democratic opponents, he and other Republicans will have to resolve their own debate about immigration, and what they want to happen after the border is secured: deportation, legalization or citizenship. That's a debate that will take several years to resolve, and right now it's being obscured by the legal drama of the United States v. Arizona.",

            "article_content": "It's not even safe to go back in the water, at least along the Gulf Coast, but President Obama is wading in on another big issue: immigration. Speaking at American University in Washington, the president rejected a blanket amnesty for illegal immigrants, calling such a move \"unwise and unfair\" but he also rebutted the idea that it's possible to \"round up and deport\" undocumented workers. \"\u2026 it would tear at the very fabric of this nation, because immigrants who are here illegally are now intricately woven into that fabric,\" he said. In short, he said: \"the system is broken.

While the U.S. \"reaps incredible economic rewards because we remain a magnet to the best and brightest across from across the globe,\" Obama said, the process of immigration had nonetheless \"often been painful\". \"Each new wave of immigrants has generated fear and resentments toward newcomers, particularly in times of economic upheaval,\" he said. Obama also called for a reform of the legal immigration system, which he said is backlogged by bureaucracy: \"While an applicant waits for approval, he or she is often forbidden from visiting the United States, which means even husbands and wives may be forced to spend many years apart.\"",

            "article_content": "No surprise that President Barack Obama and President Felipe Calderon of Mexico used the opportunity of their joint White House appearance with the news media Wednesday to criticize Arizona's new anti-illegal immigration law. It was the first time the two leaders of the nations most affected by the new law had a chance to tag team Arizona. In their respective statements before taking questions, Obama said: OBAMA: We also discussed the new law in Arizona, which is a misdirected effort -- a misdirected expression of frustration over our broken immigration system, and which has raised concerns in both our countries. Today, I want every American to know my administration has devoted unprecedented resources in personnel and technology to securing our border. Illegal immigration is down, not up, and we will continue to do what's necessary to secure our shared border. And I want everyone, American and Mexican, to know my administration is taking a very close look at the Arizona law. We're examining any implications, especially for civil rights. Because in the United States of America, no law-abiding person -- be they an American citizen, a legal immigrant, or a visitor or tourist from Mexico -- should ever be subject to suspicion simply because of what they look like. Calderon said: In Mexico, we are and will continue being respectful of the internal policies of the United States and its legitimate right to establish in accordance to its Constitution whatever laws it approves. But we will retain our firm rejection to criminalize migration so that people that work and provide things to this nation will be treated as criminals. And we oppose firmly the S.B. 1070 Arizona law given in fair principles that are partial and discriminatory. Later, a question allowed Obama to once again detail some of his concerns with the law and to spell out his vision for comprehensive health reform, something he's done several times since Arizona passed its law. PRESIDENT OBAMA: I think the Arizona law has the potential of being applied in a discriminatory fashion. Now, after it was initially passed, the Arizona legislature amended it and said that this should not be carried out in a discriminatory way. But I think a fair reading of the language of the statute indicates that it gives the possibility of individuals who are deemed suspicious of being illegal immigrants from being harassed or arrested. And the judgments that are going to be made in applying this law are troublesome. What I've directed my Justice Department to do is to look very carefully at the language of this law to see whether it comports both with our core values and existing legal standards, as well as the fact that the federal government is ultimately the one charged with immigration policy. And I expect to get a final report back from the Justice Department soon, at which point we'll make some decisions in terms of how we are going to address that law. Now, what I've also said, though, is that the Arizona law, I think, expresses some of the frustrations that the American people have had in not fixing a broken immigration system and, frankly, the failures of the federal government to get this done. I'm sympathetic to those frustrations; I share those frustrations -- which is why, from the time that I was a U.S. senator through the time that I ran for President, until now, I have consistently said that I'm supportive of a comprehensive immigration reform approach. And I think the majority of American people are open to a comprehensive immigration reform approach, which would say the following things: Number one, that the federal government takes its responsibilities for securing our border seriously. And as I just stated in my opening remarks, we have actually put more resources, more personnel on the borders, and illegal immigration is actually down on the borders, not up. I know that's not the perception out there, but that's the fact. But we haven't done enough. So we've got a responsibility to create an orderly border, and that's something that we have to do not unilaterally, but also working with the Mexican government -- because there are enormous flows of trade and tourists and people along the border region; the economies are interdependent; and we've got to control the borders, but do so in a way that does not have an adverse impact on the economies of those regions. The second thing we've got to do is we've got to make sure that businesses are following the rules and are not actively recruiting undocumented workers so that they don't have to abide by overtime laws, they don't have to abide by minimum wage laws, they don't have to abide by worker safety laws and otherwise undercut basic worker protections that exist. And they have to be held accountable and responsible. The third thing we have to do is to make sure that those who have come to this country illegally are held accountable. And that means they need to pay a fine, they need to pay back taxes. I believe they should learn English. I believe that it is important for them to get to the back of the line and not in the front, but that we create a pathway so that they have an opportunity, if they are following the rules, following the law, to become legal residents and ultimately citizens of this country. Now, that kind of package in which everybody has responsibilities I think is one that can pass. And it is one that I am fully supportive of. And I've said this again and again. And I think if we get that done, then you will be less likely to see the kinds of measures that we saw in Arizona. The president continues to be one of the few Washington politicians openly calling for an immigration overhaul. The issue is radioactive, especially during a mid-term election year in which most respondents in an array of polls say they support the strict Arizona law. But the president has come under significant pressure from his Hispanic voters, who were energized by promises he made during the presidential campaign that he would support a comprehensive immigration overhaul, to make good on that promise. Some supporters have have questioned his commitment to the issue. So his recent comments, including Wednesday's, are meant to signal his steadfastness to immigration reform even if many other Democrats and virtually all Republicans don't want to touch the issue.",

            "article_content": "Senate Democrats rolled out their framework for  a comprehensive overhaul to immigration Thursday, saying the top priority is to secure the border. They also called for issuing biometric Social Security cards and carving a path for more than 10 million immigrants to become legal. The senators had barely finished fighting back a GOP filibuster blocking their financial regulatory overhaul when five of their leaders rolled out yet another proposal to revamp the nation's laws. With unemployment rampant and states' budgets in dire straits, it might not seem the best time to decide how to deal with illegal immigrants. But Dick Durbin, the Senate's No. 2 Democrat, said Arizona's move last week taking immigration enforcement into its own hands left Congress no choice but to act.  \"It's worth quoting what the Arizona association of the chiefs of police have said: 'We strongly urge the U.S. Congress to immediately initiate the necessary steps to begin the process of comprehensively addressing the immigration issue, to provide solutions that are fair, logical and equitable.' \"  In their proposal, Democrats acknowledge widespread concern about violence along the U.S.-Mexico border and the need to get things under control.  \"Our framework is fix the border first, but don't just fix the border,\" said Sen. Charles Schumer (D-NY), who succeeded the late Ted Kennedy as chairman of the subcommittee dealing with immigration laws. Schumer is now the leading advocate for a broad rewrite of those laws. The centerpiece of his proposal is to make sure all employees are in the U.S. legally -- and to do that, it calls for a biometric version of a familiar document.  \"Our framework creates a fraud-proof, high-tech version of the Social Security card every one of us has,\" Schumer said. \"New hires must show this card to their employers, who will swipe the cards through a machine to confirm their identity and immigration status.\"  Like Congress' last attempt at an immigration overhaul, this one draws a path to legal status for more than 10 million people in the country illegally. Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-CA) said undocumented workers would have to register with the government, pay back taxes, learn English and go to the back of the line for citizenship.  \"What we have in mind is not amnesty,\" Feinstein said. \"It's a tough and fair path forward for those who have contributed to American society.\"  But as with so many of their other initiatives, the Democrats have not convinced any Republicans to co-sponsor the measure. \"How can you reasonably answer people around the country who are saying fix the system, and then they won't let us fix the system?\" asked Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid. \"We're saying to our Republican colleagues, and I think you've noted the tone here today, we are inviting them to work with us.\"  New Hampshire's Judd Gregg is one of a half-dozen Republicans whom Democrats have been trying to win over. \"There's no point in bringing up any legislation,\" Gregg said, \"until this administration starts acting responsibly on the border and does its job, which is to secure the border. That's the obligation of the president and the executive branch, and they aren't doing it.\"  Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-SC) had earlier co-sponsored Schumer's immigration measure but withdrew that support, alleging that Democrats are rushing the issue.  \"I think immigration brought up for partisan political purposes is just bad for the issue. I'm not going to be part of that, I'm not playing that game,\" Graham said.  House Minority Leader John Boehner declared on Thursday that there is no chance that immigration will move through Congress.  \"It's nothing more than a cynical ploy to try to engage voters, some segment of voters, to show up in this November's elections,\" Boehner said.  Many Republicans suspect Majority Leader Reid is mainly seeking to win over Latinos, which account for 1 in 4 of his constituents in Nevada, where he faces a tough re-election. Reid says he's committed to bringing an immigration bill to the Senate floor, but in a nod to the tough odds it faces, he said it would be unwise to set an arbitrary deadline for doing so.",

            "article_content": "Has Arizona given immigration overhaul a new life?\n                hide caption When the Republicans were in power, they had their chance to do something about immigration.\u00a0 They tried but failed. The GOP was split in two.\u00a0 One wing -- led by President Bush, Arizona Sen. John McCain and the U.S. Chamber of Commerce -- worked to liberalize the laws that would eventually lead to legalization of the 11 million or so undocumented immigrants already in the U.S.\u00a0 But many GOP members of Congress insisted the real problem, and the first needing fixing, was the porous border with Mexico.\u00a0 Anything short of that was amnesty.\u00a0 (The button used for illustration at the top of this post is from a right-wing group.) Bush did not give the issue simple lip service; it was something close to his heart.\u00a0 He was elected and re-elected governor of Texas by reaching out to Hispanics -- a strategy at complete odds with what California Republicans did with the anti-immigration Proposition 187 in 1994.\u00a0 That initiative helped Gov. Pete Wilson (R) win re-election ... but at a cost: the party had said adios to Latino voters.\u00a0 Bush was determined to reverse that trend. Yes, border security is important, and employers need to be accountable with whom they hire.\u00a0 But Bush, in speaking to the Chamber of Commerce in 2006, said it was more than that: Some members of Congress argue that no one who came to this country  illegally should be allowed to continue living and working in our country, and  that any plan that allows them to stay equals amnesty, no matter how many  conditions we impose. I appreciate the members are acting on deeply felt principles. I understand  that. Yet I also believe that the approach they suggest is wrong and  unrealistic.\u00a0 There is a rational middle ground between granting  an automatic path to citizenship for every illegal immigrant, and a program that  requires every illegal immigrant to leave. But then came the 2006 elections, in which Republicans lost their majority in both houses of Congress.\u00a0 While immigration was hardly what made Nancy Pelosi speaker that year, it still seemed to backfire on those Republicans who tried to make it a wedge issue. And then, after 2008 and the election of Barack Obama, it was the Democrats' turn to do something about the situation.\u00a0 And they too had their internal divisions.\u00a0 Despite Obama's pledge that immigration was a top priority, there were a lot of other priorities fighting for Congress' attention as well.\u00a0 Like health care.\u00a0 Financial deregulation.\u00a0 Climate control.\u00a0 And a new Supreme Court opening. Plus, with nearly 10 percent unemployment, many Democrats were skittish to take on an issue that could be transformed -- or demagogued -- into one where \"they\" would be taking \"our\" jobs.\u00a0 Yes, Sens. Charles Schumer (D-NY) and Lindsey Graham (R-SC) were trying to work on a bipartisan plan.\u00a0 But Democrats for the most part were not confident; as Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse (D-RI) said, \"Republicans have all run so hard right in the campaign season that it's hard to believe that we're capable of doing anything like that [overhaul] until the frenzy has calmed.\" Translation:\u00a0 Democrats didn't have the votes either. And then came Arizona. One week ago today, the Arizona state Senate passed what has widely been described as the most sweeping, stringent anti-immigration laws in the country.\u00a0 It would allow authorities to demand proof of legal status from anyone suspected of being in the U.S. illegally, and if that were proved to be the case, they would be deported. The measure was the pet cause of GOP lawmaker Russell Pearce, who for years was best known for his promotion of ways to keep illegal immigrants out of the country ... at least out of Arizona.\u00a0 A recent New York Times profile of Pearce, by Randal Archibold, noted that \"not long ago\" he was \"seen by many as an eccentric firebrand,\" a \"politically incorrect embarrassment by more moderate members of his party -- often to the delight of his supporters.\"\u00a0 According to that Times profile, in 2007 Pearce appeared in a photograph with a man who was a featured speaker at a neo-Nazi conference (Pearce says he was unaware of the man's connection with teh group) and in 2006 he spoke admirably of a 1950s program called Operation Wetback, \"and for sending an e-mail message to supporters that included an attachment \u2014  inadvertently, he said \u2014 from a white supremacist group.\" But things once thought to be out of the mainstream are no longer.\u00a0 The profile continued to say that Pearce \"cannot be dismissed as just the party\u2019s right-wing fringe.  As chairman of the Senate\u2019s appropriation committee, he controls whose bills are  financed, and he has shown an uncanny knack to capitalize on this border state\u2019s  immigration anxiety.\" Sen. McCain, who faces a tough primary challenge in August from ex-Rep. J.D. Hayworth -- he says McCain is soft on immigration -- endorsed the bill, calling it a \"good tool.\"\u00a0 (A N.Y.  Times editorial on April 22 ripped McCain for his \"pandering.\") Every Arizona Republican House member and all but one state senator voted for it; the one senator who voted no is leaving office because of term limits.\u00a0 The votes even came from moderates like state Rep. Bill Konopnicki, who conceded, \"Everybody was afraid to vote no on immigration.\" Gov. Jan Brewer, a Republican who ascended to the office last year when Janet Napolitano (D) joined the Obama Cabinet, signed the bill on Friday.\u00a0 She too is facing primary challengers from the right. (Napolitano had previously vetoed similar legislation.) Even before Brewer signed the measure, Obama strongly criticized it as \"misguided,\" saying it threatened to \"undermine basic notions of fairness that we cherish as Americans, as well as the trust between police and our communities that is so crucial to keeping us safe.\" Whatever you think of what happened in Arizona -- a state probably more affected by illegal immigration than any other, a state that has seen a rise in crimes coming from across the border with Mexico -- if nothing else it points to the fact that Washington has not acted. But now it might. Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid is now suggesting that it could come up right after the Memorial Day break.\u00a0 And now some of the same Democrats who were afraid to touch the third rail of immigration now suddenly see it as a winning issue.\u00a0 The Washington Post's Kornblut & Hsu write: Some Democrats have calculated that even if an immigration bill fails, a  debate on it could rally their base and mobilize Hispanic voters against GOP lawmakers in some districts. And while it could also energize  Republican voters, some Democrats said the Arizona bill has also provided them  with the opportunity to put Republicans on the defensive nationally. But if what we're talking about is just politics and political advantage -- and not fixing the problems -- then nothing changes. Meanwhile, there will be legal challenges to the new Arizona law, which is scheduled to take effect 90 days after the legislative session ends -- probably by August.\u00a0 Brewer herself has been careful to say that racial profiling, which opponents of the law fear is likely to happen, would not be tolerated.\u00a0 Still, she added, \"We in Arizona have been more than patient waiting for Washington to act.\u00a0 But decades of inaction and misguided policy have created a dangerous and unacceptable situation.\" Flashback:\u00a0 Here's the ad Pete Wilson used regarding his efforts against illegal immigration that helped him win re-election in California in 1994.",

Jan Brewer Friday, April 23, 2010, in Phoenix. Arizona Gov. Jan Brewer signed into law Friday a tough immigration bill that President Obama criticized as \"misguided.\" The sweeping measure, sent to the Republican governor by the GOP-led Legislature, would make it a crime under state law to be in the country illegally. It would also require local police officers to question people about their immigration status if there is reason to suspect they are illegal immigrants. Brewer said the law \"protects every Arizona citizen.\" \"We in Arizona have been more than patient waiting for Washington to act,\" she said after signing the law. \"But decades of inaction and misguided policy have created a dangerous and unacceptable situation.\" The bill takes effect in 90 days after the current legislative session ends. Earlier, while renewing his call for a \"comprehensive\" overhaul of the nation's immigration laws, Obama criticized the  Arizona measure, calling it \"misguided.\" He directed the Justice Department to be on the lookout for possible civil rights violations. He said similar reactions were likely elsewhere until the federal government moved forward with both border security and a path to legalization for millions of undocumented residents. \"Indeed, our failure to act responsibly at the federal level will only open the door to irresponsibility by others,\" Obama said. The president made the comments during a Rose Garden ceremony for two dozen new Americans, whose citizenship was fast-tracked by their military service. Civil rights activists have said the Arizona bill would lead to racial profiling and deter Hispanics from reporting crimes. Hundreds of Hispanics protested the legislation at the state capitol complex on Thursday. The bill's sponsor, Republican Sen. Russell Pearce of Mesa, said it would remove \"political handcuffs\" from police and help drive illegal immigrants from the state. \"Illegal is illegal,\" said Pearce, a driving force on the issue in Arizona. \"We'll have less crime. We'll have lower taxes. We'll have safer neighborhoods. We'll have shorter lines in the emergency rooms. We'll have smaller classrooms.\" Arizona has an estimated 460,000 illegal immigrants and is the nation's busiest border crossing point, with the harsh, remote desert serving as the illegal gateway for thousands of Mexicans and Central Americans. Other provisions of the bill allow lawsuits against government agencies that hinder enforcement of immigration laws, and make it illegal to hire illegal immigrants for day labor or knowingly transport them. The bill would take effect 90 days after the current legislative session ends if it becomes law. Brewer faces a contested Aug. 24 Republican primary election, and one of her opponents, state Treasurer Dean Martin, has called on her to sign the legislation. Also, the March 27 shooting death of rancher Bob Krentz on his property in southeastern Arizona has brought illegal immigration and border security into greater focus in the state. Authorities believe Krentz was killed by an illegal border crosser. Since the shooting, Brewer and other officeholders and candidates have toured the state's border with Mexico. On Thursday, she ordered a reallocation of state National Guard and law enforcement resources and called on the federal government to deploy National Guard troops. Arizona has previously passed a variety of get-tough measures dealing with illegal immigration. Brewer's predecessor, Janet Napolitano, a Democrat who is now Obama's homeland security secretary, vetoed similar proposals. But she signed a 2007 law that imposes sanctions against employers who knowingly hire illegal immigrants. Other state laws make human smuggling a state crime and restrict illegal immigrants' eligibility for public services. The Mexican-American Legal Defense and Education Fund said the bill before Brewer is unconstitutional because regulation of immigration is a federal responsibility. Others urging Brewer to veto the bill include Catholic bishops, New Mexico Gov. Bill Richardson, a Democrat, and Arizona Attorney General Terry Goddard, the Democratic Party's presumptive nominee for governor. Mexico's embassy also has voiced concerns about racial profiling. A Phoenix Law Enforcement Association representative acknowledged that racial profiling can occur but said fears associated with the bill are unfounded. \"We're not targeting any particular group,\" said Levi Bolton, a retired police detective. \"Cops are not here to do these things to you.\" NPR's Scott Horsley contributed to this report, which also includes material from The Associated Press",

Jose Serrano (D-NY),  Luis Gutierrez (D-IL), Nydia Velazquez (D-NY) and Pedro Pierluisi (D-PR) announce their support for the health care reform bill on Thursday. As the clock ticks down to Sunday's make-or-break vote on health care in the House, Democratic leaders continue to hunt for the 216 votes needed for passage.  Their job has been made easier by the decision of all 23 Democrats in the Congressional Hispanic Caucus to back the legislation. The support of some of those lawmakers had been in doubt, but a promise from President Obama on overhauling the nation's immigration laws trumped their misgivings on the health care bill. A Change Of Heart Rep. Luis Gutierrez (D-IL) had a problem with the health care bill before the House.  He found it deeply unfair that the bill expressly forbids illegal immigrants to buy health insurance on new exchanges that would be set up.  And that can't be fixed by a separate package of amendments the House will vote on, because everything in it has to be budget-related. \"I have said on numerous occasions I cannot vote for the bill in its current form, under the current format,\" Gutierrez said two days ago.  But Gutierrez did not want the health care bill to fail.  What he wanted, as chairman of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus's Immigration Task Force, was for President Obama to honor campaign promises to push for an immigration overhaul. At a news conference Thursday, Gutierrez said he got what he wanted. \"After extensive discussions with the president, I believe we have a health care bill I can vote 'yes' for, and I believe we have a commitment from the president to move forward on a comprehensive immigration reform package quickly,\" he said. Following Through At that same hour, the White House issued a statement from President Obama. He pledged to do everything in his power to forge a bipartisan consensus this year to move forward on comprehensive immigration reform \u2014 everything from enforcing border and workplace laws to dealing with millions of undocumented immigrants. That followed a meeting the president had with two senators pushing for such legislation, Charles Schumer (D-NY) and Lindsey Graham (R-SC).  They gave the president what they called a framework for an immigration overhaul, leaving the ball in the court of the White House to write such a bill. The renewed effort to move immigration legislation comes as thousands of pro-immigrant activists plan to march on the Capitol this Sunday as the final showdown on health care begins in the House.  Friday outside the Capitol, Latino activists praised that legislation. \"I think many of us saw the writing on the wall in that we weren't going to get the legislative fixes this time around that we hoped to,\" says Claudine Karasik of the Mexican American Legal Defense and Educational Fund. She adds that she's expecting that the flaws in the health care legislation will be fixed with comprehensive immigration reform, but she wants commitments from lawmakers. Expert: Overhaul Of Immigration Unlikely For This Congress But with midterm elections looming this fall, congressional expert Jack Pitney of Claremont McKenna College in California says it's a tall order for an immigration makeover to happen before then. \"At the moment I'd say it'd be a bit of a surprise if Congress acted on it, but then again, a lot of people didn't think health care reform would come to a final vote in the House either,\" he says. Pitney says revamping immigration laws could certainly win Democrats more votes from Latinos. Some, however, could get punished at the polls for supporting what many opponents expect will amount to an amnesty for the undocumented millions.",

Russell Pearce defends Arizona's reputation as one of the most unwelcoming spots for undocumented workers in the U.S. He says those headed to the nation's capital are promoting anarchy. \"These folks who march with no respect for the law, have no regard for the victims of crime and the damage and cost to America,\" Pearce said. \"Shame on them. Shame on them! They're as treasonous and as un-American as anyone I know.\" For their part, many marchers say they're just trying to reach consensus on this inflammatory issue. Some who can't make the trip East are trying to reach out in other ways. Jeff Zetino has been working a phone bank to drum up support for a weekend rally in Phoenix to tell state and federal lawmakers that their constituents are ready for change. \"The winds of Washington, they flip on a dime,\" Zetino told Peter O'Dowd of KJZZ. \"I'm not a tea-leaf reader, I'm not a truth sayer. I'm just here doing my work making sure that my efforts are felt.\" In meetings last week, Obama sought to assure activists and senators who are drafting a bill of his \"unwavering\" commitment to comprehensive immigration changes. But that same day, the White House also signaled that the issue is not on its priority list for action before the entire House and one-third of the Senate face voters in November. Asked about the priorities after health care, White House press secretary Robert Gibbs said financial regulation, energy legislation and watering down a recent Supreme Court ruling on campaign finance are among the \"big priorities\" \u2014 not to mention jobs and the economy. Gibbs said nothing would happen on immigration without strong bipartisan support. \"It's got to be more than the president wants to get something done,\" he said. How to handle the millions of people in the U.S. illegally is a volatile issue, with some interests opposing any attempt to help them become citizens and others insisting on stronger border controls first. Lawmakers failed to agree in 2006 and 2007 when they last tried to overhaul the immigration system, and the political climate this year is tougher than it was back then. Advocates remain hopeful and say Congress has plenty of time to send Obama a bill by November. Sens. Chuck Schumer (D-NY) and Lindsey Graham (R-SC) released an outline of their bill Thursday, and Obama pledged to get immigration legislation moving through Congress this year. The outline calls for illegal immigrants who want to get on the path to legal status to admit they broke the law by entering the U.S., pay fines and back taxes and perform community service. They also would be required to pass background checks and be proficient in English before working toward legal residency, required before becoming a citizen. Obama tapped Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano to oversee the effort, and she has sought support for immigration overhaul in dozens of meetings with lawmakers from both parties. Her department also has taken steps to improve the current system by focusing deportations of undocumented immigrants on those with criminal histories and by going after employers who knowingly hire undocumented immigrants, rather than the workers themselves. But those steps haven't eased the anger and disappointment felt by immigration reform advocates and Latinos, who voted heavily for Obama in the 2008 presidential election largely because of his promise. Obama's position is that the system needs to be fixed to better track who goes in and out of the U.S., crack down on employers that hire undocumented immigrants and help those people come out of the shadows and contribute to society, including paying taxes. He wants them to register, pay a fine, learn English and not skip ahead of anyone already in the citizenship pipeline. \"It will be one of my priorities on my first day [as president] because this is an issue that we have demagogued,\" candidate Obama told the National Association of Latino Elected Officials in June 2008. \"There's been a lot of politics around it, but we haven't been serious about solving the problem. And I want to solve the problem.\" \"I will make it a top priority in my first year as president,\" he told the League of United Latin American Citizens the following month. Five months after taking office, Obama said after meeting at the White House in June 2009 with a bipartisan group of about 30 lawmakers that immigration overhaul would be a difficult undertaking. But he said work on it must get under way that year. By August 2009, the rhetoric had changed. Asked about immigration overhaul at a news conference during a visit to Mexico, Obama said changing the system would have to wait until 2010 while he focused on other priorities, such as overhauling the health care and financial regulatory systems. In appearances after that, Obama promised action but dropped references to any timetable.",

            "article_content": "Media outlets are posting and reporting on a letter found at a website registered to a Joseph Stack. That is the same name, Joseph Andrew Stack, as the person who, according to federal officials, owned the Piper plane that crashed into an office building in Austin, Texas and a house that was reportedly set on fire. The rambling letter, a diatribe against the government and the Internal Revenue Service, appears to be a suicide note. Because the office building that was struck contained many IRS offices and nearly 200 agency employees, the letter, assuming it is what it appears to be, could help explain why the building was targeted. The letter is below. ------------------------------------------If you're reading this, you're no doubt asking yourself, \"Why did this have to happen?\" The simple truth is that it is complicated and has been coming for a long time. The writing process, started many months ago, was intended to be therapy in the face of the looming realization that there isn't enough therapy in the world that can fix what is really broken. Needless to say, this rant could fill volumes with example after example if I would let it. I find the process of writing it frustrating, tedious, and probably pointless... especially given my gross inability to gracefully articulate my thoughts in light of the storm raging in my head. Exactly what is therapeutic about that I'm not sure, but desperate times call for desperate measures. We are all taught as children that without laws there would be no society, only anarchy. Sadly, starting at early ages we in this country have been brainwashed to believe that, in return for our dedication and service, our government stands for justice for all. We are further brainwashed to believe that there is freedom in this place, and that we should be ready to lay our lives down for the noble principals represented by its founding fathers. Remember? One of these was \"no taxation without representation\". I have spent the total years of my adulthood unlearning that crap from only a few years of my childhood. These days anyone who really stands up for that principal is promptly labeled a \"crackpot\", traitor and worse. While very few working people would say they haven't had their fair share of taxes (as can I), in my lifetime I can say with a great degree of certainty that there has never been a politician cast a vote on any matter with the likes of me or my interests in mind. Nor, for that matter, are they the least bit interested in me or anything I have to say. Why is it that a handful of thugs and plunderers can commit unthinkable atrocities (and in the case of the GM executives, for scores of years) and when it's time for their gravy train to crash under the weight of their gluttony and overwhelming stupidity, the force of the full federal government has no difficulty coming to their aid within days if not hours? Yet at the same time, the joke we call the American medical system, including the drug and insurance companies, are murdering tens of thousands of people a year and stealing from the corpses and victims they cripple, and this country's leaders don't see this as important as bailing out a few of their vile, rich cronies. Yet, the political \"representatives\" (thieves, liars, and self-serving scumbags is far more accurate) have endless time to sit around for year after year and debate the state of the \"terrible health care problem\". It's clear they see no crisis as long as the dead people don't get in the way of their corporate profits rolling in. And justice? You've got to be kidding! How can any rational individual explain that white elephant conundrum in the middle of our tax system and, indeed, our entire legal system? Here we have a system that is, by far, too complicated for the brightest of the master scholars to understand. Yet, it mercilessly \"holds accountable\" its victims, claiming that they're responsible for fully complying with laws not even the experts understand. The law \"requires\" a signature on the bottom of a tax filing; yet no one can say truthfully that they understand what they are signing; if that's not \"duress\" than what is. If this is not the measure of a totalitarian regime, nothing is. How did I get here? My introduction to the real American nightmare starts back in the early '80s. Unfortunately after more than 16 years of school, somewhere along the line I picked up the absurd, pompous notion that I could read and understand plain English. Some friends introduced me to a group of people who were having 'tax code' readings and discussions. In particular, zeroed in on a section relating to the wonderful \"exemptions\" that make institutions like the vulgar, corrupt Catholic Church so incredibly wealthy. We carefully studied the law (with the help of some of the \"best\", high-paid, experienced tax lawyers in the business), and then began to do exactly what the \"big boys\" were doing (except that we weren't steeling from our congregation or lying to the government about our massive profits in the name of God). We took a great deal of care to make it all visible, following all of the rules, exactly the way the law said it was to be done. The intent of this exercise and our efforts was to bring about a much-needed re-evaluation of the laws that allow the monsters of organized religion to make such a mockery of people who earn an honest living. However, this is where I learned that there are two \"interpretations\" for every law; one for the very rich, and one for the rest of us... Oh, and the monsters are the very ones making and enforcing the laws; the inquisition is still alive and well today in this country. That little lesson in patriotism cost me $40,000+, 10 years of my life, and set my retirement plans back to 0. It made me realize for the first time that I live in a country with an ideology that is based on a total and complete lie. It also made me realize, not only how naive I had been, but also the incredible stupidity of the American public; that they buy, hook, line, and sinker, the crap about their \"freedom\"... and that they continue to do so with eyes closed in the face of overwhelming evidence and all that keeps happening in front of them. Before even having to make a shaky recovery from the sting of the first lesson on what justice really means in this country (around 1984 after making my way through engineering school and still another five years of \"paying my dues\"), I felt I finally had to take a chance of launching my dream of becoming an independent engineer. On the subjects of engineers and dreams of independence, I should digress somewhat to say that I'm sure that I inherited the fascination for creative problem solving from my father. I realized this at a very young age. The significance of independence, however, came much later during my early years of college; at the age of 18 or 19 when I was living on my own as student in an apartment in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania. My neighbor was an elderly retired woman (80+ seemed ancient to me at that age) who was the widowed wife of a retired steel worker. Her husband had worked all his life in the steel mills of central Pennsylvania with promises from big business and the union that, for his 30 years of service, he would have a pension and medical care to look forward to in his retirement. Instead he was one of the thousands who got nothing because the incompetent mill management and corrupt union (not to mention the government) raided their pension funds and stole their retirement. All she had was social security to live on. In retrospect, the situation was laughable because here I was living on peanut butter and bread (or Ritz crackers when I could afford to splurge) for months at a time. When I got to know this poor figure and heard her story I felt worse for her plight than for my own (I, after all, I thought I had everything to in front of me). I was genuinely appalled at one point, as we exchanged stories and commiserated with each other over our situations, when she in her grandmotherly fashion tried to convince me that I would be \"healthier\" eating cat food (like her) rather than trying to get all my substance from peanut butter and bread. I couldn't quite go there, but the impression was made. I decided that I didn't trust big business to take care of me, and that I would take responsibility for my own future and myself. Return to the early '80s, and here I was off to a terrifying start as a 'wet-behind-the-ears' contract software engineer... and two years later, thanks to the fine backroom, midnight effort by the sleazy executives of Arthur Andersen (the very same folks who later brought us Enron and other such calamities) and an equally sleazy New York Senator (Patrick Moynihan), we saw the passage of 1986 tax reform act with its section 1706. For you who are unfamiliar, here is the core text of the IRS Section 1706, defining the treatment of workers (such as contract engineers) for tax purposes. Visit this link for a conference committee report (http://www.synergistech.com/1706.shtml#ConferenceCommitteeReport) regarding the intended interpretation of Section 1706 and the relevant parts of Section 530, as amended. For information on how these laws affect technical services workers and their clients, read our discussion here (http://www.synergistech.com/ic-taxlaw.shtml). SEC. 1706. TREATMENT OF CERTAIN TECHNICAL PERSONNEL. (a) IN GENERAL - Section 530 of the Revenue Act of 1978 is amended by adding at the end thereof the following new subsection: (d) EXCEPTION. - This section shall not apply in the case of an individual who pursuant to an arrangement between the taxpayer and another person, provides services for such other person as an engineer, designer, drafter, computer programmer, systems analyst, or other similarly skilled worker engaged in a similar line of work. (b) EFFECTIVE DATE. - The amendment made by this section shall apply to remuneration paid and services rendered after December 31, 1986. Note: ?? \"another person\" is the client in the traditional job-shop relationship. ?? \"taxpayer\" is the recruiter, broker, agency, or job shop. ?? \"individual\", \"employee\", or \"worker\" is you. Admittedly, you need to read the treatment to understand what it is saying but it's not very complicated. The bottom line is that they may as well have put my name right in the text of section (d). Moreover, they could only have been more blunt if they would have came out and directly declared me a criminal and non-citizen slave. Twenty years later, I still can't believe my eyes. During 1987, I spent close to $5000 of my 'pocket change', and at least 1000 hours of my time writing, printing, and mailing to any senator, congressman, governor, or slug that might listen; none did, and they universally treated me as if I was wasting their time. I spent countless hours on the L.A. freeways driving to meetings and any and all of the disorganized professional groups who were attempting to mount a campaign against this atrocity. This, only to discover that our efforts were being easily derailed by a few moles from the brokers who were just beginning to enjoy the windfall from the new declaration of their \"freedom\". Oh, and don't forget, for all of the time I was spending on this, I was loosing income that I couldn't bill clients. After months of struggling it had clearly gotten to be a futile exercise. The best we could get for all of our trouble is a pronouncement from an IRS mouthpiece that they weren't going to enforce that provision (read harass engineers and scientists). This immediately proved to be a lie, and the mere existence of the regulation began to have its impact on my bottom line; this, of course, was the intended effect. Again, rewind my retirement plans back to 0 and shift them into idle. If I had any sense, I clearly should have left abandoned engineering and never looked back. Instead I got busy working 100-hour workweeks. Then came the L.A. depression of the early 1990s. Our leaders decided that they didn't need the all of those extra Air Force bases they had in Southern California, so they were closed; just like that. The result was economic devastation in the region that rivaled the widely publicized Texas S&L fiasco. However, because the government caused it, no one gave a shit about all of the young families who lost their homes or street after street of boarded up houses abandoned to the wealthy loan companies who received government funds to \"shore up\" their windfall. Again, I lost my retirement. Years later, after weathering a divorce and the constant struggle trying to build some momentum with my business, I find myself once again beginning to finally pick up some speed. Then came the .COM bust and the 911 nightmare. Our leaders decided that all aircraft were grounded for what seemed like an eternity; and long after that, 'special' facilities like San Francisco were on security alert for months. This made access to my customers prohibitively expensive. Ironically, after what they had done the Government came to the aid of the airlines with billions of our tax dollars ... as usual they left me to rot and die while they bailed out their rich, incompetent cronies WITH MY MONEY! After these events, there went my business but not quite yet all of my retirement and savings. By this time, I'm thinking that it might be good for a change. Bye to California, I'll try Austin for a while. So I moved, only to find out that this is a place with a highly inflated sense of self-importance and where damn little real engineering work is done. I've never experienced such a hard time finding work. The rates are 1/3 of what I was earning before the crash, because pay rates here are fixed by the three or four large companies in the area who are in collusion to drive down prices and wages... and this happens because the justice department is all on the take and doesn't give a fuck about serving anyone or anything but themselves and their rich buddies. To survive, I was forced to cannibalize my savings and retirement, the last of which was a small IRA. This came in a year with mammoth expenses and not a single dollar of income. I filed no return that year thinking that because I didn't have any income there was no need. The sleazy government decided that they disagreed. But they didn't notify me in time for me to launch a legal objection so when I attempted to get a protest filed with the court I was told I was no longer entitled to due process because the time to file ran out. Bend over for another $10,000 helping of justice. So now we come to the present. After my experience with the CPA world, following the business crash I swore that I'd never enter another accountant's office again. But here I am with a new marriage and a boatload of undocumented income, not to mention an expensive new business asset, a piano, which I had no idea how to handle. After considerable thought I decided that it would be irresponsible NOT to get professional help; a very big mistake. When we received the forms back I was very optimistic that they were in order. I had taken all of the years information to Bill Ross, and he came back with results very similar to what I was expecting. Except that he had neglected to include the contents of Sheryl's unreported income; $12,700 worth of it. To make matters worse, Ross knew all along this was missing and I didn't have a clue until he pointed it out in the middle of the audit. By that time it had become brutally evident that he was representing himself and not me. This left me stuck in the middle of this disaster trying to defend transactions that have no relationship to anything tax-related (at least the tax-related transactions were poorly documented). Things I never knew anything about and things my wife had no clue would ever matter to anyone. The end result is... well, just look around. I remember reading about the stock market crash before the \"great\" depression and how there were wealthy bankers and businessmen jumping out of windows when they realized they screwed up and lost everything. Isn't it ironic how far we've come in 60 years in this country that they now know how to fix that little economic problem; they just steal from the middle class (who doesn't have any say in it, elections are a joke) to cover their asses and it's \"business-as-usual\". Now when the wealthy fuck up, the poor get to die for the mistakes... isn't that a clever, tidy solution. As government agencies go, the FAA is often justifiably referred to as a tombstone agency, though they are hardly alone. The recent presidential puppet GW Bush and his cronies in their eight years certainly reinforced for all of us that this criticism rings equally true for all of the government. Nothing changes unless there is a body count (unless it is in the interest of the wealthy sows at the government trough). In a government full of hypocrites from top to bottom, life is as cheap as their lies and their self-serving laws. I know I'm hardly the first one to decide I have had all I can stand. It has always been a myth that people have stopped dying for their freedom in this country, and it isn't limited to the blacks, and poor immigrants. I know there have been countless before me and there are sure to be as many after. But I also know that by not adding my body to the count, I insure nothing will change. I choose to not keep looking over my shoulder at \"big brother\" while he strips my carcass, I choose not to ignore what is going on all around me, I choose not to pretend that business as usual won't continue; I have just had enough. I can only hope that the numbers quickly get too big to be white washed and ignored that the American zombies wake up and revolt; it will take nothing less. I would only hope that by striking a nerve that stimulates the inevitable double standard, knee-jerk government reaction that results in more stupid draconian restrictions people wake up and begin to see the pompous political thugs and their mindless minions for what they are. Sadly, though I spent my entire life trying to believe it wasn't so, but violence not only is the answer, it is the only answer. The cruel joke is that the really big chunks of shit at the top have known this all along and have been laughing, at and using this awareness against, fools like me all along. I saw it written once that the definition of insanity is repeating the same process over and over and expecting the outcome to suddenly be different. I am finally ready to stop this insanity. Well, Mr. Big Brother IRS man, let's try something different; take my pound of flesh and sleep well. The communist creed: From each according to his ability, to each according to his need.

            "article_content": "A look at Americans and health insurance As Democrats have pushed for a comprehensive overhaul of the country's health system, much of their plans and rhetoric have focused on providing coverage for America's uninsured. Although that effort stalled following Massachusetts Republican Scott Brown's election to the Senate, President Barack Obama reiterated that imperative in his State of the Union address last month. \"By the time I'm finished speaking tonight,\" Obama said, \"more Americans will have lost their health insurance. Millions will lose it this year.\" He continued, \"I will not walk away from these Americans.\" Here's a look at who those Americans are. How many Americans are uninsured? According to the Census Bureau, in 2008, more than 46 million Americans, about 15 percent of the population, did not have health insurance. Some experts believe the number is now larger because of the recession. Who are the uninsured? Low income is a strong factor in identifying the uninsured. About two-thirds of Americans without coverage earn less than twice the federal poverty level, which is $22,050 for a family of four. Almost 25 percent of the uninsured are eligible for Medicaid, the federal-state program to cover the poor, but are not enrolled. The vast majority of the uninsured - 80 percent - are in working families. And, a higher percentage of minorities are uninsured than whites. Nearly 80 percent are U.S. citizens, and 15 percent are undocumented immigrants. The uninsured rate for people between the ages of 19 and 29 is 30 percent, the highest rate of any age group. Although many of these young people are working, their wages are often low, and they may find coverage unaffordable. People whose employers don't offer health benefits may also find more costly individual insurance plans too expensive. For others, prior medical conditions can restrict their access to coverage. And still others, believing that they are in good health and will not need it, opt not to buy insurance. The uninsured are less healthy than the rest of the population. While about 60 percent report they are in excellent or very good health, 10 percent say they are in poor or fair health. That's twice as many as those with coverage. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's latest National Health Interview Survey, released in December, found that 7.2 percent of Americans put off \"needed medical care\" in the first six months of last year. Even though the latest Census Bureau figures indicate that more children slipped into poverty in 2008, their uninsured rate dropped from 11 percent in 2007 to 9.9 percent in 2008. The decline reflected the expansion of two government programs: the Children's Health Insurance Program and Medicaid. Who pays the medical bills of the uninsured? A 2008 study in the journal Health Affairs estimated that uninsured patients received about $86 billion in care in 2008. Of that amount, $30 billion came out of their pockets, leaving more than $56 billion in uncompensated care: $35 billion for hospitals; nearly $14 billion for community-based providers and close to $8 billion for private physicians. Some of those uncompensated costs are recouped by hospitals and providers through government programs established to help subsidize care for the poor. Charities also provide some support, such as funding free clinics. The remainder is shifted to insurers and their customers in the form of higher charges for health care. The Health Affairs study estimated that insurers and customers paid $14.1 billion toward the uninsured, although other groups, including the liberal health advocacy group Families USA, argue that insurers and customers bear even more of the burden. How could Congressional health overhaul proposals affect the uninsured? The Democratic proposals passed by the House and Senate - in limbo for now - would require most people to buy coverage. Those earning less than the poverty level, members of Indian tribes and people with religious objections to health insurance are among those who would not have to carry insurance. The House bill would also require many employers to offer coverage, and the Senate version would levy penalties on large employers that choose not to do so. Both proposals would establish insurance \"exchanges\" with standardized benefits to enable individuals or businesses to compare and buy plans. The bills would expand Medicaid coverage to include some people who don't qualify now for various reasons, including their incomes, and would provide subsidies to help people (some earning up to four times the poverty level) buy insurance. At least 9 percent of uninsured Americans make too much money to get subsidies under the  bills. And some people who receive subsidies may still find that the total cost of insurance, including co-payments and deductibles, to be either unaffordable or undesirable. Illegal immigrants would not be eligible for the expanded Medicaid programs and would not receive subsidies. The Senate plan would bar illegal immigrants from buying insurance through the exchanges. The bills also seek to reduce the number of uninsured by barring private insurers from rejecting applicants who have pre-existing conditions. Republican proposals would make access more available to uninsured by promoting state-run high-risk pools and health exchanges to help consumers choose affordable plans. The GOP would also allow individuals to buy policies across state lines and  provide refundable tax credits to buy insurance. The CBO estimates that the Senate bill would reduce the number of uninsured by about 31 million, the main GOP plan would reduce the number by about 3 million.

He says California, home to some of the nation's highest-wage earners, has been getting the short end of the tax stick for years, paying more to the federal government than it receives in return.  In 2008*, 35 states received more in federal spending than did California, according to the U.S. Census. Here, a look at the top and bottom 10 takers of federal money in fiscal year 2008.    Total federal government expenditure for fiscal year 2008: $2,792,611,000,000 *Most recent year for which figures are available Source: U.S. Census, Consolidated Federal Funds Report for Fiscal Year 2008 \"For each dollar that we pay, we only get 77 cents back,\" Schwarzenegger said. \"So there is room to play with. I'm absolutely convinced that we can get help, and that we will get help.\" And yet, more than six years later, at the presentation of his new budget in early January, the governor \u2014 and the state \u2014 are still waiting. \"I promised the people of California that I will be fighting for California, and that I will go and do everything I can to get the federal money that we deserve,\" Schwarzenegger says. Federal Funding 'Unfair' This time, though, the governor has taken the demand for more federal money to a new level. His final budget \u2014 and maybe in some ways, his legacy \u2014 now hinge on $7 billion in new money from the feds. That includes $5 billion for things like health care for the poor and welfare assistance; $1 billion for special education programs; $95 million for foster care; and reimbursement for the cost of housing prison inmates who are undocumented immigrants. \"For us to get stuck with the bill of incarceration of undocumented immigrants of $900 million is unfair,\" Schwarzenegger says. \"We're going to fly to Washington, and we're going to fight for that money.\" Lately, the governor has been fighting mostly with members of his own congressional delegation, jabbing them for not doing more to level the playing field for Californians.  Now, they are jabbing back. \"The whole premise that somehow California is being disproportionately treated is just false,\" says Rep. Zoe Lofgren. The Democrat says that for one thing, Schwarzenegger is using old data.  She says a recent review that takes into account federal stimulus money suggests California is getting as much as $1.45 in federal services for every dollar in taxes. Lofgren also says that while the state's sluggish economy could still use some help, Schwarzenegger is spending too much time blaming the federal government. \"To pretend that he's not the governor and somehow he doesn't have a role in the continuing saga of the California budget nightmare is really a disappointment,\" she says. Others say the governor is asking for the wrong money, the wrong way. Dozens of states find their budgets in the red this year, they say, and Schwarzenegger would be smart to have allies in the fight for federal help. \"If you want to win the support of Congress, our governor should be going to Washington arm in arm with the 40 or 45 other governors who are also facing budget shortfalls this year,\" says Jean Ross, who leads the California Budget Project, which advocates for programs aimed at the working poor. Ross says the governor should focus his D.C. lobbying on a second national stimulus package. In the first one, California was awarded $85 billion \u2014 more than any other state. Schwarzenegger said last week that a second stimulus wouldn't solve the problem. The question, though, is if he hasn't gotten what he's wanted from the feds in the past, when things were better, does he have the political leverage to get it now, when his job approval numbers are low and he's in the final year of his term?",

            "article_content": "A year ago this week, Barack Obama stood on the steps of the U.S. Capitol to take the presidential oath of office. That moment was described throughout the media as the climax of a journey that began 46 years earlier, at the other end of the National Mall, when Martin Luther King Jr. gave his \"I Have a Dream\" speech on the steps of the Lincoln Memorial. But Peniel Joseph, a historian at Tufts University, says not enough attention has been paid to the other main line of succession in African-American leadership \u2014 the one that leads from Malcolm X, Stokely Carmichael and the black power movement. \"The connection between black power and Barack Obama doesn't fit a neat and simplistic national narrative about the success and evolution of the civil rights struggle,\" Joseph tells NPR's Guy Raz. In his latest book, Dark Days, Bright Nights: From Black Power to Barack Obama, Joseph argues that the black nationalists have been too easily dismissed as a formative force. \"Black power is usually characterized as a movement of gun-toting militants who practice politics without portfolio,\" he says, \"and drag down a more promising movement for social justice, the civil rights movement.\" That image, Joseph says, forced President Obama to distance himself from those roots. \"The president and the popular media don't often look at the quieter side of black power, the pragmatic side,\" he says, pointing out that Malcolm X and Carmichael both started their public careers as community organizers \u2014 a path that Obama took 30 years later. \"Malcolm X is the quintessential, self-made African-American political activist,\" Joseph says. \"The president and the popular media don't often look at the quieter side of black power,\" author Peniel Joseph says.\n                \n                    \n                    Courtesy Basic Books\n                    \n                \nhide caption \"The president and the popular media don't often look at the quieter side of black power,\" author Peniel Joseph says. After a troubled childhood and his father's death at the hands of a lynch mob, Malcolm X spent six years in prison. He emerged in 1952 as a member of the Nation of Islam and quickly grew into a national spokesman for the more militant wing of the civil rights movement. Malcolm X was gunned down in 1965, a few years after leaving the Nation of Islam. A year later, Stokely Carmichael coined the term \"black power,\" and the group of activists he created was rechristened the Black Panthers. So how would those two leaders have viewed the country's first African-American president? \"They would have looked at this as a mixed blessing,\" Joseph says. \"On the one hand, Malcolm X and Stokely Carmichael would have been impressed by Obama's self-determination. ... At the same time, both would have criticized the president for a reluctance to talk about racial matters and for a reluctance to really use the presidency as a bully pulpit\" to address specific African-American issues.

Then, as now, the census numbers affected the number of House members given to each state. As census workers prepare to collect data this year on an estimated 308 million Americans, politicians are getting ready to re-wage some old battles, with seats in Congress and billions in federal funds at stake. Local and federal officials have been holding \"census kickoff\" events around the country for weeks, and with good reason: The census is more than just an official head count. It also will be used to dole out House seats in time for the 2012 election, with some states getting more seats and others likely to lose representatives.  Texas could gain four congressional seats on top of the 32 it already holds, while Ohio could lose two of its 18 seats, according to Polidata, a political data analysis firm. The major demographic themes of the past few census counts are likely to remain largely intact, experts say, as the population growth in Southern and Western states outpaces the Rust Belt and East Coast. But even the most optimistic estimates for California predict it will remain static for the first time since 1850, when it became a state. Some forecasts even have it losing a seat. In California \"the bloom is off the rose,\" says Polidata's Clark Benson. The state has \"had a little in-migration, but they've had a lot of out-migration.\" \"The whole trick here is the pace of population growth,\" he says. \"It's not enough to gain people. You've got to do it at a faster pace than other states.\" The bottom line is that while California is still growing, it's not growing as fast as some other states, Benson says. Larry Sabato, the director of the University of Virginia's Center for Politics, also thinks California will neither lose nor gain seats, but he said if the state doesn't do well in \"ferreting out its Hispanic population,\" it could lose a seat. Meanwhile, all eyes are on \"the real megapowerhouse\" of Texas, Sabato says. At first glance, the likely addition of three or four seats in such a solid red state should be good news for Republicans, who currently hold every statewide office and both houses of the state Legislature. But redrawing congressional districts is the job of legislatures and governors, so the results of 2010 state elections are crucial. Of the governorships, 37 are up for grabs this year and most of them will be open seats, thanks largely to term-limited incumbents, such as California Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger. An additional 5,000 or so state legislative seats will also be in play. It's rare, however, for the party in control of the White House to improve its position in the states in midterm years, says Tim Storey, a senior fellow at the National Conference of State Legislatures, a bipartisan organization that serves state legislators. Only during President Franklin Roosevelt's tenure and again in 2002, which he attributes mainly to the \"9/11 effect,\" has that trend been bucked. \"It's a really solid trend and one that concerns Democrats this time around, especially with control of redistricting on the table,\" Storey says. Even so, \"Democrats might still be able to play a major role in line drawing and thwart complete GOP control of the process if they can win just two seats in the Texas House,\" he acknowledges. There's also no guarantee that newly created districts in Texas, for example, will go to Republicans, says Sabato, who believes two of the projected four new districts will be heavily Hispanic and therefore likely to be won by Democrats. It is part of a larger trend set to ultimately turn Texas from a red state to a blue state sometime in the 2020s, he says. By contrast to Texas, Ohio \u2014 a key swing state in presidential elections \u2014 could lose two seats, causing it \"to lose some impact, but that doesn't mean it isn't still going to be a battleground,\" Benson says. The Midwest and Northeast are also projected to lose seats. New York, Pennsylvania, Massachusetts, New Jersey, Illinois, Iowa, Michigan and Minnesota \u2014 along with Louisiana in the South are all forecast by Polidata to lose one seat each. What's more, Sabato contends, is that the exodus from California has spread Democratic voters to places such as Nevada, Colorado, Arizona and New Mexico. \"California is bleeding Democrats and that is changing the political demographics in these other states,\" he says. The NCSL's Storey says it's important not to overstate the power of the legislatures when it comes to redistricting. \"There's something of a myth of gerrymandering. You have to draw districts where the population has grown, and you have to comply with many other states and federal laws and criteria.\" The census is about more than just electoral politics. It's also about how and where $400 billion in federal money is spent. That's where problems of undercounting minorities and immigrants, both legal and otherwise, could have the most impact, says Andrew Reamer, a political analyst at the Brookings Institution. \"As undocumented residents receive public services, governments could be shortchanged with a less than accurate count,\" Reamer says. Thanks to improvements in the process, the count has been getting much more accurate, according to Storey and others. In the past few decades, the involvement of community outreach groups to help track down hard-to-find respondents has helped tremendously, he says. \"Is it ever going to be perfect? No. They never find everybody and sometimes they double-count,\" he says. \"But, given the task at hand, I think the process is extraordinarily accurate.\"",

Luis Gutierrez (D-IL), a member of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus, speaks at a rally for immigration reform on the U.S. Capitol grounds in October. The packed legislative agenda of 2009 left little room after health care, climate change and the financial overhaul to tackle immigration issues. The last time President Obama even broached the topic of illegal immigrants before Congress was during his September speech on health care, and frankly, things didn't go so well. That was the night South Carolina Republican Joe Wilson made headlines for yelling \"You lie!\" at the president. Since then, little about the topic has come out of the Senate or the House. Still, immigration has not been forgotten, and it could make an appearance in 2010. Members of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus, vowing to put the issue front and center, have come up with their own proposal for what they call comprehensive immigration reform. \"Just because we have been patient doesn't mean we could wait forever,\" Rep. Luis Gutierrez (D-IL) said at a recent news conference while surrounded by Latino children wearing T-shirts that read \"future voter.\" He and the caucus introduced a bill that would put undocumented workers on a path to citizenship -- if they pay a $500 fine, learn English and undergo a criminal background check. The bill would also provide more training for border guards and seek better conditions at immigration detention centers. But after a conservative backlash sent the last major immigration overhaul effort down in flames in 2007, Gutierrez says, he knows what he's up against. \"Opponents of immigration reform will use it as a wedge issue and will blame everything from unemployment to rising health care costs on immigrants,\" he says. \"Of course, why stop at jobs and health care? Global warming? Rough stock market? Bad traffic? Lousy weather? Too many immigrants!\" But what Gutierrez calls the blame game, opponents are calling the new economic reality. Republican Rep. Steve King of Iowa is already digging in his heels. \"I think the change in the dynamics in this immigration debate is that now instead of a 4.6 percent unemployment rate, it's a 10 percent unemployment now, more than twice as much unemployment,\" King says. \"It's clear there are at least 8 million jobs today [that] are held by people here illegally. Those are jobs that Americans can and will do.\" King and other Republicans say they have several core positions: They oppose what they call amnesty; they support a locked-down border; and they want employers to verify that everyone they hire is a U.S. citizen. But Democrats say they have reasons to be optimistic, because the atmosphere has changed since 2007. First, high unemployment has slowed the flow of illegal immigrants. Homeland Security officials say security is better than it was back then, with the addition of thousands more border patrol officers and hundreds of miles of new border fencing. Still, the Obama administration isn't planning to make a move until Congress is ready. And Democrats may be more concerned about the midterm elections. \"You may see some Democratic House members just, you know, looking at bridges thinking of jumping off,\" says Charlie Cook of the Cook Political Report newsletter. Cook says in the House alone, there are upwards of 60 Democrats in competitive districts. They have already had to take politically tough votes on climate change, health care and the economic stimulus package. But the partisan battling has left both parties damaged. \"Republicans have to be careful because they come across as anti-Hispanic and immigrant bashing, and Democrats are looking bad because it looks like they are trying to shove too much down the throats of people who are only interested in job creation and getting the economy turned around,\" Cook explains. With the battle over health care still churning, action on immigration is uncertain at best. In the Senate, Democrat Charles Schumer of New York is drafting legislation with the help of South Carolina Republican Lindsey Graham. Lawmakers have discouraged smaller immigration bills from moving separately to preserve some political energy for a comprehensive measure they hope to move early next year.",

At the top of the screen, there's the obligatory Wikipedia entry: \"The Tea Party movement is a populist political movement in the United States that emerged in 2009 through a series of locally and nationally coordinated protests.\" Then there's the Tea Party site that lists local organizations; the TeaParty.org site featuring its founder, Dale Robertson; the American Family Association's Tea Party Day site; the Tea Party Express site that solicits funds for Tea Party candidates and on and on. Google \"American Tea Party\" and you get pretty much the same roster of websites. Somewhat lost in all of the lists is the original American Tea Party, the 1773 revolt by Boston colonists against British rule, a rebellion that turned out to be a seminal moment in the American Revolution. The rhetoric of today's Tea Party movement is seasoned with words and phrases from the 18th century. Tea Party Patriots, for instance, \"is a community committed to standing together, shoulder to shoulder, to protect our country and the Constitution upon which we were founded!\" There was a time when the words \"Tea Party\" conjured up Revolutionary soldiers, muskets in hand, forming a phalanx of resistance to oppression. Now the phrase brings to mind former Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin, a Glenn Beck rally and Delaware Senate candidate Christine O'Donnell on the campaign trail. What are the similarities and differences between today's Tea Partiers and the 18th-century Revolutionaries? To casual students of American history, the admixture of these two tea parties -- present and past -- can lead to confusion. Vexation About Representation At the Boston Tea Party Ships and Museum, for instance, people call in looking for information about the present-day Tea Party. The ships and museum, says spokesperson Shawn P. Ford, are tourist attractions that commemorate the event of Dec. 16, 1773 -- when men, disguised as Mohawk Indians, tossed crates of British tea into Boston Harbor to protest the royal government's tea tax. Then: An artist's depiction of the original Tea Party.\n                \n                    \n                    Three Lions/Hulton Archive/Getty Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption Today's Tea Party, Ford says, \"has nothing to do with us. When I do get calls about the Tea Party movement, it is a simple misunderstanding.\" Misunderstanding, yes. Simple, not always. Kathy Laughlin makes sure her students know the difference. Laughlin, who teaches Advanced Placement U.S. history at William Byrd High School in Vinton, Va., says she has been teaching her students about the Boston Tea Party as part of a \"Road to Revolution unit\" this school year. She pre-empted questions about the contemporary Tea Party. \"I explained that the current movement deals with big government and excess taxes much like the colonials did, but that the colonials truly had no representation in the legislature that was instituting their taxes,\" Laughlin says. Laughlin goes on to explain to her students that today's Tea Partiers have representation; they are just not pleased with the representatives.\u00a0 \"Therefore,\" she says, \"the present movement's goal is to unseat incumbents and elect ultra-conservative members to congress.\" You Say You Want A Revolution Rep. Michele Bachmann (R-MN), one of the GOP lawmakers who has cultivated and won support from the Tea Party movement, has said it represents \"mainstream American people who have decided to get up off the couch because they want to take their country back.\" At a midsummer 2010 news conference, she said, \"They've come essentially under a banner of three things, and it's this: They believe that we are 'Taxed Enough Already,' that the federal government should not spend more money than it takes in, and that Congress should act within the constitutional limitations as given to us by the Founding Fathers.\" Rep. Michele Bachmann (R-MN), a Tea Party favorite.\n                \n                    \n                    Alex Wong/Getty Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption The 18th century was also invoked when Bret Baier, writing for Fox News in March 2009, reported on the nationwide gathering of \"tea party protests.\" The rallies against excessive government spending, Baier wrote, were \"inspired by the Revolutionary War-era Boston Tea Party protesting British taxation. Protesters had signs reading 'Give us liberty, not debt' and 'Where's my bailout?' \" The Tea Party movement, which has succeeded in knocking off some Republican lawmakers deemed not conservative enough, has become a conflationary catch-all for many disgruntled citizens. Jill Lepore, a history professor at Harvard University and author of the soon-to-be-published The Whites of Their Eyes: The Tea Party's Revolution and the Battle over American History, says agitated Americans have been expropriating various aspects of the American Revolution since 1776. In her book, she points to George Ticknor Curtis, a Massachusetts attorney and historian who wrote The True Uses of American Revolutionary History in 1841. \"He was hopping mad about the tea partiers of his day,\" Lepore writes. \"He was sick of people invoking the Revolution to ad\u00advance a cause. ... He just wished people would study the Revolution instead of using it to make political arguments.\" In an interview, Lepore says, \"What most people know about the American Revolution, they learned in elementary school.\" Common understanding of the events leading up to, and following, the Declaration of Independence, Lepore says, \"is a little bit comic-booky. It has a comic quality to it, an association with childhood, paper dolls, Johnny Tremain.\" Because of that only-distant familiarity, the American Revolution is still malleable -- and often misunderstood -- in the political imagination. For instance, she says, the Revolution was not a single act of rebellion; \"It was a decades-long struggle about the nature of government.\" Taxation was only one aspect of the debate. In fact, \"the tea tax that led to the Boston Tea Party actually reduced the price of tea.\" Many people who are drawn to Tea Party rhetoric, Lepore says, think the American Revolution \"was a time of unity.\" But in fact, the Revolution \"was a fragile experiment.\" One-third of the colonists were in favor of revolt, one-third were against it and one-third were neutral, she says. Most of those opposed to the Revolution left the country after independence was declared. \"People in the 18th century saw the Revolution as a civil war --\u00a0 between those who wanted independence and those who didn't.\" Americans \"want to look to a common past.\" But the idea of a unified-in-purpose nation, she says, \"has its origins in 19th-century romantic nationalism.\" She encourages her students and others to wrestle with the true meanings of the American Revolution. This questioning of what the tea parties --\u00a0 present and past -- are all about \"is an important part of our political debate.\" And so the arguments rage on. The Gut Issue There is one valid point of comparison between today's Tea Partiers and the 18th-century Revolutionaries, says Jack Rakove, a professor of American history at Stanford University and author of several critically acclaimed books on the Revolutionary era. The Tea Act of 1773 that sparked the Boston Tea Party, Rakove says, was born of the crown's collusion with corporate Britain -- the East India Trading Co. So if Tea Partiers are up in arms over the American government being in cahoots with the corporate world -- say, over the Bush and Obama administrations' handling of the Troubled Assets Relief Program that bailed out many faltering financial institutions -- the present-day dismay would have legitimate roots in the ire of yesteryear. \"That wouldn't be implausible,\" Rakove says. But where the comparison between Now and Then breaks down, says Rakove, echoing high school teacher Laughlin, \"is the basic issue of representation.\" Tea Partiers today have representation in government, Rakove says. The Boston Tea Party participants did not. The Boston Tea Party was staged in response to the British Parliament handing down laws and meting out taxes willy-nilly to colonists who had no vote, no say-so in their own destiny. \"That was the gut issue of the American Revolution.\" But still, the debate is being played out in classrooms and in Google searches across the country -- and at the Boston Tea Party museum in Boston. The museum, which is under renovation, is scheduled to reopen in the summer of 2011. \"As of this moment and time,\" says Ford, the museum spokesperson, \"we have no plans to incorporate the Tea Party movement in any of our interpretations.\"",

Since that time, a political fissure has emerged within Iran's conservative camp, threatening possible open conflict between the two men. Political turmoil seems to be the norm in Iran: Last year it was the reformist opposition taking to the streets challenging what they saw as the fraudulent re-election of President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad. Now another political fissure has emerged within the conservative camp, threatening possible open conflict between Iran's president and its supreme leader. There are significant differences among conservatives in Iran over many issues, but right now the focus is on economic subsidies. The price of basics in Iran, like bread, electricity and gasoline, has been heavily subsidized for decades. But when Ahmahinejad ordered the removal of subsidies two weeks ago, the price of gasoline quadrupled and the price of bread tripled overnight. What's more, Ahmadinejad moved to seize the revenues that would have been used for subsidies for his own purposes. He has begun paying the poorest segments of Iranian society to help mitigate the pain of the price increases. Some estimate the value of the revenues saved at $100 billion, says Abbas Milani, director of Iran studies at Stanford  University. \"They are taking the equivalent of $100 billion out of the economy that helped subsidize peoples' livelihood, and giving back a pittance,\" he said. \"They are giving back the equivalent of $40 per person.\" Conservatives in the Parliament wanted to control these funds, but Ahmadinejad quickly recognized their enormous political value, Milani said. Basically Ahmadinejad has created an enormous system of patronage for himself that he will use to either prolong his own stay in power or put one of his cronies in the presidency. Abbas Milani \"Basically Ahmadinejad has created an enormous system of patronage for himself that he will use to either prolong his own stay in power or put one of his cronies in the presidency,\" he said. That's not to speak of the powerful surge in inflation that is expected to hit Iran in the coming months. Ahmadinejad's move appears to be part of a wider plan to enhance the powers of his own presidency, at the expense of Iran's supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, says Muhammad Sahimi, who writes for the website Tehran Bureau. \"He wants to act independent from Ayatollah Khamenei and he wants to consolidate the power in the office of the president,\" Sahimi said. One example of this was Ahmadinejad's recent firing of Foreign Minister Manouchehr Mottaki. Foreign policy has always been the jurisdiction of the supreme leader. Mottaki was the supreme leader's man, says Omid Memarian, who writes on Iranian affairs for the Inter Press Service. \"He had the support of the Parliament, and also he had the support of the supreme leader,\" he said. \"I talked with different sources and Ahmadinejad dismissed the foreign minister without the approval of the supreme leader.\" Apparently in retaliation, the supreme leader's camp recently resurrected charges of corruption and abuse of power against one of Ahmadinejad's vice presidents and against his chief of staff. In response, Ahmadinejad has become more openly critical of the power of the ayatollahs, a clever move, in Sahimi's view. \"He realizes that the Iranian public is tired of the clerics,\" he said. \"So by being opposed to clerics and also talking about, for example, Iranian culture rather than Islamic culture, that invokes Iranian nationalism rather than Islam, he has tried to create and gather some support among some segments of the society. So that's a shrewd tactic on his part.\" There is one area where the two conservative camps have maintained common purpose -- the repression of the opposition. In recent weeks, a well-known filmmaker has been jailed for six years just for planning a movie about the opposition. An economist has been imprisoned for questioning the accuracy of economic data released by the government. And earlier this week, two people were hanged in Evin prison, one an alleged spy for Israel. All of this is an indication of just how uneasy Iran's leaders continue to feel, Milani says. \"I think they know full well what the population wants, how disgruntled the population are, how worried the people are about the economic situation,\" he said. This is likely to have a significant impact on the still somewhat hidden tensions between the president and the supreme leader, Memarian says. \"We have to see now how the supreme leader reacts to Ahmadinejad's reckless policies,\" he said. \"Because at the end of the day, the supreme leader wants to survive. And if Ahmadinejad is endangering that kind of survival, then you know he has to go too, like many others.\" There is even talk of impeaching Ahmadinejad, but so far no serious move to carry out that threat.",

From organizing workers to preventing war to making the economy more green, journalist Chris Hedges argues that, for decades, liberals have surrendered the good fights to corporations and ruling powers. In his new book, Death of the Liberal Class, Hedges slams five specific groups and institutions -- the Democratic Party, churches, unions, the media and academia -- for failing Americans and allowing for the creation of a \"permanent underclass.\" Hedges says that, for motives ranging from self-preservation to careerism, the \"liberal establishment\" purged radicals from its own ranks and, as a result, lost its checks on capitalism and corporate power. \"For millions of Americans, including the 15 million unemployed Americans,\" Hedges tells NPR'S Neal Conan, \"the suffering is becoming acute.\" He cites a recent trip to Camden, N.J., per capita the poorest city in the nation, as an example. Read An Excerpt \"When you get up and see the human cost of what this has done -- these foreclosures, these bank repossessions, the fact that one in eight Americans and one in four children depend on food stamps to survive,\" Hedges says, it's clear the system has failed. But how is that the fault of, say, the universities? Hedges describes a \"kind of withering of the humanities\" in which the liberal education that would normally ask broad questions and challenge structure and assumptions has become corporate. Academic departments now carry the burden of raising their own funds. \"This is pretty hard to do if you're in the classics department,\" Hedges notes. Hedges says he also faults the \"purging within economics departments and business schools of people who challenged what I call the utopian vision of globalization -- the idea that somehow the marketplace should determine human behavior and guide human activity.\" He says that dynamic is to blame for turning elite, Ivy League universities into, essentially, vocational schools. \"We create classes of systems managers,\" Hedges says, \"highly astute and intelligent in a kind of analytical way \u2026 [who] only know how to service a particular system.\" by Chris Hedges Hardcover, 248 pages | Your purchase helps support NPR programming.

            "article_content": "The issue of immigration reform has been dormant of late on Capitol Hill, and a lack of bipartisanship has been keeping it and some other matters from moving anywhere. The DREAM Act has been talked about for more than a decade. At this 2004 rally in Washington, D.C., supporters held a mock graduation ceremony.\n                \n                    \n                    Alex Wong/Getty Images \n                    \n                \nhide caption But this week, Democrats are seeing if they can open a window of opportunity -- one that could quickly close because of the looming midterm elections. They're looking to attach the DREAM Act to the annual defense policy bill that the Senate is scheduled to take up Tuesday. The measure would put illegal immigrants who come to the United States as children on a path to citizenship if they fulfill several requirements. (DREAM stands for Development, Relief and Education for Alien Minors.) It's one of two high-profile issues that Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid has said will be voted on when senators take up the defense legislation. The other, which is already a part of the defense measure, is repeal of the \"don't ask, don't tell\" policy that bars openly gay Americans from serving in the military. Sen. Dick Durbin (D-IL), has been trying for 10 years to get the DREAM Act through Congress. \"Here is how it works,\" says Durbin. \"The student would have the chance to qualify only if he or she meets these requirements: came to the United States as a child; lived here for more than five years; has good moral character; has not engaged in criminal activity; does not pose any threat to national security; passes a thorough background check; and graduates from an American high school.\" If they meet those tests, young people would qualify for temporary legal status. They would have to go to college or join the military in order to get a green card. The proposal had been floating around Congress without much momentum until last week, when Reid raised eyebrows with the announcement that he wants the DREAM Act added to the annual defense policy bill. Republican Sen. John McCain, his party's 2008 presidential nominee and the ranking minority member on the Senate Armed Services Committee, says this is all about politics. \"This is turning legislation related to our national defense into a vehicle to force a partisan agenda through the Senate -- often on a party line vote,\" he says. According to McCain, the Democrats' \"desperation\" about what could happen to their numbers in Congress this November \"is palpable.\" Reid, who's locked not only in a tight re-election race for his own seat but also has to consider whether his party will still have control of the House and Senate after November, objects to such characterizations. \"I don't think we should talk about how beneficial the Dream Act is for Democrats,\" he says. \"I think we should talk about how fair it is to people who should be able to go to school if they want -- join the military if they want to. It has nothing to do with Democrats [or] with Republicans, and everything to do with fairness.\" Sweeping immigration overhaul bills are considered dead-ends on Capitol Hill because they won't get anything close to bipartisan support. The more narrowly focused DREAM Act has had Republican sponsors, and so is considered by some a foot in a door that stands some chance of passage and perhaps leads to more overhaul efforts in the future. But Mark Krikorian, director of the Center for Immigration Studies, which supports strict immigration control, says Democrats are going to \"get pinched by that door closing on their foot.\" He sees the DREAM Act firing up conservative voters. Democrats, he says, have given opponents \"something specific to work against.\" There will be DREAM Act supporters, though, also lobbying their senators. Carlos Coronel was among some of the hundreds who rallied on Capitol Hill with hundreds of immigration supporters last week. He says his mother, who's from Guatemala, benefited from the 1986 Immigration Reform bill, and he calls the DREAM Act a stepping stone. \"I understand a point of view that it's just a way to get voters excited,\" Coronel says. \"But at the same time, more people are going to stand up and ... come out of the shadows and show how successful such a reform as the Dream Act can be -- which will be like a sample of how great a reform a comprehensive bill would be.\"",

            "article_content": "The DREAM Act which was passed late Wednesday evening by the House in the waning days of Democrat control there moved to the Senate Thursday where it immediately got bogged down. Democrats had hoped to get an outright vote Thursday on the legislation that would provide a path to citizenship for some illegal immigrants who were brought to the U.S. as children. But they didn't have the votes to get past a threatened Republican filibuster which would have required 60 votes. So by a 59-40 vote, Democrats essentially punted until next week. While it will be an uphill battle to get that vote since Republicans are maintaining party discipline, Democrats may get something of a moral victory out of all this. They will be able to point to their votes on the legislation as they further burnish their attractiveness to Hispanic voters, an important and growing segment of the party's base. Hispanic voters have tilted heavily Democratic in recent elections, reversing inroads made by former President Bush. The mostly partisan vote on the DREAM act will likely only deepen that trend. The controversial legislation would allow young illegal immigrants brought into the U.S. as children under age 16 to apply for legal status, allowing those with military service or two years of higher education to get on the path to citizenship. Opponents of the legislation decry it as an amnesty and warn that U.S. taxpayers will eventually wind up subsidizing the college educations and medical care of illegal immigrants. Critics also say it will increase the competition unemployed citizens face at a time of economic uncertainty. While many Senate Republicans are opposing the legislation on the merits, they have put Democrats on notice that they would filibuster all legislation until the Senate passes bills to extend the Bush-era tax cuts and fund the government's operations. Again, Reid is expected to face difficulty finding the votes. But even a failed DREAM Act vote can be a political winner for Democrats. Reid knows the power Hispanic voters intimately. Some experts believe he owes his recent re-election to Hispanic voters fired up by comments by and campaign ads for his opponent Sharron Angle that seemed to play on the fears of non-Hispanics about illegal immigrations and minorities generally.",

The DREAM Act is aimed at illegal immigrants brought here as children by their parents. They would qualify for legal residency if they complete two years of college or two years of military service. But critics say it's still amnesty, and the bill faces long odds in the Senate. Cesar Vargas, a third-year law student in New York, is one of some 2 million young people who would qualify for legal residency under the DREAM Act. He was brought to the U.S. from Mexico by his parents at age 5. Vargas graduated from high school with honors and wants to join the armed forces -- to give back, he says, to his country, the United States. \"I also plan to join the military and join the Marine Corps, either as a JAG officer in the Judge Advocate Corps or [as an] intelligence officer, so it's definitely giving back to my country. That's my core value, and that's what ... the DREAM Act will do,\" Vargas says. 'The Best And The Brightest' To qualify, young people would have to have entered the country by age 16, pass a background check, graduate from high school, and attend college for two years or join the armed forces. \"These are the best and the brightest of the Latino immigrant community and other ethnic communities,\" says Frank Sharry, director of America's Voice, which favors the bill. \"All they want to do is to live the American dream, so that they can contribute to a nation that they call home.\" The measure has the support of Democratic congressional leaders, as well as the Obama administration. In a conference call with reporters last week, Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano said her agency should spend its resources tracking down \"criminal aliens\" -- threats to public safety and national security. \"What doesn't make as much sense is the idea of spending our enforcement resources to prosecute young people who have no criminal records, who were brought here through no fault of their own, so they have no individual culpability, and who now want to go to college or serve in our armed forces,\" she said. A Priority For Democrats Supporters of the DREAM Act are well-organized. They have been staging protests in congressional offices, holding candlelight vigils and running campaign-style ads. One airing in Massachusetts targets Republican Sen. Scott Brown. \"The military, small businesses and 66 percent of voters support the DREAM Act,\" it says. \"Sen. Brown, where do you stand?\" But Brown is unconvinced. He's released a statement calling the DREAM Act a form of amnesty. The measure is a political priority for Democrats. Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid promised to bring the DREAM Act up for a vote during his successful re-election campaign -- in which support from Latinos played a key role. \"This is a last-ditch kind of political stunt,\" says Roy Beck, the director of NumbersUSA, which opposes the bill. \"[House Speaker Nancy] Pelosi and Reid have made some promises to some groups; they've got everything all stirred up. They're going to cause an incredible amount of disappointment among a lot of students around the country on something that ... never had a chance.\" 'An Amnesty' Opponents say the DREAM Act is likely to cost some $6 billion a year -- a charge backers say doesn't add up -- and that it will mean fewer jobs for U.S.-born workers. \"American people did not vote for an amnesty in this past election,\" says Republican Sen. Jeff Sessions of Alabama. \"And it will be resisted with every strength and every ability that I have to do so. Because this is a lame-duck Congress, it will not pass next year, and it's not going to pass this year if I have anything to do about it.\" And Sessions may well have his way. It appears unlikely the DREAM Act has enough votes in the Senate to win approval in the remaining days of this Congress.",

Under the unequivocal headline \"Harry Reid's Botched Battles\" Politico reports that the very voters Reid meant to fire up by tacking on to a defense authorization bill controversial gay rights and immigration legislation have been disappointed by Reid's failure to get enough votes. As has been widely reported, the Senate failed to pass a repeal of the military's \"Don't Ask, Don't Tell,\" ban on gays and lesbians openly serving in uniform and the DREAM Act that would permit young illegal immigrants to gain legal status by attending college or through military service. The suggestion is that instead of revving up the troops for the coming mid-term election, the failure may just have just further dispirited Democrats. A Politico excerpt: The disappointment was widespread. Gay rights groups were upset that the process Reid employed may have undermined progress in repealing the Pentagon\u2019s \u201cdon\u2019t ask, don\u2019t tell\u201d policy prohibiting gays from serving openly in the military. Hispanic groups were disappointed that they couldn\u2019t even get a vote on a narrow piece of comprehensive\u00a0immigration reform \u2014 an amendment known as the DREAM Act that would have enabled citizenship for illegal immigrant students in exchange for government or military service. And Democrats on both sides of the Capitol are unhappy that a debate on gay rights and immigration distracted yet again from issue No. 1:\u00a0jobs. Later in the story, a House Democratic aide suggests that Reid's maneuver was really an example of how all politics is local, that Reid was focused mostly on his own re-election in Nevada which is anything but assured. The most recent polls, for instance, have shown Reid tied in his race against Republican Sharron Angle who is strongly supported by the Tea Party movement. Thus, Reid's inclusion of a repeal of DADT as well as the DREAM Act can readily be interpreted as a move to rally Hispanic voters and to a lesser degree, gay and lesbian citizens, to his cause, i.e., his re-election. But befitting a senator who represents a state with big gambling interests, the move was something of a risky bet by Reid too since he could just as easily cause his opponents to become even more energized in their effort to oust him. In a race as close as the Nevada Senate contest now appears to be, the turnout of a hundred more anti-Reid voters could easily spell defeat for the Senate majority leader.",

The president has had an unusually successful lame duck session of Congress, with the ratification of the New START treaty, the repeal of Don't Ask Don't Tell, and the passage of a tax bill. John B. Judis is a senior editor for The New Republic. After last November's election, one might have expected the Obama White House and Democratic Congress to take six weeks off to mull their defeat.\u00a0Instead, they used the lame duck session in December to win cloture-proof majorities for some very significant bills.\u00a0Just today, the Senate ratified the new START arms control treaty by a whopping 71 to 26 vote.\u00a0On December 18, the Senate voted by 65 to 31 to strike down the Pentagon's \"Don't Ask, Don't Tell\" policy against gays serving openly in the armed forces. Today's ratification of the New Start treaty reduces U.S. and Russian nuclear arsenals, and resumes inspections between the two countries, but its real importance is in strengthening U.S.-Russian relations, which had become frayed under George W. Bush.\u00a0The U.S. needs Russian support to achieve American objectives in Iran, Afghanistan, and East Asia.\u00a0And the treaty's ratification may also boost the stock of Russian President Dmitri Medvedev, with whom Obama negotiated the treaty, at the expense of the more intransigent Prime Minister Vladimir Putin. The votes on\u00a0START and on\u00a0DADT also displayed the outlines of a coalition between Senate Democrats and moderate or moderately conservative Republicans that could overcome the kind of filibuster strategy that the Republican leadership has used over the last two years against administration proposals and appointments. The Republicans who signed onto these bills were willing to put the merits of the legislation above the leadership's attempt to cripple Obama. Utah Senator Robert Bennett and Ohio Senator George Voinovich are leaving the Senate and don't count. But Maine's Olympia Snowe and Susan Collins, Massachusetts's Scott Brown, and Alaska's Lisa Murkowski, who voted for both bills, would seem to constitute a dependable moderate bloc.\u00a0And add to them newly elected Mark Kirk from Illinois (who represents a blue state), North Carolina Senator Richard Burr, Indiana Senator Richard Lugar, and Nevada Senator Jon Ensign (who represent states that Obama carried in 2008), Johnny Isakson (who comes out of suburban Atlanta), and Tennessee Senators Lamar Alexander and Bob Corker (who come from eastern Tennessee, the home in the past of moderate Republicans like Howard Baker.) Obama and the Democrats also won a victory on\u00a0a bill granting health benefits to September 11 responders.\u00a0On Dec. 9, Republican senators used a filibuster to block consideration of the bill.\u00a0But, after the success of DADT, New York Senators Chuck Schumer and Kirsten Gillibrand reintroduced the bill.\u00a0This time, with former\u00a0Mayor Rudy Giuliani and Fox News commentator Shep Smith shaming the Republicans, the bill won unanimous support and passed. Perhaps the most lasting, and controversial, achievement was the passage of the $858 billion tax proposal that the White House worked out with Republican leaders.\u00a0The bill extended the Bush tax cuts for the wealthy another two years and reduced the tax on multi-million dollar estates.\u00a0But it also maintained middle-income tax cuts that would have expired and put into effect a\u00a0two percent payroll tax cut this year.\u00a0While tax cuts for the wealthy may do little to help the economy -- and, over time, hurt it by deepening the deficit\u2014the other tax cuts in the bill promise to jack up the economy by raising consumer demand. There was probably no other way that this administration was going to get Congress to pass a desperately needed stimulus for an economy that still suffers from near\u00a010 percent unemployment.\u00a0And simply doing nothing, and letting all the tax cuts expire in January, would have depressed the economy. So, while the tax bill had serious failings, it was better than the alternative. And Obama and the Democrats deserve credit for making the best deal in the circumstances. Obama and the Democrats didn't win everything this month -- they couldn't beat the filibuster against the DREAM Act -- but they\u00a0won far more than any administration I can remember.\u00a0Those of us who were gravely concerned after the November elections that the Obama White House would be unable to deal with an emboldened Republican Party can take heart from the achievements of this lame duck Congress.",

President Obama used an upbeat, end-of the-year news conference Wednesday to hail the fading lame-duck session as a \"season of progress\" that surprised most who predicted that Congress would run out the session hamstrung by partisanship. \"If there's any lesson to draw from these past few weeks, it's that we are not doomed to endless gridlock,\" Obama said. \"We've shown in the wake of the November elections that we have the capacity not only to make progress but to make progress together.\" The president, clearly relishing his Capitol Hill victories and improved standing with the public, touted his successes that came after the \"shellacking\" -- his word -- that Democrats took in November's midterm elections. The party's losses will translate into a GOP takeover of the House in January, and significant Republican gains in the Democratic-controlled Senate. Can It Continue Into 2011? \"I hope that everybody takes from this that it's possible for Democrats and Republicans to have principled disagreements -- to have some lengthy arguments -- but to ultimately find common ground to move the country forward,\" he said. But the Congress he will face in January will be decidedly less Democratic, and less friendly to his agenda. Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell has repeatedly suggested that Obama will find victories scarce in advance of the 2012 re-election campaign. Obama's victories included passing tax cut and unemployment benefit extensions, repealing the military's ban on gay service members, and approving the nuclear weapons reduction treaty he negotiated with Russia. He also pointed to bipartisan efforts that led to passage of a significant food safety law, and the nearly complete work on a measure that would provide health benefits to Sept. 11 first responders and other rescue workers who developed ailments as a result of exposure to toxic debris at the attack sites. Shoring Up Support All of the initiatives required Republican support in the Senate to overcome filibuster threats. And at least one, the extension of Bush-era tax cuts that including breaks for the wealthy, infuriated his base, which he acknowledged. However, polls show that in these final weeks of the lame-duck session, Obama has shored up support among moderates and independents -- and even some more liberal-minded Republicans, according to Gallup. Yet the president said the closing days of the 111th Congress served up disappointments, too. He noted in particular that the Senate declined to pass a measure known as the DREAM Act, which would have provided the children of illegal immigrants a path to citizenship through college or the military. \"Classmates of our children,\" he said, are cast in a \"shadow of fear through no fault of their own.\" \"And it is heartbreaking,\" Obama said, speaking with a passion he doesn't often show. \"They didn't break a law. They were kids.\" 'Determined' On 'Immigration Reform' The DREAM Act in recent days fell five votes short of the 60 needed to overcome a threatened GOP filibuster in the Senate. Some Republican senators, including Orrin Hatch of Utah, an original co-sponsor of the legislation, turned against the measure in a climate increasingly unfriendly to issues relating to illegal immigrants. \"I am determined and this administration is determined to get immigration reform done,\" Obama said. His comments came in response to a question about how he can keep that reform promise with Republican leaders insisting that the nation's borders must be secured before other reforms are contemplated. Obama defended his administration's actions on the border, and against employers who hire illegal workers, as more aggressive than \"any administration in recent years.\" We are, he said, \"a nation of laws and a nation of immigrants. So I'm going to go back at it.\" From 'Don't Ask, Don't Tell' To Gay Marriage? When pressed on whether he'd now advocate for same-sex marriage, given the military's repeal of its ban on gay service members, the president danced a bit. He cited \"friends\" and \"people who work for me\" as examples of \"powerful, strong, long-lasting gay or lesbian unions.\" But his \"baseline,\" he said, remains civil union laws that provide same-sex couples the protections and legal rights they would get as a married couple. \"This is an issue that extends to all of our society, and I think we're all going to have a conversation about it,\" he said. No Answers On Guantanamo Bay The president responded cautiously to a question about fulfilling his campaign promise to close the prison at Guantanamo Bay, which holds many who were captured as suspected terrorists or enemies of the U.S., then harshly interrogated outside of typical civil law enforcement procedures. He conceded that his administration faces challenges in deciding what to do with prisoners who would do the nation harm but who have been subject to tactics that make a case difficult to argue in federal or military courts. \"How do we manage that\" while living up to constitutional principles? he asked. It's a puzzle his administration has not yet figured out. But the president defended his administration's efforts in going after al-Qaida. \"They've hunkered down,\" he said, and have faced reduced financial and operation capacity. And with that, the president -- seemingly a much different president from the one who faced the American people the morning after his party's midterm drubbing -- left for a 10-day vacation in Hawaii with his family. He's not naive, he said, and doesn't expect all will go so well come January. Republican leaders have promised as much. But, for Obama, a hearty serving of lame duck turned things around for his administration -- at least for the holidays.",

It's hard to say who had the better December, the University of Connecticut women's basketball team or President Obama and the lame-duck Democratic-controlled Congress. If you had to choose, though, it'd probably be Obama and the congressional Democrats. The UConn women clearly have the edge over just about all their rivals. By contrast, the conventional wisdom in Washington was that Obama and the congressional Democrats would be lucky to limp into the new year after the mid-term elections, with emboldened congressional Republicans hobbling them until the Christmas break. In his Wednesday news conference, Obama acknowledged as much. OBAMA: A lot of folks predicted a season of more partisanship and gridlock. Instead it's been a season of productivity for the American people... ... So I think it's fair to say that this has been the most productive post-election period we've had in decades. \u00a0And it comes on the heels of the most productive two years that we've had in generations.... ... If there's any lesson to learn from the past few weeks is that we're not doomed to endless gridlock. On the Wednesday before Christmas, the president was able to point to an impressive number of initiatives that had seemed unlikely to get past the Republican opposition. In the morning, he signed the repeal of the \"Don't Ask, Don't Tell,\" ban on gays serving openly in the military. In the afternoon he saw the Senate ratify his top foreign policy priority, the New START nuclear arms control treaty with Russia, in a huge, bipartisan 71 to 26 vote, significantly better than the two-thirds vote needed. As if that weren't enough good news in one day for the president and his fellow Democrats, the Senate broke the logjam on another Democratic bill that had gotten bogged down, legislation to fund extended health care for Sept. 11 first responders. The House quickly followed suit on that measure. All of this came a few weeks after the first major victory following the mid-term elections, the passage of an extension of the Bush tax cuts -- coupled with economic stimulus -- an extension of jobless benefits for the long-term unemployed and the a reduction in the Social Security payroll tax paid by U.S. workers. True, Obama didn't get the DREAM act, which would have given some young illegal immigrants a path to citizenship. But Obama indicated he plans on returning to that legislation next year. And it sounds like he intends to put Republicans on the defensive by framing it as an issue of fundamental decency. Of course, it doesn't hurt that Hispanics are an increasingly important voting demographic likely to find Obama's stance on the DREAM Act more amenable than the legislation's Republican opponents. Far from being a broken party, the Democrats appeared to legislate with an energy that suggested they intended to use every remaining hour of their dwindling time controlling both chambers of Congress to legislate considering that in just a few weeks Republicans would control the House agenda. That suggests 2011 is likely to be a more challenging year for Obama as he will find a Tea Party-flavored, Republican House that will likely make him long for the days when House liberals accused him of repeatedly throwing them under the bus. Meanwhile, the Senate will be more Republican, increasing the hostility in that chamber, too. But while Obama will be challenged, so will congressional Republicans. If legislation grinds to a halt with the change in the House majority, Republicans could find themselves catching a lot of the blame. Obama has already proven he's willing to deal with his Republican opposition. He has made compromise his watchword. All he has to do is point to the productivity of the lame-duck session and the bipartisan success then. If that bipartisanship collapses going into 2011, and if Obama can plausibly point to the new Republican-controlled House as the reason, many voters may be prepared to accept his argument. So the lame-duck session has arguably given Obama a significantly stronger hand going into the new year than most people would've guessed on Election Day 2010. For Obama, Christmas came early.",

Hailing the ratification of the New START missile agreement with Russia, the repeal of the military's \"don't ask, don't tell\" policy, the passage of a tax cut and unemployment insurance package, and other accomplishments, Obama declared that they prove \"we are not doomed to endless gridlock.\" We \"live-blogged\" during the news conference. Scroll down to see how it played out. Update at 4:50 p.m. ET: The president is asked about another piece of unfinished business -- his pledge to close the U.S. detention center at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. \"My number one priority is keeping the American people safe,\" he begins. And one way to keep Americans safe is to not provide \"al-Qaida and jihadists (with) recruiting tools for fledgling terrorists.\" Guantanamo, he says, is \"probably the number one recruiting tool\" for terrorists around the world. But, he continues, the U.S. can't \"simply\" release people \"who could do us great harm.\" He's aiming, Obama says, to strike a balance between security and the values embedded in the Constitution. And that was the last question. Update at 4:45 p.m. ET: Staying on the subject of immigration, the president says that he hopes one thing Americans have seen during the lame-duck session of Congress is that \"I am persistent. If I believe in something strongly, I stay on it.\" Update at 4:44 p.m. ET: Obama is asked about his promise to reform immigration -- one that that hasn't been accomplished. One of his biggest regrets, Obama says, is that the DREAM Act (which would put some young people on the path to citizenship) hasn't been passed. \"That can't be who we are,\" Obama says of denying a path to citizenship for young people who came to the U.S. \"through no fault of their own\" and want to serve the nation. \"My administration is determined to get immigration reform done,\" the president adds. Of Republicans, he says, \"some of them in their heart of hearts know it (the DREAM Act) is the right thing to do.\" Update at 4:35 p.m. ET: Though he struck a deal with Republicans to extend tax cuts for the nation's wealthiest people as well as everyone else, Obama says he still believes it's not wise to give the super-rich such advantages when budget deficits are soaring. \"They will still be rich if those tax cuts went away,\" he says. Update at 4:32 p.m. ET: During this year's campaign, Obama often said that Republicans' ideas would put the economy into \"reverse.\" He's asked about where things stand now and his relations with the GOP. \"We are past the crisis point\" in the economy, he begins. \"But we now have to pivot\" to focus on creating jobs. It's the American people, he adds, who will \"drive\" the car and determine which party's policies are really working. And, says Obama, he thinks newly empowered Republicans realize that \"with greater power comes greater responsibility.\" Update at 4:29 p.m. ET: Is it inconsistent to support repeal of \"don't ask, don't tell\" and oppose allowing gay couples to marry, the president is asked. \"My feelings about this are constantly evolving. I struggle with this,\" Obama says. \"My baseline is a strong civil union\" that provides gays with protections and rights. \"But I recognize from their perspective that this is not enough.\" He will \"continue to wrestle\" with the issue. Update at 4:24 p.m. ET: Is he the new \"comeback kid,\" Obama is asked. The things that have gotten done in recent weeks (tax cuts, New START, repealing \"don't ask, don't tell\") were \"not a victory for me, it's a victory for the American people,\" the president says. Update at 4:23 p.m. ET: The accomplishments in Washington the past few weeks, Obama says, prove \"we are not doomed to endless gridlock.\" Update at 4:20 p.m. ET: Continuing his opening remarks, the president hails the \"package of tax cuts\" and unemployment insurance, the repeal of \"don't ask, don't tell,\" and the passage of new food safety regulations. He calls on the House to follow the Senate's lead and pass legislation to help 9/11 first responders pay their health care costs. The lame-duck session of Congress, Obama says, has been \"the most productive post-election period we've had in decades.\" Update at 4:19 p.m. ET: The New START missile reduction pact with Russia, Obama says, enhances the United States' standing in the world on the issue of nuclear proliferation. Update at 4:17 p.m. ET: The president just came to the podium. \"I just wanted to say a few words about the progress we've made on some key issues,\" he starts. \"It has been a season of progress for the American people.\" Update at 4:13 p.m. ET: The White House just tweeted that the news conference will look \"back at lame duck, ahead to future.\" Update at 4:11 p.m. ET: Though we hope you follow along with us, there are obviously many ways to monitor the news conference, including the White House's webcast. Update at 4:09 p.m. ET: On the air, NPR's David Welna just noted that 13 Republican senators today joined all the Democrats in the chamber to approve the New START missile reduction treaty with Russia -- an unusually bipartisan tally. Update at 4:01 p.m. ET: NPR's coverage is streaming. If you click on \"LISTEN NOW\" a player should pop up. At this moment, you'll hear the top-of-the-hour newscast. In a few minutes, NPR's Paul Brown will be on to host the pre- and post-news conference analyses. Our original post: President Obama is ending a busy day in Washington with a news conference at the Eisenhower Executive Office Building next to the White House. It's scheduled to get going at 4:15 p.m. ET. This morning, he signed legislation to repeal the \"don't ask, don't tell\" policy that has barred openly gay men and women from serving in the military. This afternoon, he saw the Senate ratify the New START missile reduction agreement with Russia. Last Friday, Obama signed into law the tax deal he reached with Congressional Republicans.

Pedro Ramirez, 22, was a toddler when his parents brought him to this country. It wasn\u2019t until his junior year in high school that he learned they had brought him here illegally. That news disrupted his plans to enlist in the service. \"That was my first choice,\" Ramirez said. \"To serve in some branch of the military, a lot of my friends were doing it, so I was hoping to join them.\" The DREAM Act would have opened the possibility of citizenship to young people who were brought to the U.S. before the age of 16. They would be required to go to college or join the military and stay out of trouble as a condition for getting legal residency. But the bill was defeated Five Senate Democrats from swing states joined a majority of Republicans in preventing a floor vote. \"The Republicans filibustered it pretty much, but I also blame the Democratic party for not getting all its members in line,\" Ramirez said. \"All we can do now, is prepare for the next Congress and keep pushing it. And prepare for 2012 when election season comes around and those Senators that voted against it, we'll keep them accountable.\" Opponents of the DREAM Act praised the Senate and said it now can move on to more important immigration matters. Ira Mehlman is a spokeman for the Federation For American Immigration Reform. \"The Senate recognized that amnesty for illegal aliens is not popular with the American public,\" Mehlman said. \"What the public really wants is for them to address the economic issues. That they will honor previous commitments to secure borders to really deal with the causes of illegal immigration rather than simply rewarding people who break our laws.\" In the aftermath of the vote, Latino activists say they are bruised but not beaten. They can still show majority support in the House and Senate, says Thomas Saenz President of the Mexican American Legal Defense and Educational Fund. \"A bill that has that kind of momentum will not go away,\" Saenz said. \"Even if a minority of the United States Senate failed to see that, it's an idea whose time has come and it will stick around until it is encated.\"",

Today, 18 years later, the U.S. Senate has completed work on a bill by which gays and lesbians will soon be able to serve openly in all branches of the U.S. armed forces. So the standing of gays in the military becomes the latest issue on which the agenda and fate of the last two Democratic presidents seem to be inextricably linked. As with the health care bill earlier this year, it would be fitting for the former president to be present at the signing ceremony, which should take place next week. We have come to refer to this particular milestone in American social history as the repeal of the \"don't ask, don't tell\" policy. It may be a curiously inverted term for the debate, but it harks back to the last time the issue consumed Washington and tells us a lot about how change happens. Clinton's Compromise Back in 1992, Clinton had promised several prominent backers he would overturn the longstanding military prohibition on homosexuality, and he tried to deliver on that promise immediately. He thought Congress and the country would go along because he had spoken of changing the policy in his campaign. He was wrong. Resistance arose immediately within the military and among social conservatives, and Clinton soon found many in his own party deserting him in Congress. He was forced to fall back on a compromise. The compromise had two parts. First, the military would stop trying to discover and discharge gays and lesbians. Second, those who let their orientation be known would still be subject to dismissal. The policy was called \"don't ask, don't tell.\" It pleased no one, but it let everyone move on. That is, after all, the essential function of a compromise. Congress codified it in 1993. A Change That Wouldn't Come Quickly Over the years, the policy, sometimes shorthanded as \"DADT,\" made no new friends. Those who wanted homosexuality banned in the services rankled at the DADT restraints, while the gay community saw the enforced concealment as inherently shaming and discriminatory. More than 13,500 active service members have been discharged under the provisions of this law. But beyond that, it has come to represent the persistence of gay closeting in the culture writ large. What had begun as an effort to change attitudes became a symbol of the difficulty in doing just that. Clinton had thought he could make the break by imitating President Harry Truman, who had stunned much of the country in 1948 by ordering an end to racial segregation in the armed forces. Truman did it by fiat, simply ordering the military to integrate \"as quickly as possible.\" Officially, the Pentagon saluted and complied. In reality, the process was labored and took years. Still, Clinton thought the Truman model would work for him. He reasoned that the existence of gays and lesbians in the ranks was an open secret in the military and in the society in general. He thought he was not so much altering a reality as repealing a hypocrisy. But that sort of thing can get a president in trouble, too. Saturday's vote will be called a victory for President Obama, and indeed he can take great satisfaction in completing the policy change Clinton set in motion almost a generation ago. The climate for this issue has warmed considerably in the interim, thanks to a long campaign by gay activists and civil rights groups and by moderating attitudes in the public and within the uniformed services -- as measured in recent surveys. DREAM Defeated But as change continues, resistance to it also persists. That is the lesson of the national elections of 2008 and 2010. And it was the lesson of the Senate votes taken this Saturday morning. On the same day the Senate took a step toward repealing DADT, it failed to break another filibuster threat against the DREAM Act. This is a bill allowing the children of people who entered the U.S. illegally to earn citizenship if they go to college or serve in military. The DREAM Act was at one time a bipartisan measure, and indeed it has attracted a smattering of GOP support thist time around. But in the Senate it had a majority of only 55, so it was hostage to the same tactical game by which the minority party maintains much of the power to run the Senate -- the \"virtual filibuster\" that requires 60 votes to do anything. It took nearly a generation to muster this many votes for gays in the military. How long will it take to find that many for the next meaningful change in the immigration laws?",

Harry Reid, the\u00a0Senate Majority Leader, said he learned he wouldn't get support from a number of Republicans who had earlier indicated they might back the bill. Reid, from Nevada, said nine Republican senators told him they would support the bill but \"walked away\" from the legislation. He didn't identify them but said: \"They know who they are.\" The failure to hold on to the Republicans means Reid won't have the votes to get past Republican opposition. Reid said he would work with the Sen. Mitch McConnell, a Kentucky Republican, to compose a continuing resolution that would keep the government funded for a few months. The federal government has been operating under continuing resolutions since Oct. 1 when fiscal 2011 started. The 1,924-page spending bill was criticized by Republicans as containing too \u00a0much spending and too many earmarks -- or as Reid called them, congressionally directed spending. Senate Republicans have sworn off earmarks because of the hostility from conservatives, including those in the Tea Party movement, to lawmakers requesting such funding for individual projects. Republicans took the midterm elections as the latest and strongest in a series of signals that such earmarks were anathema to many of their voters. Republicans also decided it would be better for them to wait until January when the House will come under Republican control and their party would also increase their numbers in the Senate. That would give them more leverage to force spending cuts they didn't have the power to make in the current Congress. With the spending bill shelved, Reid said he planned to next bring up for Senate consideration the DREAM Act, legislation that would put on a citizenship path young illegal immigrants who meet certain conditions, including college attendance or military service. After that, he plans to bring up repeal of Don't Ask, Don't Tell, the law that bans gays and lesbians from serving openly in the military.",

            "article_content": "President Obama shakes hands with House Republican Leader John Boehner (R-OH). The president has recently announced a tentative deal on taxes reached with Congressional Republicans.\n                \n                    \n                    Mark Wilson/Getty Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption Ari Berman is a contributing writer for The Nation magazine and an Investigative Journalism Fellow at The Nation Institute. During the 2008 presidential campaign, Barack Obama said over and over that he was running to \"put an end to the Bush-McCain philosophy.\" Campaigning in Colorado just days before the election, Obama clearly stated his opposition to Bush-era economic policies and ridiculed the idea that \"we should give more and more to millionaires and billionaires and hope that it trickles down on everybody else. It's a philosophy that gives tax breaks to wealthy CEOs and to corporations that ship jobs overseas while hundreds of thousands of jobs are disappearing here at home.\" Now Obama, in a blatant reversal, is preparing to do just that, agreeing to extend the Bush tax cuts for the wealthy, which my colleague Chris Hayes accurately calls the \"single defining domestic policy of W.\" In 2008, Obama presented himself as a clean break from the Bush and Clinton dynasties and a fresh face for the nation and the world. Yet once in office he packed his White House with holdovers from the Bush and Clinton administrations and continued or even accelerated key Bush-era policies, whether in the realm of counterterrorism, Afghanistan or offshore drilling. The latest \"compromise\" on the Bush tax cuts, extending the upper-income tax cuts for two years in exchange for the continuation of unemployment benefits, is simply the latest in a series of capitulations from the Obama White House. Read A Different Opinion Of The New Tax Deal Obama and Congressional Democrats bungled the tax debate from the start, even though it was clearly a winning issue for the president and his party. Even though everyone knew the Bush tax cuts were set to expire at the end of this year, Democrats failed to develop an overall strategy for this issue last summer or force a vote in the Congress before the election -- at a time when even Republicans like John Boehner said they'd vote to extend only the middle-class tax cuts if that was their only option. Yet Democrats refused to put the GOP on the spot or talk about the tax cuts during the campaign, blurring what should have been a core distinction between the parties; Democrats for the middle class, Republicans for the rich. As former Ohio Governor Ted Strickland said recently: \"If we can't win that argument we might as well just fold up.\" Once Democrats finally decided to vote on only the middle-class tax cuts, last week, Republicans had all the momentum and the issue had become mere political theater. Even as Congress was voting on the Democrats' plan, Obama signaled to Republicans that a more favorable deal was just around the corner, giving the GOP no incentive to side with Democrats. The Obama administration's posture on the tax cuts is eerily similar to its stance on the public option during healthcare reform -- the president says he wants the policy, but does absolutely nothing to fight for it, either through his own bully pulpit or on Capitol Hill. Last week, Organizing for America asked Obama supporters to phone bank in support of the DREAM Act, repealing \"don't ask, don't tell,\" and a pay freeze for federal workers (yet another concession to the GOP), but did nothing on the tax front. So now Obama is planning to spend $60 billion a year on tax cuts for millionaires and billionaires rather than, for example, a national infrastructure plan that would rebuild America and put people back to work. It's hard to see how the president will benefit either politically or substantively from this latest reversal of policy -- caving on the tax cuts will only embolden GOP leaders, who already see Obama as weak and unprincipled, and will further deflate restless Democratic activists and Obama supporters. If this is how Obama plans to govern in the future, we're in for a rough next two years. UPDATE: Five major progressive groups--MoveOn, Democracy for America, TrueMajority, Credo Action and the Progressive Campaign Change Committee--are now urging the Senate not to ratify the imminent Obama deal. Says DFA chair Jim Dean: \"Voters - and activists - are not buying the notion that tax cuts for high income earners are the only path to extending the middle class tax-cuts. As for any Democratic members of Congress who are going along with extending the tax cuts for high income earners -- this is the stuff that primaries are made of.\"",

            "article_content": "A statue of George Washington stands in the Capitol Rotunda on Capitol Hill. Congress returns Monday for a hectic lame-duck session.\n                \n                    \n                    Alex Brandon/AP\n                    \n                \nhide caption Congress returns Monday for a lame-duck session that will provide Democrats their final taste of Capitol Hill dominance before Republicans take over the House and expand their Senate minority caucus in January. But with the controlling party limping back after an Election Day thrashing, it remains unclear whether Democrats will decide to close out the final four weeks or so of the 111th Congress with a bang or a whimper. \"There is so much uncertainty going on,\" says Sam Rosen-Amy of the nonprofit OMB Watch, which tracks federal budget policy and spending. \"I have no idea what might happen.\" The uncertainty is especially strong with Republicans suggesting they'll block any measure lacking a strong consensus and Democrats in a quandary over their leadership and tone going forward. The Fate Of 'Don't Ask, Don't Tell' What is guaranteed: Congress will have to quickly decide what to do about Bush-era tax cuts scheduled to expire at the end of the year. Members must also deal with a dozen current-year spending bills that they have yet to pass more than a month into the 2011 fiscal year. What is far less clear is whether Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, other Senate Democrats and the White House will go to the mat on issues that include a high-profile measure that would end the \"don't ask, don't tell\" ban on openly gay Americans serving in the military. \"Clearly the president and his staff realize that if we don't get don't ask, don't tell repealed now, it will be a very long time before we have the opportunity again,\" says Aubrey Sarvis, an Army veteran and head of the pro-repeal Servicemembers Legal Defense Network. The issue took on new relevancy this week when a leaked Pentagon study due to President Obama on Dec. 1 suggested that there would be little risk in repealing the measure, which Congress passed in 1993. The Supreme Court on Friday declined a Republican gay rights group's request to stop enforcement of the ban while a lower court reviews its constitutionality. Latino activists are also watching to see whether the freshly re-elected Reid will make good on his win-or-lose campaign promise to pursue a measure that gives children of illegal immigrants a path to citizenship through education and military service. And other pending measures also hang, but barely, in the lame-duck balance -- including one that would set renewable electricity standards and another that would provide new bargaining rights to police and firefighters. All hinge on the question of whether Democrats return to Capitol Hill on Monday defeated or defiant. The Bush-Era Tax Cuts The brief session is expected to be dominated by debate over the fate of the Bush tax cuts of 2001 and 2003, which disproportionately benefited higher income taxpayers. Democrats have argued that the cuts, which expire at the end of the year, should be extended only to families earning less than $250,000. Resurgent Republicans, who will take over the House under presumptive Speaker John Boehner, want all the cuts made permanent -- at a cost that OMB Watch has estimated at more than $5 trillion, including debt serving and related costs,\u00a0over the next decade. Republicans have yet to put forth a plan to pay for the high-income tax cut extension. The tax-cut prospects became increasingly muddied in recent days by competing accounts of where Obama stands on the issue. The White House, which has opposed extending the cuts to people who earn more than $250,000, has attempted to beat back a report in the Huffington Post that quoted top Obama adviser David Axelrod as suggesting that the president had stepped back from that position. \"We're willing to discuss how we move forward,\" Axelrod later said in an e-mail to the National Journal, \"but we believe that it's imperative to extend the tax cuts for the middle class, and don't believe we can afford a permanent extension of tax cuts for the wealthy.\" The coming debate has also been complicated in recent days by deep cuts proposed by the heads of Obama's bipartisan deficit commission. \"The new report,\" says Rosen-Amy, the OMBWatch federal fiscal policy analyst, \"is going to retrench partisans on both sides.\" Control Of Spending The nation's fiscal year began in October, but the government is currently operating under a congressional resolution that continues funding of the past year while a dozen spending bills have yet to be passed. That resolution that essentially keeps government open expires Dec. 3, leaving Congress with a choice: either approve the 12 spending bills in one big package, or pass another resolution that allows the government to continue operating under 2010 budget levels until sometime after the new Congress convenes. The latter would give Republicans, who take over the\u00a0House in\u00a0January,\u00a0more control over the spending for the remainder of the fiscal year -- a scenario many conservatives prefer. Path To Citizenship Just A 'DREAM'? In his tough re-election campaign in Nevada, Reid relied on Latino voters for his edge over Republican Sharron Angle, a Tea Party favorite. One of his promises was to raise the so-called \"DREAM Act\" legislation during the lame-duck session. Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid enlisted the support of\u00a0 boxer Manny Pacquiao to court Latino voters.\n                \n                    \n                    Isaac Brekken/AP\n                    \n                \nhide caption The bipartisan measure makes children of illegal immigrants eligible for a six-year path to citizenship that hinges on the completion of a college degree or two years of military service. Democrats had tried to attach it to the Defense Department spending bill earlier this year. \"Here's what we know: Reid promised in a very clear way that he would bring this up, win or lose,\" says Angela Kelley, vice president for immigration policy and advocacy at the liberal Center for American Progress. \"Reid still has a job as Senate majority leader in no small part because of the high, high turnout of Latino voters in Nevada,\" she says. If the measure doesn't make it into the defense bill -- GOP Sen. John McCain of Arizona and others oppose its inclusion -- and Reid fails to raise it on the Senate floor, Kelley says, \"it will not go unnoticed by the Latino community.\" Race To The Finish Whatever the agenda, it will be a race to the finish with enormous economic stakes. Or, as Rosen-Amy puts it: \"The result could be a hectic lame-duck session with trillions of dollars in spending on the table.\" And that has the potential to produce, he says, \"legislation motivated by political expediency\u00a0rather\u00a0than sound fiscal policy.\"",

A spokesman for McConnell has said that the GOP remains \"on guard\" for Democratic maneuvers during the lame duck session.\n                \n                    \n                    Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption Robert Costa is a political reporter for National Review. He covers the White House, Congress, and campaigns.  As Senate GOP leaders look ahead to the lame-duck session, many are cautiously optimistic about their chances of thwarting any big-ticket spending initiatives. In fact, with a limited calendar and potential Democratic losses on the horizon, some Republicans wonder whether the latter will even come up for debate. In an interview with National Review Online, Don Stewart, the communications director for Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell (KY), says that Republicans \"are preparing and remain on guard\" for Democratic maneuvers. Still, he says, \"With a whole new crop of Democrats, including the president, immediately facing the 2012 cycle after Election Day, there may not be a lot of momentum on their side to make controversial votes.\" Some Democrats may choose to stay home. \"Typically in lame-duck sessions, people aren't in a great mood, especially if they've just had a bad day,\" Stewart observes. \"So some of them may not even show up -- there is potential for a few complete absences. Would you want to come up here for some ugly, hard vote after you'd lost or retired?\" On the other side of the aisle, Republicans are hoping to bolster their ranks immediately. Three Democratic appointees -- Sen. Roland Burris (IL), Sen. Carte Goodwin (WV), and Sen. Ted Kaufman (DE) -- will relinquish their seats following the midterms. With potential pickups emerging from those races, \"We could have three new members right away, if we have a really good day,\" Stewart says. \"That doesn't get us to 50, of course, but it takes them farther away from 60 and would give us a little more leverage, which leads us to think that they won't spend a lot of time on big, controversial things.\" (In the Senate, a party needs 60 votes to overcome a filibuster.) In recent months, the lame-duck session, which is slated to begin on Nov. 15, has been the subject of much debate on Capitol Hill. Various Senate Democrats have voiced their support for pursuing hot-button legislation, from the DREAM Act, which deals with the immigration status of illegal residents, to the repeal of the military's \"Don't Ask, Don't Tell\" policy, which is included in the defense-authorization bill. A climate bill has also been rumored, but with Gov. Joe Manchin, the Democrats' Senate nominee in West Virginia, literally shooting one in his new campaign spot, the likelihood of one in the lame duck is close to nil. The November session will be brief, just a few days before the Senate recesses for Thanksgiving. Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid (NV) has arranged for a debate on a vote on the Food Safety Modernization Act, which Stewart predicts will not cause much of a fuss. Due to debate constraints, little more will be on the legislative agenda next month. Come December, things may heat up. Stewart tells us that Republicans will be focused on finding a way to extend the Bush tax cuts, which are set to expire at the end of this year. Stewart says that the GOP is open to working with Democrats on this, and that party leaders want to find a way to keep current law in place. Republicans would also like to see a freeze on appropriations and spending kept to at least $300 billion below the president's current budget proposal, all while eyeing more ways to slice largesse from the federal budget. Republicans will also make sure to fight any potential tax hikes. On that front, McConnell, who does not see increased taxes as the answer to the deficit, is waiting to review what the bipartisan Deficit Reduction Commission recommends. The debate over the commission's report \"could take up a lot of time,\" Stewart says. \"Most Republicans are disinclined to go for any more taxes. We would like to do something real on entitlement reform,\" but he is unsure about whether Democrats have any serious interest. For conservatives who remain worried about Democratic shenanigans in the lame duck, Stewart offers a parting thought: \"Remember, if they can't pass it now, they sure as heck won't be able to pass it then. . . . I don't want to dampen enthusiasm, but when you look at the political reality, they may get aggressive, but they hopefully just won't have the votes to do much damage.\"",

            "article_content": "Before heading to Hawaii for the holidays, President Obama signed a law to allow gays and lesbians to serve openly in the military, and won ratification of the new START Treaty. The president's last planned news conference of the year was delivered with a victorious tone.  LINDA WERTHEIMER, Host: It's MORNING EDITION from NPR News. Good morning. I'm Linda Wertheimer. STEVE INSKEEP, Host: And I'm Steve Inskeep. Having won passage of bill after bill, President Obama is in Hawaii this morning. He took the trip after an unexpectedly busy period in Washington. WERTHEIMER: Even though his party was crushed in midterm elections, the White House claimed many victories in the lame-duck session of Congress. INSKEEP: Part of the reason was the Democrats still had their big majorities. WERTHEIMER: And part of the reason was that key Republicans joined the Democrats. INSKEEP: We begin our coverage with NPR's Ari Shapiro. ARI SHAPIRO: The last time the president held a news conference was just three weeks ago, and he seemed like a different person. Back then he had just rolled out a tax deal and the liberal base was in revolt. At that podium, Mr. Obama seemed bristly and defensive. Last night he was relaxed and clearly relishing his victories. BARACK OBAMA: A lot of folks in this town predicted that after the midterm elections, Washington would be headed for more partisanship and more gridlock. And instead this has been a season of progress for the American people. SHAPIRO: Minutes earlier, more than two-thirds of the Senate had passed the president's top national security priority - an arms treaty with Russia. Just that morning, President Obama fulfilled a campaign promise by signing into law the repeal of don't ask, don't tell. And there were many other legislative victories besides: a tax cut agreement, a food safety law, a child nutrition bill, health benefits for 9/11 first responders, and more. OBAMA: So I think it's fair to say that this has been the most productive post-election period we've had in decades, and it comes on the heels of the most productive two years that we've had in generations. SHAPIRO: Mr. Obama framed the turbo-charged lame-duck session as a fulfillment of his often repeated promise of bipartisanship. His message was: Despite what the naysayers will tell you, the goal of rising above petty politics is, in fact, achievable. OBAMA: If there's any lesson to draw from these past few weeks, it's that we are not doomed to endless gridlock. We've shown in the wake of the November elections that we have the capacity not only to make progress, but to make progress together. SHAPIRO: There was some gridlock, though. The President said his greatest disappointment in the lame-duck session was that the DREAM Act failed to overcome a Republican filibuster. That bill would have provided a path to citizenship to students or service members who were brought to the country illegally as young children. Mr. Obama said he gets letters from kids who would be covered by the bill. OBAMA: I'm willing to serve my country, I'm willing to fight for this country, I want to go to college and better myself, and I'm at risk of deportation. And it is heartbreaking. That can't be who we are. SHAPIRO: The president promised to re-introduce the DREAM Act next year. And he said he'll fight for a broader immigration overhaul too. It's not clear how he plans to get a more ambitious plan through a Congress where Republicans are stronger than they were this year. But he said he's determined. OBAMA: One thing I hope people have seen during this lame duck, I am persistent. SHAPIRO: And he cribbed a line from Spider-Man to talk about why he thinks Republicans may be more eager to cross the aisle next year than they were for the last two years. OBAMA: My sense is the Republicans recognize that with greater power is going to come greater responsibility. And some of the progress that I think we saw in the lame duck was a recognition on their part that people are going to be paying attention to what they're doing as well as what I'm doing and what the Democrats in Congress are doing. SHAPIRO: The president also seemed to acknowledge that he has a responsibility to be less partisan. When a reporter asked whether Mr. Obama stands by his election-season refrain that Republicans are drinking a Slurpee while Democrats dig the economy out of a ditch, the president laughed, then he got serious. OBAMA: The American people are driving the car. They're the ones who are going to be making an assessment as to whether we're putting in place policies that are working for them. And both parties are going to be held accountable and I'm going to be held accountable if we take a wrong turn on that front. SHAPIRO: There are major fights ahead. President Obama wants to reform the tax code next year and overhaul the education system. The prison at Guantanamo Bay is still open, and more than a dozen of President Obama's judicial nominees are still being blocked in the Senate. But those fights can wait for the New Year. For now, the President plans to enjoy Hawaii. Ari Shapiro, NPR News, the White House. Copyright \u00a9 2010 NPR.  All rights reserved.

            "article_content": "Known as the \"father of American music,\" Stephen Foster made his living by selling his sheet music in the days before records and radio. During his career, Foster penned over 200 tunes, including the lyrics for \"Oh! Susanna,\" \"Jeanie with the Light Brown Hair,\" \"Camptown Races\" and \"My Old Kentucky Home.\" But many of Foster's musical lyrics often contained hateful racial ideas. Some of Foster's songs, like the ones written in black dialect to be performed in black face, are \"a source of racial embarrassment and infuriation,\" says Ken Emerson. Emerson, a music historian, is the author of a Foster biography,  Doo-dah!: Stephen Foster And The Rise Of American Popular Culture. He also edited a new compilation of lyrics penned by Foster and his contemporaries, entitled Stephen Foster & Co. In a 1997 interview with Terry Gross, Emerson explained Foster's importance to the history of popular song and also why his songs continue to resonate more than 150 years after he wrote them. \"I think that Stephen Foster really did create popular music as we still recognize it today, and he did it because he took together all these strands of the American experience,\" Emerson said. \"And he consciously or -- it was hard to talk about the degree of consciousness -- but he clearly, effectively merged [other ethnic genres] into a single music.  And I think he merged them in a way that appeals to the multicultural mongrel experience of America in its history and culture.\" Ken Emerson writes about intersection of music and culture. He also the author of Always Magic in the Air: The Bomp and Brilliance of the Brill Building Era.\n\n                    \n                    Courtesy Ken Emerson\n                    \n                \nhide caption Ken Emerson writes about intersection of music and culture. He also the author of Always Magic in the Air: The Bomp and Brilliance of the Brill Building Era. Emerson also points out that many of Foster's songs were more sophisticated than he had originally imagined. \"There's one song he wrote, for instance, [\"The Glendy Burk\"] which deliberately quotes two measures of Schubert and then quotes two measures of a Robert Burns Scottish ballad, so that you have sort of a Scottish [sound] and a German [sound] you know, spliced,\" Emerson explains. \"And that kind of wit and craft is something that people didn't realize Foster possessed when we used to think of him as sort of this naive folk poet with his finger on the pulse of the American soul, in a sort of a salt-of-the-earth way. He was a much more conscious writer who didn't just compose his songs. He contrived them.\" This interview was originally broadcast on June 17, 1997 Stephen Foster and the Rise of American Popular Culture by Ken Emerson Paperback, 400 pages | Your purchase helps support NPR programming.

After having cleared the House earlier in the week, the bill authorizing repeal passed the Senate in a resounding 65-to-31 vote.  It's now headed for President Obama's signature.  LIANE HANSEN, host: This is WEEKEND EDITION from NPR News. I'm Liane Hansen. The Senate's to-do list is packed for the final days of the not-so-lame-duck session of Congress. Ratification of the nuclear arms treaty with Russia is on today's agenda. Yesterday, the Senate voted on two big items: a bill that would have granted citizenship to some illegal immigrants, and a measure to roll back the policy that bars gays from serving openly in the military. As NPR's David Welna reports, don't ask, don't tell may soon be history. DAVID WELNA: It was a momentous day for those who fought to repeal don't ask, don't tell ever since Congress passed that law 17 years ago. After having cleared the House earlier this week, the bill authorizing the repeal passed the Senate in a resounding 65 to 31 vote. It's now headed for President Obama's signature. New York Democrat Kirsten Gillibrand said Congress was responding to what voters said they wanted. Senator KIRSTEN GILLIBRAND (Democrat, New York): The last election was very much about a statement by the American public saying that they want their public servants to come together to get the people's business done. And I can think of no more important piece of legislation than repealing this corrosive, unjust, discriminatory policy, one that entirely undermined our national security and our military readiness. WELNA: The Republican leading the opposition for a repeal said Democrats got the wrong message from the election. Arizona's John McCain said thousands of active duty and retired service members have urged him to fight any change in the policy banning gays from serving openly. Senator JOHN MCCAIN (Republican, Arizona): And they're saying, Senator McCain, it isn't broke and don't fix it. So, all of this talk about how it's a civil rights issue, equality, the fact is the military has the highest recruiting and highest retention than any time in its history. WELNA: But eight of McCain's fellow Republicans did conclude the policy was broken and voted with the Democrats to end don't ask, don't tell. One of them, Maine's Susan Collins, called the day historic. Senator SUSAN COLLINS (Republican, Maine): I want to thank all of the gay men and women that are fighting for us today in Afghanistan and in Iraq. We honor your service and now we can do so openly. WELNA: There was a word of caution, though, amid the celebration at the Capitol. Aubrey Sarvis, who heads the Servicemembers Legal Defense Network, warned that the certification process the bill requires to implement repeal could take a while. Mr. AUBREY SARVIS (Servicemembers Legal Defense Network): Repeal is not yet final. The president will sign this bill shortly. The certification process must go forward and the 60-day congressional period must go forward as well. WELNA: But while the repeal bill will soon become law, that's not the case for the so-called DREAM Act the Senate voted on yesterday. The measure would make a pathway to citizenship for college students and service members who were brought by their parents to the U.S. illegally as children. Dick Durbin, the Senate's number two Democrat, pleaded with colleagues to vote for it as an act of political courage. Senator DICK DURBIN (Democrat, Illinois): Many of you have told me that you're lying awake at night tossing and turning over this vote because you know how hard it's going to be politically. Some people have tried to use it against you. But I might say that if you can summon the courage to vote for the DREAM Act today, you will join ranks with senators before you who have come before this United States and made history with their courage, who stood up and said the cause of justice is worth the political risk. WELNA: Alabama Republican Jeff Sessions asserted the DREAM Act was nothing more than an amnesty for illegal intruders. Senator JEFF SESSIONS (Republican, Alabama): Here were are in the final days of a lame duck - some say dead duck - Congress considering a bill that would create a major problem to the effective enforcement of immigration laws. WELNA: In the end, the DREAM Act fell five votes shy of the 60 needed to move forward. David Welna, NPR News, the Capitol. Copyright \u00a9 2010 NPR.  All rights reserved.

            "article_content": "As Democrats try to line up 67 votes for the new START treaty, Republicans rail about being railroaded and complain about word-phrasing, details and amendments. Proponents of ratifying the treaty suspect the real reason GOP senators are balking is that they don't want to give President Obama a foreign policy victory and let the lame-duck session end in a wave of Democratic success.  AUDIE CORNISH, host: From NPR News, this is ALL THINGS CONSIDERED. I'm Audie Cornish. ROBERT SIEGEL, host: And I'm Robert Siegel. Before Congress gets a new start in January, Senate Democrats are racing to finish the nuclear weapons treaty with Russia that's known as new START. But Senate Republicans would rather take up the treaty next year, when their ranks will have grown. That's a problem for President Obama, whose top foreign policy goal for the lame-duck session is ratifying the treaty. NPR's David Welna reports. DAVID WELNA: Listening to White House spokesman Robert Gibbs today, it did not sound as if President Obama had any doubts about getting the nine GOP votes that may be needed if the Senate's to ratify the new START treaty by a two-thirds majority. Mr. ROBERT GIBBS (White House Spokesman): The White House believes that before Congress leaves town that the Senate will ratify the new START treaty. WELNA: That was not the impression you'd get listening to the debate on the Senate floor today. One day after Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell announced he would vote against the treaty, he portrayed the effort to get it ratified as nothing more than Democrats trying to chalk up another win for President Obama. Senator MITCH McCONNELL (Republican, Kentucky): Our top concern should be the safety and security of our nation, not some politician's desire to declare a political victory and host a press conference before the first of the year. Americans have had more than enough of artificial timelines set by politicians eager for attention. WELNA: McConnell's opposition was no surprise: He recently said his top priority was to prevent President Obama's re-election. Less expected was the decision also announced yesterday by the Senate's number two Republican to oppose the treaty. Arizona's Jon Kyl has acted as his party's point-man on the pact. Today, he derided Democrats for voting down GOP attempts to amend the treaty, which would likely kill it. Senator JON KYL (Republican, Arizona): The U.S. Senate has the last word according to our Constitution. We gave our advice. The administration didn't take our advice in two specific ways. But yet they expect us to give them their consent to the treaty. The reality is the Senate should not be a rubber stamp. WELNA: All this seemed to exasperate the treaty's main sponsor, Foreign Relations Committee chairman John Kerry. He said it was the Republicans who requested that new START not be considered earlier, on the grounds it could be politicized by the November election. Senator JOHN KERRY (Democrat, Massachusetts): In order to not politicize the treaty, we made a decision on our side to accommodate their interests. Having accommodated their interests, they now come back and turn around and say: Oh, you guys are terrible. You're bringing this treaty up at the last minute. I mean, is there no shame? WELNA: What's more, argued North Dakota Democrat Byron Dorgan, there is nearly unanimous bipartisan support among current and former top officials for ratifying the treaty. Senator BYRON DORGAN (Democrat, North Dakota): Every living secretary of State from the Republican and Democratic administrations have come out in favor of this treaty, everyone. The chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff has made a very assertive, strong statement in support of this treaty. WELNA: Still, some Republicans who once appeared receptive to ratifying the treaty are now backtracking. Here's South Carolina's Lindsey Graham earlier this month, saying the lame-duck session had to take care of extending tax cuts, extend unemployment benefits and fund the government. Senator LINDSEY GRAHAM (Republican, South Carolina): Get those core issues resolved. Then the thing that would make most sense to me to get resolved would be the START treaty. WELNA: But here's Graham yesterday on CBS's \"Face the Nation\" Sen. GRAHAM: If you really want to have a chance of passing START, you'd better start over and do it in the next Congress because this lame duck has been poisoned. WELNA: Poisoned, he said, by votes on other issues, such as repealing the ban on gays serving openly in the military. On Saturday, the date that vote was held, Majority Leader Harry Reid chastised Republicans for turning against new START because of those votes. Senator HARRY REID (Democrat, Nevada): They're going to vote against this international treaty dealing with nuclear weapons because they had to vote on the DREAM Act and \"don't ask, don't tell\"? Now, that's real statesmanship. WELNA: The debate's been going on for six days. A key vote to limit further debate on the treaty takes place tomorrow. David Welna, NPR News, the Capitol.

MulticulturalismGerman Chancellor Angela Merkel last week declared that Germany's approach to building a multicultural society where people live happily side by side has \"utterly failed.\" Merkel said that immigrants are welcome in Germany, but must learn the language and better assimilate into society. \"We feel tied to Christian values.\" she said, \"Those who don't accept them don't have a place here.\" While some argue that Merkel's statements were aimed at scoring points with conservatives, her comments reflect a rising tide of anti-immigrant language in Germany and other parts of Europe. In an op-ed in The Boston Globe, James Carroll says that on both sides of the Atlantic, a rising tide of xenophobic hostility toward immigrants is threatening to swamp the foundation of liberal democracy. Today, host Neal Conan talks about the debate over multiculturalism from both sides of the pond. Mini-JunkieHost Neal Conan and Political Junkie Ken Rudin are counting down the days to the 2010 midterm election. On a special early week mini-edition of the Political Junkie, Neal and Ken will check in with one of the hottest gubernatorial races in the country, and speak with Ohio Governor Ted Strickland and his Republican challenger, John Kasich. Teaching LanguageIn an age where Spanish and Mandarin Chinese could be the most useful languages in business, what's the point of learning French? As universities across the country slash budgets, one New York college cut French, Italian, Russian and other programs some would deem no longer useful. Linguist John McWhorter joins host Neal Conan to explain his belief that Not Everyone Needs French -- an opinion piece he wrote in the New York Times. And Anne McCall, dean of arts and humanities at the University of Denver, explains why languages are booming on her campus.",

            "article_content": "Sarah Palin speaks at a \"celebration of life\" fundraiser. Her brand of feminism is disturbing to many progressives.\n                \n                    \n                    Mark Wilson/Getty Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption Betsy Reed is the executive editor of The Nation. She co-edited The New York Times bestseller Going Rouge: Sarah Palin -- An American Nightmare. It's a horrifying thought: Is Sarah Palin progressives' fault? Could it be that we brought this on ourselves? Anna Holmes and Rebecca Traister think so. As they argued in their New York Times Op-Ed yesterday, \"If Sarah Palin and her acolytes successfully redefine what it means to be a groundbreaking political woman, it will be because progressives let it happen.\" By not doing enough to nurture their own women leaders, Holmes and Traister say, it was Dems who cleared the way for Palin and her raging pack of grizzlies to maul our politics. Progressives \"have done nothing to stop an anti-choice, pro-abstinence, socialist-bashing Tea Party enthusiast from becoming the 21st century symbol of American women in politics.\" Holmes and Traister have a point: Democrats don't do enough for women -- either as constituents, as we saw with the heartbreaking abortion healthcare compromise, or as candidates. Indeed, the Democrats' own wobbly commitment to promoting women hampered what should have been a slam-dunk response to the GOP's bogus \"Year of the Woman\" hype after the June elections. Yes, Dems could point out that only 8 of the Republicans' 110 Young Guns were female, but when reporters asked for their equivalent stats, they had to mumble apologetically about \"not being satisfied\" that just three of 13 members of Red to Blue, the party's program to support candidates in battleground districts, are women. But it's not as if more assiduous Democratic efforts to recruit and support female candidates would have satisfied the same \"appetite for female leadership\" that Palin does, thereby preempting her astonishing ascension. What Palin satisfies, rather, is an appetite for right-wing female leadership. And actually, notwithstanding their shortcomings, the Democrats can legitimately claim to have a much better record than Republicans in promoting and electing women. In today's Congress, women hold 90 seats, and of these just 21 are Republicans, versus 69 Democrats -- including, not insignificantly, the first female Speaker. In a sobering LA Times piece published the same day as Holmes and Traister's Op-Ed, Lisa Mascaro reported that the number of women in Washington may decline after this year's midterms, with as many as 10 seats held by women in danger of being washed away by a Republican wave, which would amount to \"the first backslide in the uninterrupted march of women to Washington since 1978.\" In other words, Mama Grizzlies can roar all they want, but years that are good for Republicans tend to be bad for women, and this year is likely to be no different. Holmes and Traister accuse the Democrats of favoring a \"diminutive\" model of female political behavior. They cite the reluctance of Democratic women like Nancy Pelosi to mount a \"Palin-style girl-power campaign\" as evidence. I'm all for girl power, but I'm not sure that would help Nancy Pelosi much right now, given the misogynist venom she has had to face from the right this election season merely for exercising her authority in a no-nonsense manner. (The title of a new right-wing hit book is telling: it's called She's the Boss: The Disturbing Truth About Nancy Pelosi. Nice how they spell it out like that: yes, female authority -- disturbing!) The more specific question of whether Democratic sexism in the primary opened the door to Palin in 2008 is an interesting one, which Traister explores in riveting detail in her nuanced feminist account of how that campaign unfolded, Big Girls Don't Cry: The Election That Changed Everything for American Women, coming out this September. Though the media obsessed at the time about the largely mythological PUMAs and their supposed readiness to ditch the Democrats, making the Palin pick initially appear to be a stroke of desperate genius by a flailing McCain, in reality the boys running his campaign were only dimly aware that Palin's gender would be an issue. Their vague hopes of snagging votes from disgruntled Clinton fans did not pan out -- women were smarter than they thought. But, after being sidelined by the male-dominated McCain campaign, vilified by the left and ridiculed by the media, Palin found a warm embrace among conservative women, who were thrilled to see one of their own enjoy a taste of power for a change. \"My experience with Palin's supporters left me alert to the fact that she was building an army of followers -- not just scared and angry xenophobes\u2026but women (and men) who felt that their support for this candidate was about an expansion of opportunities for women,\" Traister writes. So who's to blame for Palin? Of course, there's no simple, single answer. Perhaps we're all a bit guilty. I'd lay much of the responsibility on the media, for casting her as the Republican starlet and then treating her to a spectacular tabloid meltdown, for celebrating her beauty and earthy charm and then glorying in her every humiliation, and now blasting her every inane tweet into a vast and thought-killing echo chamber. But it's we media consumers who can't stop looking and listening.",
