The majority of states hold partisan elections for the person who also oversees the state's elections. The secretary of state, as the role is often called, is the chief election official and in most places that person is a Republican. As some Republican-led states have adopted strict voting laws, Democrats have made many of those races a priority this year. In Iowa, a state which leads the presidential nominating process, Democratic politicians flirting with a presidential run in 2020 are already jockeying to get on stage with Deidre DeJear, the Democratic nominee for secretary of state. The 32-year-old is a rising star and the first African-American nominated by a major party in Iowa. \"There is so much on the line and electing Deidre DeJear will be a statement about who we are as Americans,\" California Sen. Kamala Harris said to a cheering crowd of Democrats last week in Des Moines. DeJear is a small-business owner and worked on former President Barack Obama's campaign. She's running to unseat Republican Secretary of State Paul Pate who is phasing in a new voter ID law. This year, Iowa voters without IDs will be allowed to sign an oath of identification attesting they are who they say they are. There are competitive races for governor and at least two Republican held U-S House seats on the ballot. Democratic Sen.

Kamala Harris in Iowa supporting the campaign of Deidre DeJear, candidate for state secretary of state. DeJear says, when it comes to voting, she wants to \"make it welcoming and strip away the partisanship so people feel inclined to vote, and they also understand the value added when they do participate.\" She says she's not running on overturning the state's voter ID law, but trying to increase turnout in all elections. \"Young people, racial minorities, people who have moved, these are people who are Democratic constituents for the most part,\" says Rick Hasen, a University of California-Irvine election law expert. \"These are the people whose strict registration or voter identification laws could end up discouraging or disenfranchising from voting in the election.\" \"Would you rather have someone from your team or the other team in charge?\" Hasen asks.\"My view is it should be someone from neither team, but that's now the situation is set up.\" Take Georgia for example. There, Republican Secretary of State, Brian Kemp, is running for governor. Former President and Georgia native Jimmy Carter has personally called on Kemp to resign his position overseeing the state's elections after months of accusations that his office is suppressing the vote. In Kansas, the secretary of state, Kris Kobach, recused himself from the close primary vote count against the state's incumbent governor. And in Iowa, while there is no proof of widespread voter fraud, Secretary of State Pate, 60, says showing an ID is like the key to your house. \"I'm sure everybody in the morning, when they leave their home, they lock their door,\" Pate told Iowa Public Radio's River to River recently. \"It doesn't mean someone's broke into your home, but you're protecting what you find is valuable. And that's what the ID component does.\" Pate regularly points to public opinion polls supporting voter ID in the state. Now, Pate's out with an ad where he's holding a football and dressed in a black and white stripe referee outfit. \"As Iowa's Secretary of State it's my job to be the referee,\" Pate says in the ad. \"Not to wear a team jersey. We're going to make sure your vote counts. Easy to vote and hard to cheat.\" \"If we really want to think about a sports analogy, you've got refs, you've got players and you also have a commissioner,\" Deidre DeJear says. \"His job is not to be the ref. Those are our auditor's jobs.\"",

A man listens as Black Voters Matter co-founder LaTosha Brown speaks at a church as part of The South Rising Tour, aimed at getting more voters to the polls. President Trump has prayed with evangelicals in the White House. He's nominated judges they like to federal courts, and granted their wish of moving the U.S. embassy to Jerusalem. For the president's evangelical supporters, he has been a godsend. And now he has a request for them: Get out the vote in November's midterm elections. But religious leaders on the left are also inspired to get their people to go the polls. In the heart of the Virginia Theological Seminary campus, a pub named after the year the flagship Episcopal seminary was established \u2014 1823 \u2014 recently hosted a get-out-the-vote event. The seminary registrar, Rachel Holm, was in the pub, driving home the importance of these midterms elections to the mostly 20- and 30-somethings in the crowd, and livening it up with a game of election trivia. \"So, what are the three topics millennial voters care about most when voting?\" she asked. \"Themselves, themselves, themselves!' one of them shouted, as the others erupted in laughter. Then, joking aside, Holm told them to make sure they understood the requirements for registering to vote in Virginia. Registering students from around the country to vote may be unlike Holm's day job of registering them for courses, in subjects such as \"Pastoral Care\" or \"Practical Theology.\" Because of the 2016 election, I think that a lot of people woke up and saw that the religious right is so organized and so behind this candidate and so maybe we don't agree with a lot of their positions. Rachel Holm, registrar, Virginia Theological Seminary But the leadership of this progressive seminary feels called in the Trump era to motivate young voters. \"Because of the 2016 election, I think that a lot of people woke up and saw that the religious right is so organized and so behind this candidate and so maybe we don't agree with a lot of their positions,\" Holm said. Evangelicals and Trump But conservative evangelicals are also rallying voters for the midterms. Two years ago, when President Trump was running for office and promising to favor conservative values, key evangelical leaders argued that his personal history should be overlooked. And many conservative voters seem to have done just that. According to exit polls, 81 percent of white evangelical Christians cast ballots for Trump in the presidential election. Katie Beaver, a first-year student at the Virginia Theological Seminary, checks her voter registration at campus event aimed at getting out the vote in November's midterm elections.\n                \n                    \n                    Jerome Socolovsky/NPR\n                    \n                \nhide caption Katie Beaver, a first-year student at the Virginia Theological Seminary, checks her voter registration at campus event aimed at getting out the vote in November's midterm elections. \"I hope the number is even higher\" in November, said Jenna Ellis, public policy director for the James Dobson Family Institute in Colorado Springs, which is running a \"Pray. Engage. Vote\" initiative ahead of the midterm elections. I would love to see even more evangelicals understand what is at stake in this election, understand what voting our values means. Jenna Ellis, James Dobson Family Institute Dobson was one of about a hundred evangelical preachers and religious leaders who attended a dinner in their honor at the White House in August. At the event, the president asked them to rally voters in the midterm elections, reportedly warning that if Democrats win they will \"will overturn everything that we've done and they'll do it quickly and violently.\" Ellis says she's concerned what might happen with abortion legislation, or, say, to a baker who refuses to make a cake for a same-sex wedding, if Democrats gain control of the House or Senate and eventually get liberal justices on the Supreme Court. \"I would love to see even more evangelicals understand what is at stake in this election, understand what voting our values means,\" she said. One Trump promise that excites mainly conservative evangelicals is a repeal of the Johnson Amendment. That amendment is a provision in the tax code that forbids non-profits, such as faith groups, from endorsing or opposing political candidates. Many other religious leaders oppose a repeal. They don't want their churches, mosques, synagogues and temples drawn into political campaigning. But some progressive leaders advocate increased activism. Megan Black, a national organizer for the progressive group Faith in Action, says avoiding politics is a luxury they can no longer afford. \"I think that the desire to remove oneself from the political arena especially today, when there is so much at stake for so many people, is a privilege that is exercised inappropriately,\" she said. Black's group is seeking to reach one million people in person, especially in areas where turnout is traditionally low, and persuade them to vote. For Faith in Action, the main moral issues are voter suppression, immigration crackdowns and police shootings. Back at the seminary, Dillon Green, a first year student from Alabama, believes in mixing his religion with his politics. \"That's one of the reasons I'm passionate about voting,\" he said. \"I want ... to say, you know, I believe in Jesus Christ AND I believe in liberal progressive values.\" Green hopes the religious left's renewed political zeal will yield fruit. But he also recognizes that conservative evangelical efforts to turn out the vote have been more productive in the past. For both groups, the moral character of the country now hangs in the balance.",

Wednesday's election in Pakistan marks the second time in the country's 71-year history that power will be passed from one civilian government to another. But the weeks leading to the vote have been marred by extreme violence. Activists, journalists and candidates say the campaign was tainted, throwing a fragile democratic process into question. \"There were huge complaints about what happened in the lead-up this time around,\" says Omar Waraich, deputy South Asia director at Amnesty International. \"We've had very serious allegations about arbitrary detentions, about restrictions on the media, about attacks on people's rights to freedom of assembly, association and expression.\" Some candidates have shifted their allegiances to rival parties or run as independents, suggesting pressure or intimidation. Journalists contend that their reporting is being suppressed. And there are accusations of interference by the military, which has used its might in the past to stage coups and oust leaders. \"The fact that you have the relentless efforts to crack down on dissent and the media \u2014 you're seeing democratic institutions being besieged in Pakistan, and that bodes ill for democratization,\" says Michael Kugelman, senior associate for South Asia at the Wilson Center in Washington, D.C. Voting day came after a spate of terrorist attacks killing civilians and politicians \u2014 including a suicide bombing in the provincial town of Mastung that killed more than 150 people at a campaign rally. To prepare for the tens of millions of people expected to vote, police blocked off roads and cleared buildings for the counting of ballots. Hundreds of thousands of troops were deployed to polling stations and police in Pakistan's northwest have deployed surveillance vehicles to stream live video. More than 80,000 polling booths are scheduled to open across the country, with nearly 106 million people registered to vote. The preliminary results are expected to come in hours after polls close on Wednesday evening. The early hours of voting day were already blighted with violence in the southwestern city of Quetta, where a suicide bomber targeting a police van killed more than 28 people outside a polling station, and the death toll was expected to rise.

Over 100 parties have registered to run for national and regional parliamentary seats, but nationally, it's a closely contested race between two: the former ruling party, Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz, led by the brother of jailed former Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif, and Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf, with Imran Khan, a former cricket star, at its helm. \"All the polls show it's neck-and-neck,\" says Kugelman. Khan, 65, made his name as an international cricketer before founding his political party in 1996. His party has never held national power and vows to fight corruption. He has criticized his country's counter-terrorism efforts, calling for peace talks with Pakistan's Taliban. \"What's clear is that Imran Khan is getting more support than he's ever gotten before. And that's not because of any rigging. There is a general enthusiasm for him,\" says Waraich. \"The question is, does that mean he builds up enough support to form a majority in parliament?\" Sharif, 68, a three-time prime minister, was disqualified from office last year by the Supreme Court, after the Panama Papers leak revealed that he had secret property in London. He was handed a 10-year prison sentence this month. His brother Shehbaz, 66, now leads the party, which traditionally holds strong sway in Punjab, the most populous province, and now accuses the military of favoring Khan. This month, police opened some 17,000 criminal cases against PML-N candidates, and detained hundreds of party supporters. The Pakistan People's Party, led by Asif Zardari, former president and husband of the assassinated former Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto, is also fielding candidates. He co-leads the party with his son, Bilawal. The party is expected to form a large bloc in Pakistan's parliament \u2014 and potentially act as a deal-maker if a coalition will be formed. It's not that the military necessarily supports Khan, says Kugelman. \"The army essentially wants a weak coalition government, and that's because the army in Pakistan is a very powerful force that tends to influence politics,\" he says. \"It's so much easier to exploit and influence a weak and divided government, as opposed to a strong government led by one party.\" The army, he says, does not want to see the ruling party come back. \"I do think there is reason to fear that the army is trying to undercut the electoral prospects of the ruling [PML-N] party, which the army has sparred with quite frequently over the last two years,\" he says. The military views Khan as the least bad outcome, he says. Among dozens of other political groups vying for representation in parliament are extremist parties \u2014 including a front for a militant organization whose leader, Hafiz Saeed, is on a United Nations terrorist blacklist. Saeed stands accused of masterminding attacks in India that left more than 160 people dead. \"By having all these hardline religious parties in the election fray, you risk legitimizing their ideologies, which in many cases are toxic and violent,\" Kugelman warns. While some militants have campaigned freely, some secular candidates faced travel restrictions and house arrest, the BBC reported. The election's \"most likely outcome,\" he believes, \"is a lack of a clear winner,\" meaning there will be continued political volatility. Interviews among voters across rural and urban areas of Pakistan suggest that bread-and-butter issues \u2014 jobs, food costs, economic growth \u2014 remain most important. In a working-class area of Lahore, many residents said they'd vote for Sharif's party. Roshan Abbas, a rickshaw driver, said the party had improved the roads, and installed streetlights and sanitation in his area. In the same area, those who said they'd vote for Khan's party said they wanted change \u2013 and said they'd been neglected by Sharif's party. \"We are poor,\" said Mohammed Ishtiyaq, a wedding singer, so \"they did not do anything in my area.\" \"The roads are broken,\" he said. \"The sewage system is in a shambles.\" For other voters \u2013 chiefly in urban, middle-class areas \u2014 there was a sense of fatigue with the old ruling party. Col. Amjad Feroze, 45, said he'd vote for Khan, hoping he'd fix Pakistan's chronically weak economy and security challenges. \"Basically, we have tested and tried the previous one, they didn't come up to our expectations. Let's give a chance to a new person,\" he said. Abdul Sattar contributed to this story from Islamabad.",

            "article_content": "San Francisco's special mayoral election is exposing racial, ethnic and economic fault lines. The leading candidates represent just how much the city has changed in recent years due to tech money.  MARY LOUISE KELLY, HOST: In San Francisco, the unexpected death of Mayor Ed Lee in December has set off a hard-fought campaign to succeed him. As Scott Shafer from member station KQED reports, the contest shines a bright light on that city's racial and economic divides. SCOTT SHAFER, BYLINE: The morning Mayor Lee died, London Breed, the 43-year-old president of the board of supervisors, automatically became acting mayor. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) LONDON BREED: And I ask for your patience. And I ask for your support. And I ask for your prayers. SHAFER: Breed is a native San Franciscan who grew up in one of the city's toughest public housing projects. By San Francisco standards, Breed is seen as a moderate and somewhat business-friendly. And that didn't sit well with liberals who felt her new high profile was giving her an unfair advantage in the race for mayor. The supervisors had to decide whether to keep Breed on or replace her with a caretaker mayor until the June election. That led to dozens of people like Brad Chapin testifying in support of Breed... (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) BRAD CHAPIN: I think that we absolutely must have a woman of color be our acting mayor or appointed mayor. SHAFER: ...And opposing her, like supervisor Hillary Ronen, who said Breed is in the pocket of wealthy tech moguls. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) HILLARY RONEN: They are threatening people if they don't support London Breed. They are saying that people's careers will be ruined if they don't support London Breed. SHAFER: After a raucous debate, the supervisors voted to replace Breed with another supervisor, Mark Farrell, a white former venture capitalist who represents some of the city's wealthiest neighborhoods. Breed's supporters, especially African-American women, were furious. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN: (Chanting) Shame on you. Shame on you. Shame... SHAFER: The whole episode has reopened painful wounds in San Francisco. JAMES TAYLOR: It's almost like these white liberals are undermining the black woman mayor on behalf of the black community. SHAFER: James Taylor teaches political science at the University of San Francisco. TAYLOR: You can talk to most older African-American San Franciscans. And if you mention redevelopment, they will tell you it was - urban renewal was Negro removal. That sentiment has carried over for 40 years. SHAFER: As African-Americans have left the city, the Asian-American and Latino populations have grown. But they, too, now feel the economic squeeze. City supervisor Jeff Sheehy, who cast the deciding vote to replace London Breed, puts it this way. JEFF SHEEHY: Everything that made us so attractive that we became the boom place for tech - it was our tolerance, our values, our diversity. The people who built that are being pushed out. SHAFER: Among the candidates running for mayor besides Breed are another supervisor who is an Asian-American woman and an openly gay man who's a former state senator. City supervisor Malia Cohen says the whole controversy is a distraction. MALIA COHEN: We should be coming together to talk about homelessness and car break-ins and many of the issues that are at the forefront of people's minds. But now race, gender and sexual orientation are going to be at the forefront. SHAFER: Competing no doubt with the pressing issue of income inequality and the cost of living in San Francisco. But there is an upside to this political skirmish, says David Lee, who's active in the city's Asian-American community. DAVID LEE: I think people are deeply invested in this election in a way that I haven't seen before. And for the first time in a long time, we're going to have a really open election. SHAFER: Whoever wins in June will serve only the rest of the late mayor's term, so next year voters will once again decide who should lead this city for another four years. For NPR News, I'm Scott Shafer in San Francisco. [POST-BROADCAST CLARIFICATION: In this report, we say Brad Chapin was among dozens of people testifying in support of London Breed, San Francisco\u2019s acting mayor. As Chapin said at a public meeting, he believes the acting or appointed mayor should be a woman of color such as Breed. But his preferred candidate for mayor in the June election is a different city supervisor, Jane Kim.] Copyright \u00a9 2018 NPR.  All rights reserved.

It's about whether there should be a runoff. And in Georgia, if neither candidate gets 50 percent plus one vote, then there's a runoff. Kemp has about 50.4 percent right now, so Democrats are hoping that will come down below 50 percent. And then there would be a runoff on December 4. And like you said, late today, the Kemp campaign claimed there's no way for Abrams to force a runoff. But there are still these outstanding military and overseas ballots that have a Friday deadline to be received. So it seems premature to claim victory at this point. CHANG: OK. So if there is a runoff, Kemp would oversee that. I mean, let's just remind people, Kemp is wearing two hats here. He's running for governor as a candidate, but he's also secretary of state, so he's the top regulator of elections in the state. KAUFFMAN: Right. The Kemp campaign, Kemp himself has not gotten - given any indication that he would step back if there's a recount or some sort of recanvassing of the votes that are out there right now. CHANG: OK. So where is the Abrams campaign thinking it will find the votes it needs? KAUFFMAN: Yeah, the Abrams campaign held a conference call with reporters today before Kemp claimed victory, and they laid out their strategy to push for all votes to be counted. The campaign's big focus is absentee ballots. They say there are thousands yet to be counted. They're also looking at provisional ballots. There were long lines and technical issues on Election Day that led to more people casting provisional ballots, and they have until Friday to verify those and have those counted. And so then there's just a lot of moving parts here. CHANG: Yeah. So where has this left Georgia residents? I mean, have you had the chance to talk to people? What are they thinking about this race at this point? KAUFFMAN: Yeah. I think they're confused and uncertain. We spoke with a number of voters today, including Brent Dey. He's a Democrat in Atlanta. And here's what he had to say about Kemp overseeing the race while he's on the ballot. BRENT DEY: I'm willing to give our secretary of state the benefit of the doubt in all situations. I don't know if that's rigging or not. I don't know if something funny is going on there or not, but he's set up an environment where the question is in my mind. KAUFFMAN: However this turns out, it really seems that both sides are going to question the results - for whoever loses. CHANG: Right. KAUFFMAN: I mean, Republicans right now are celebrating a Kemp victory. You can see this on Twitter, since Kemp has declared that he's won. And just last weekend, Kemp's office announced an investigation into the state Democratic Party for hacking. The office has not presented any clear evidence of an attempted hack there. So people are frustrated. And we're still waiting to figure out what's really going to happen here. CHANG: All right. So still a lot left to unfold. That's Johnny Kauffman of WABE in Atlanta. Thank you very much. KAUFFMAN: Yeah, thanks for having me. Copyright \u00a9 2018 NPR.  All rights reserved.

            "article_content": "Iraqis voted in their first election since the military defeat of ISIS over the weekend. While final results have not been issued, one near-certain result is the political rise of Iraq's Shiite militias.  ARI SHAPIRO, HOST: Now we're going to dig in on the surprising twist coming out of Iraq's parliamentary elections, the rise of a man who had led battles against American troops. Votes are still being tallied, but the final count is unlikely to change the bigger picture of the results. NPR's Jane Arraf sent us this report from Baghdad. JANE ARRAF, BYLINE: Followers of Shia cleric Muqtada al-Sadr have gathered in Baghdad's Tahrir Square to celebrate since election results started coming in. Sadr led militia forces that fought U.S. troops after the invasion of Iraq. He disbanded that militia, and now he's emerged as the big winner in Iraq's first post-ISIS elections. His supporters, like Sami Abdul Kulthum Dohan (ph), have high hopes. SAMI ABDUL KULTHUM DOHAN: (Through interpreter) This time, there will be change that will be good for everyone. ARRAF: And by that, he means a government that provides public services and creates jobs, instead of stealing money. That's how a lot of Iraqis think of their politicians. Sadr won't meet with U.S. officials. He opposes interference by both the U.S. and Iran in Iraqi affairs. Although he comes from a revered family of Shia religious scholars, for this election, he put aside religion and created an alliance that includes Sunnis, secularists and communists. The elections, though, are just the start of forming a government. No group has enough seats to form one on its own, so they need to form alliances for a coalition. It's even more complicated because the second-biggest winner is a group that includes former militia leaders with ties to Iran. They answered a religious call to fight ISIS four years ago, and now they've turned to politics. And then there's Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi. He was expected to win but instead he's come in third. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) PRIME MINISTER HAIDER AL-ABADI: (Foreign language spoken). ARRAF: Abadi was educated in the U.K. He's considered a moderate. He's supported keeping U.S. troops here and reforming the economy. If he cuts the right deals, Abadi could still be prime minister. But Sadr and Iranian-backed militia leaders winning so much support puts Iraq and the U.S. in uncharted territory. Jane Arraf, NPR News, Baghdad. Copyright \u00a9 2018 NPR.  All rights reserved.

            "article_content": "In midterm elections, a majority of Americans typically don't vote. Sometimes that's because of apathy or a lack of knowledge about the process. But for some Americans who want to vote, legal barriers keep them from the polls.  ARI SHAPIRO, HOST: In recent midterm elections, about 60 percent of eligible voters did not cast ballots. Some said they don't vote because they're too busy or don't think their vote matters. Others want to vote but can't. They face a range of obstacles from voter ID laws to their own criminal records. NPR political correspondent Asma Khalid reports. ASMA KHALID, BYLINE: Back in the year 2000, Jagada Chambers was sent to prison for attempted second-degree murder. He was released four years later. This all happened in Florida, which bars citizens with felony convictions from voting unless they receive clemency from a state board led by the governor. JAGADA CHAMBERS: I assume that I committed my crime in Florida so therefore I thought I'd been disenfranchised forever. KHALID: An estimated 10 percent of adults in Florida cannot vote because of a felony record. But Chambers was not a Floridian, and so those strict rules didn't apply to him. CHAMBERS: I was free over a decade not knowing that I was able to vote. KHALID: Chambers was not legally barred from voting in California and later in Nevada where he now lives. But he was confused. Other people don't vote because they're inconvenienced, and legal barriers can contribute to that. In 2016, 4 percent of registered voters did not vote because of registration problems, according to a Pew Research Center analysis. One of those problems is tied to an upsurge in voter purging. States routinely clean up the voting rolls to ensure their records are accurate, and they remove people who've moved or died. But according to a report from the Brennan Center published this summer, 4 million more people were purged between 2014 and 2016 than in the equivalent period between 2006 and 2008. Jonathan Brater is one of the authors of this report. JONATHAN BRATER: Voter purges can have the effect of making it more difficult for people who are not necessarily the most regular voters. KHALID: Some Southern states have seen a particular uptick. BRATER: Georgia has had a number of problematic and controversial voter registration and purging practices over the last few years. KHALID: Georgia takes people off the voting rolls if they don't vote in four consecutive federal elections and do not respond to a letter in the mail. Georgia also allows neighbors to challenge one another's eligibility. Supporters of this law say it helps root out voter fraud. Back in 2015, these voter challenges were used in mass in Hancock County, a rural area about 100 miles east of Atlanta. Approximately 17 percent of all registered voters in Sparta, the largest town in the county, had their voting eligibility challenged, and most of the people on that list were black, like Merritt Hubert. He and his brother were accused of not living at the address on file. MERRITT HUBERT: Basically, they just wanted to scratch our name off the list, you know, period, that we don't live in Hancock County. KHALID: Hubert gestures to the yellow mobile home behind him. It's off a dusty side road, and he says he's lived here the whole time. Even the letter accusing him of not living here came in the mail to this address. Why do you think this happened? HUBERT: Basically, I think it's a racism thing, that they want white - whites to run the town. KHALID: The goal, he thinks, was voter suppression. In a settlement, the board of elections denied its motive was racial discrimination. The county attorney, Barry Fleming, told The New York Times it was about restoring order to an electoral process tainted by corruption and incompetence. Still, the board agreed to change how it reviews challenges, and most people's names, including Hubert's, were added back to the voting rolls. But Jonathan Brater with the Brennan Center says that may not fix everything. BRATER: When people have bad experiences with the voting system, I think, you know, a lot of people react to that by saying, well, you know, forget about it. I'm not going to do this again. KHALID: Some people, though, are like Merritt Hubert. He says this whole experience has made him more determined to vote. Asma Khalid, NPR News. Copyright \u00a9 2018 NPR.  All rights reserved.

            "article_content": "White people have called the police on African-Americans during everyday activities. We look into the historical reasons authorities are called when white people felt uncomfortable.  RACHEL MARTIN, HOST: By now, much of America has seen the video of two black men being taken from a Philadelphia Starbucks in handcuffs. This is from back in April. The manager called the police after the men were just sitting there waiting for someone for a business meeting without ordering anything. Other related videos have followed. In the past few months, several white people have now been recorded calling police on black people who were just going about their daily lives in myriad places - the dorm, the pool, mowing the lawn. Karen Grigsby Bates from our Code Switch team looks at why those calls have become so prevalent. KAREN GRIGSBY BATES, BYLINE: The video of that Starbucks encounter went viral in a matter of hours. People still talk about it. Writer Melissa DePino was in the Starbucks on Spruce Street when it happened and was shocked. MELISSA DEPINO: I know these things happen, but I've never actually physically witnessed it myself. And when I saw it, I thought, people need to see this. BATES: Some people argue that the tape might not show the whole story, but witnesses agree it does. ROBIN DIANGELO: Because we lived so separately and because it doesn't happen to us, those of us who are white, we haven't believed them. BATES: That's Robin DiAngelo. She's white and has spent her professional life writing, training, teaching white people about race and social justice issues. Her latest book is \"White Fragility: Why It's So Hard For White People To Talk About Racism.\" Many, maybe most white people, DiAngelo says, tend to second-guess black complaints about racism. DIANGELO: Are you sure that's what they meant? I think you're oversensitive. You're playing the race card. BATES: But technology has made it a little harder to make that argument, says professor Jody Armour. JODY ARMOUR: Thanks to social media, there's no longer as much impunity-free discrimination that people can express toward others. BATES: Armour teaches at the University of Southern California's Gould School of Law, and many of his classes and lectures are about how race is used and misused by the legal system. ARMOUR: You can look at what's going on right now as just an expression of the age-old black tax. The black tax is the price black people pay because of stereotypes and prejudice in America in their official interactions with police and in their everyday interactions with the ordinary citizens. BATES: Writer Robin DiAngelo agrees that white supervision of the black presence is very American. DIANGELO: We have always policed the bodies of people of color, and again, black people in particular. The Jim Crow South is a classic example, white flight in the North, school segregation, gerrymandering. BATES: Add to that cutting the lawn, delivering newspapers, visiting the pool. Oh, and this. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) UNIDENTIFIED PERSON: We have this lady that's been walking up from Mather and, like, for no apparent reason is walking from house to house. BATES: That was 911 dispatch tape, and that lady was Oregon State Representative Janelle Bynum, who was campaigning in her district. She's up for re-election this fall. And yep, Bynum is black. It later got straightened out. The cop who came was great. The caller apologized. And they even laughed about it. But Starbucks witness Melissa DePino says white people calling the police on brown people like Bynum need to stop and think. DEPINO: What they don't seem to understand is that calling the police when a person of color for just going about their lives is extremely dangerous given the way our policing and criminal justice system works. BATES: That was uppermost in Michelle Saahene mind when she sat in that Philly Starbucks watching police arrest those two men. Saahene, a life coach, is black and says she'd spent an hour there watching the manager let some people use the space without ordering anything at all. MICHELLE SAAHENE: There was a gentleman sitting next to me, a white man sitting next to me for 45 minutes who didn't buy anything. I saw a white woman mid-jog come in to use the bathroom and leave. BATES: When the arrest began, Saahene says, no one spoke up at first. So she approached the police, even though she was afraid to. She didn't know if it would make a difference. SAAHENE: But I have to try. I have to say something so these guys know that they're not alone. BATES: USC's Jody Armour says this is a role sympathetic white people can and should play. ARMOUR: First and foremost, white allies can start by taking advantage of their white privilege to make statements that blacks can't make, to be in places that blacks often aren't. BATES: And Robin DiAngelo agrees - white silence in the presence of racism is complicity. Karen Grigsby Bates, NPR News.

            "article_content": "If Democrats win control of the House in the midterm elections, the White House will likely face aggressive congressional investigations.  NOEL KING, HOST: All right. President Trump says he thinks House Republicans will do well in the midterm elections next week, but if they don't and Democrats take control of the House, his administration will face something it hasn't had to deal with yet - oversight from the opposition party. NPR's White House correspondent Tamara Keith has the story. TAMARA KEITH, BYLINE: We aren't making any predictions here, but if Democrats do take over the House, here's how Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi described her party's plan to CNN. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) NANCY PELOSI: What we will do is exercise oversight, which is the responsibility of the Congress of the United States. KEITH: For months, Democrats in the House have been sending strongly worded letters to the Trump administration demanding documents and other information. But if they win, rather than toothless letters, their requests would have the bite of subpoena power. Neil Eggleston was White House counsel for President Obama and worked for the Clinton administration, which faced endless investigations. NEIL EGGLESTON: When the subpoenas started coming, they start coming pretty fast and furious. Congress puts a lot of pressure on to respond quickly and is quite vocal in the press about failure to respond quickly, and so there's a lot of pressure on the White House counsel's office. KEITH: The White House counsel's office has to make decisions about how to respond to requests from Congress that go to the White House but also the rest of the administration. Alberto Gonzales says the best bet is to negotiate and try to avoid subpoenas or having to assert executive privilege. Gonzales was White House counsel to President George W. Bush. ALBERTO GONZALES: You burn political capital every time you assert privilege. Immediately, your opponents in Congress, the media will say, what are you hiding, you know, why are you asserting privilege? KEITH: And if the White House isn't careful, dealing with investigations and oversight requests can become all-consuming. Eggleston says President Clinton made a point of not wanting it to overwhelm policy work. EGGLESTON: We tried very much to isolate that function so that that function didn't essentially paralyze the entire building, which was, you know, sometimes successful and sometimes not as successful. KEITH: So what is the Trump White House doing to prepare for the possibility of a Democratic House? Multiple requests for comment were declined on the grounds that they don't want to talk about something that they hope doesn't happen. Ty Cobb, who until earlier this year was the White House lawyer dealing with the special counsel investigation, was asked by CNN whether they're ready. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) TY COBB: Yes. Are they prepared? Are there people there who are prepared for that? Yes, there are. They're going to have to add more lawyers. KEITH: For starters, the lawyer in the Trump White House who had been handling oversight requests left over the summer, and no replacement has been announced. White House counsel Don McGahn left last month before his named replacement could get security clearance. So a lawyer named Emmet Flood is in the role temporarily. Flood actually has a lot of experience dealing with these very issues in past administrations, but it's not clear whether he would do that for President Trump. Bob Bauer, who was a White House counsel for President Obama, says there is another factor that hiring more lawyers can't fix. ROBERT BAUER: There's the question of whether you're going to have a client whom you can appropriately support, who's going to make it possible for the lawyers to act in defense of the institutional presidency. And that's an open question with Donald Trump. KEITH: Setting aside Trump, if Democrats do take the House, there will likely be some skilled Republican lawyers with Congressional experience looking for work, and the White House may just be looking to hire them.

            "article_content": "A Memoir of Working Hard and Being Broke in the Richest Country on Earth by Sarah Smarsh Hardcover, 290 pages | Your purchase helps support NPR programming. How? Sarah Smarsh is a daughter of the white working class. Born in rural Kansas, Smarsh traces her lineage back through five generations of family farmers. She also traces herself back through generations of teenage pregnancies; Smarsh's mother was just 17 when she had her. During the 1980s, when Smarsh was growing up, family farms were going under in record numbers, falling victim to foreclosure and the rise of giant agribusiness. By then, Smarsh's dad was taking any job he could get, including roofing, driving semitrucks and disposing of poisonous industrial solvents \u2014 a job that almost killed him. As a family, the Smarshes were just hanging on, living below the poverty line. But like many others in their situation, they considered themselves middle class. Looking back in wonderment, Smarsh writes: That we could live on a patch of Kansas dirt with a tub of Crisco lard and a $1 rebate coupon in an envelope on the kitchen counter and call ourselves middle class was at once a triumph of contentedness and a sad comment on our country's lack of awareness about its own economic structure. Class didn't exist in a democracy like ours, as far as most Americans were concerned, at least not as a destiny or an excuse. You got what you worked for, we believed. There was some truth to that. But it was not the whole truth. Smarsh's new memoir is called Heartland and it tries to tell more of that \"whole truth.\" As you can hear in Smarsh's voice, her book is smart, nuanced and atmospheric. Though Smarsh is now a journalist with a graduate degree, she hasn't written the predictable \"up by my own bootstraps\" saga of individual perseverance and class ascent. Quite the contrary. Smarsh spent 15 years researching her memoir and her lens is unusually wide and deep. For instance, when she describes that incident of her dad's on-the-job chemical poisoning, she also connects it to a larger story about how the rise of the nation's for-profit hospital system in the 1980s made regular medical care too costly for uninsured families like hers. Thinking about her dad \u2014 as well as her relatives with missing teeth, swelling feet, mental illness and addictions \u2014 Smarsh says, \"It's a hell of a thing ... to grow the food, serve the drinks, hammer the houses, and assemble the airplanes that bodies with more money eat and drink and occupy and board, while your own body can't go to the doctor.\" With the same lyrical boldness, Smarsh talks about politics and race. She has no hesitation acknowledging white privilege, but she also notes the puzzlement, shot through with disdain, that she encountered once she got to college and began describing her farm childhood in Kansas. Smarsh says folks of all backgrounds would say to her that they \"had[n't]\" heard anything like [her story] since The Grapes of Wrath.\" It's hard not to internalize that kind of contempt. It was no surprise, then, that when Smarsh was admitted to the University of Kansas on a federally funded program for minority, first-generation, and low-income students, the small handful of white kids already in the program had given themselves the nickname \"White Trash Scholars.\" Heartland deepens our understanding of the crushing ways in which class shapes possibility in this country. It's an unsentimental tribute to the working-class people Smarsh knows \u2014 the farmers, office clerks, trash collectors, waitresses \u2014 whose labor is often invisible or disdained. It's also a tribute to the Kansas that Smarsh still feels connected to, a place of beer parties amid \"fragrant rolls of wet hay\" and tractors pulling sleds full of kids through the flat, snowy fields. Trying to capture the good, the bad, and the ugly of her white, working-class childhood in this memoir, Smarsh reflects: \"We can't really know what made us who we are. We can come to understand, though, what the world says we are.\" In Heartland, Smarsh powerfully talks back to a world that mostly told her and her family they were disposable.",

That's one of the big unanswered questions to emerge from the transcript released Thursday of the House Intelligence Committee's interview with Glenn Simpson, founder of the political research shop Fusion GPS. Simpson not only told lawmakers the Russians \"infiltrated,\" in his phrase, the National Rifle Association, which has been the subject of reports before. (The NRA has not offered any comment on those accounts.) Simpson also said this: \"I would say broadly speaking, it appears that the Russian operation was designed to infiltrate conservative organizations. And they targeted various conservative organizations, religious and otherwise, and they seem to have made a very concerted effort to get in with the NRA.\" The FBI is investigating that specific connection, as Peter Stone and Greg Gordon reported for McClatchy. The case involves a powerful Russian banker who may have given money to the NRA, which, in turn, spent at least $55 million on the 2016 elections. About $30 million of that supported Donald Trump's presidential bid. So one question for investigators might be: Was there any foreign money involved? That isn't clear and Justice Department special counsel Robert Mueller talks publicly about as much as the Lincoln Memorial. The strategy of \"infiltration\" or co-option is a classic, though; Russia's intelligence agencies recruited via the Communist Party of the United States back in the old days and also attached themselves to ostensibly pro-peace and minority rights movements. The through-line from then to now is visible in some of the other comments Simpson made to lawmakers, including what he called Russian support for the California and Texas \"independence movements,\" which appears to be all about simple irritation for the federal government. Moscow was irate about what it viewed as American meddling in its front yard \u2014 Ukraine \u2014 and wanted payback. But the broader question Simpson broached has not been addressed: How broadly did Russia's campaign of \"active measures\" in 2016 integrate itself with national American political groups? The big picture: Each new crumb of information adds to the total understanding of the Russian attack in 2016, which may be well understood inside the classified world, or by members of Congress, but which has never been detailed officially by the government for the public. (In fact, the government is prosecuting a former National Security Agency contractor, Reality Winner, for allegedly leaking one of the few official documents to emerge about the attack.) So people on the outside must do \"intelligence analysis\" of their own, \"fusing\" pieces of \"OSINT\" to form a \"mosaic\" based on congressional testimony, official reports and court documents. That's how we've formed the picture so far. We know that Russian agents made personal overtures to Trump campaign workers. We know cyber-operatives hacked political operators and organizations and leaked what they stole; we also know a broad social media campaign amplified controversy and pitted U.S. political opponents against each other. In that context, it certainly makes sense that Moscow might also have spent money as part of what the U.S. intelligence community calls its goal to help elect Trump \u2014 but the tidbits in the Simpson transcript are also a reminder about how much there could be that we still don't know about this story. White House communications director Hope Hicks did not go to Capitol Hill on Friday to talk with the House Intelligence Committee about the Russia imbroglio. She was supposed to have been its third guest of the week, following former Trump campaign heavies Steve Bannon and Corey Lewandowski, but administration officials called her back. Nobody seems to know what's going on. The White House denies it has invoked executive privilege \u2014 the legal doctrine that allows an administration to shield its inner workings and conversations \u2014 but there have been all kinds of rumblings about it from Capitol Hill. Bannon also frustrated some members of Congress in what he was and wasn't willing to say, but there isn't much clarity about what and why. White House communications director Hope Hicks at an event in the Roosevelt Room of the White House on March 27, 2017, in Washington, D.C.\n                \n                    \n                    Pool/Getty Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption White House communications director Hope Hicks at an event in the Roosevelt Room of the White House on March 27, 2017, in Washington, D.C. One theory is the Trump administration is making soft invocations of the privilege \u2014 instructing or permitting witnesses essentially to say, \"I won't answer because the White House reserves the right to invoke executive privilege, even though I don't have a lawyer letter in my hand formally doing so.\" Another way the Trump White House may be testing precedent is by claiming that executive privilege shields things that took place during the transition period that followed Trump's election but before his inauguration. That, as NPR's Carrie Johnson reports, would be unusual. Steve Bannon's synopsis to Michael Wolff about the Russia imbroglio has now become part of history: \"You realize where this is going. This is all about money laundering.\" A slew of new reports appears to strengthen that case. Jason Leopold and Anthony Cormier of BuzzFeed News write that were a mess of unusual payments to and from Sergey Kislyak, the former Russian ambassador to the U.S. who's a central figure in the Russia matter. Sundeep Kavanal Radesh quotes a German report in the IBTimes that says Deutsche Bank is passing evidence about questionable Trump money transfers to German regulators and Mueller's office. The German finance giant is one of the Family Trump's largest creditors and has paid hundreds of millions of dollars in fines as part of settlements in which it has admitted financial crimes. The White House, however, has denied reports that the bank has received a subpoena from Mueller to reveal its dealings with the Trumps. And as Christopher Brennan writes in the New York Daily News, evidence about wire transfers or checks or payments \u2014 if there is any \u2014 only takes you so far in a criminal case: \"Special Counsel Robert Mueller is following the money, but money doesn't always talk,\" he writes. Or as a former FBI special agent tells Brennan in the story: \"[A]ll you got is a check with a big dollar amount. The check can't testify. You need a witness to back up that check. It boils down to witnesses and testimony.\" We know too little for sure about what Mueller and his team are actually doing that there's no way to assess what kind of evidence they have or what case they might make. But there are a few clues in the indictments he's already brought against former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort and his business partner, Rick Gates. Those are money laundering cases, although so far unconnected to the 2016 Russian active measures campaign and not related to the Trump campaign either. But presumably Mueller and his team believe they've got enough in hand to make those cases to a jury. About that: Manafort and Gates might not actually go on trial until the late summer or fall, as NPR's Carrie Johnson reported. The judge in their case said she didn't understand the legal positions they were taking after Manafort decided to file his separate civil lawsuit against the Justice Department. Mueller and his office will not be affected by the partial government shutdown. As the fuse burned on Friday toward the prospect that the federal government might run out of money by midnight, the Justice Department made clear that Mueller and his office would not stop their work. The department released a \"contingency plan\" that delineates which employees are funded through which types of federal funding. Not all Justice Department workers would be spared, but Mueller and his office are funded with a permanent indefinite appropriation, the plan says. That means they can continue working and being paid irrespective of whether the support from Congress for the rest of the department \u2014 and the government \u2014 runs out.",

            "article_content": "Tune-Yards' I Can Feel You Creep Into My Private Life is out now.\n                \n\nhide caption Here's a fact few white American musicians feel comfortable facing: every kind of American music, from Top-40 pop to high mountain bluegrass, has some root in the work and creativity of people of color. Arguments about appropriation surface most commonly when artists are clearly borrowing from well-known sources; Justin Timberlake's decision to repackage his blue-eyed funk in Ralph Lauren-style quasi-neutrals is the latest example of white performers side-stepping the fact that they owe their very souls to black collaborators, acknowledged or not. For Merrill Garbus, whose synth-driven mash-ups of global rhythms and art-punk dreams in the duo Tune-Yards have always more openly confronted the issue of appropriation than most, partial acknowledgment of her debts stopped working at a certain point. After the release of 2014's Nikki-Nack, she resolved to face not just her cultural debts, but the ways she'd tried to sweep them to the side, even within the multiculturally savvy sound Tune-Yards embraced. In their new music, she vowed, she and her musical/life partner Nate Brenner would no longer wrap up the issue of white entitlement in a psychic Pendleton blanket. \"For me, it reached a crisis point,\" Garbus said by phone from her and Brenner's Oakland home earlier this week. \"I couldn't not speak about whiteness in my work.\" Ever the student, the Smith-educated Garbus, who writes most of Tune-Yards' lyrics, designed an anti-racist curriculum for herself. She attended a six-month anti-racist workshop at the East Bay Meditation Center. She read the work of noted anti-racist educator Tim Wise and explored the activism of Standing Up for Racial Justice, a nationwide, progressive activism network dedicated to \"moving white people to act as part of a multi-racial majority.\" Seeking new musical communities, she learned to DJ. Well aware that her sincerity would seem to some the epitome of white liberal sanctimoniousness, she sat with the discomfort that realization brought, along with many other vexed emotions. And she and Brenner made music, working with a small handful of collaborators to focus and complicate their excited, beat-driven arrangements, building glass houses of sound to better illuminate Garbus's confrontations with her own internalized secrets and lies. I Can Feel You Creep Into My Private Life is the most sophisticated Tune-Yards album, recalling classic meldings of pop and social observation like her friend Laurie Anderson's 1983 classic Mr. Heartbreak or the early hits of Frankie Goes To Hollywood. The album makes its arguments musically as much as through Garbus' words: there's a tension in the way the synth lines rub up against each other, occasionally punctuated by precise live drumming, that enhances Garbus' revelations about the struggle to confront and undo racism at the most intimate level. Garbus, who has always looked to the African diaspora for primary musical inspiration, trusted her co-producer Brenner to help her not reach for \"a sunny chord\" when the song called for more challenging juxtapositions. \"There was a lot of conversation about how the music interacts with the words,\" she says. \"And a lot of times, on the first pass, it was like, no, that's not what I'm saying.\" This struggle led to an album that contains more clarity of vision \u2013 and of sound \u2013 than anything Tune-Yards has previously offered. For Garbus, it's a beginning. \"I'm in the midst of this work,\" she said. \"I don't feel like it's past tense. I'll be doing it for the rest of my life.\" This was one of the first drum beats that I made on the OP-1. It's like a mini keyboard, but it does everything \u2014 it has a four-track recorder, a sampler, a drum machine, and a sequencer. It's just like this really ingenious machine, and it costs a lot of money, and it's worth every penny. I was reading the book Last Night a DJ Saved My Life: The History of the Disc Jockey and listening to older house tracks and wondering, what are the parameters of a house song? What's the rhythm actually life? In my limited knowledge of house music, I assumed those songs were boring rhythmically. But going back to those older records, I was like, \"No, no, no!\" In fact, those guys (and, I presume, women) were referencing the records they were listening to in order to create these new, complex rhythms. Inspired by that, I wanted to have an effect that was rhythmically off \u2013 really syncopated and unexpected. I just love the ukulele effects that we got here, working with [engineer] Beau Sorensen. We put the ukulele through all these pedals and then he did, I think, a delay on his end, and I just love the bass that got created from that. Theme- wise, I started writing the song pre-election \u2013 as I did a lot of these songs \u2013 and then it got finished post-election, and it reflects a lot of questions I have for myself about sides and side-taking, and how for the most part, that's such bulls***. But when is the moment when I do stand up and say, \"This is absolutely wrong?\" So many of these songs were confusing to create. They felt didactic. I knew there were all these annoying lyrics coming out of me, and was trying to figure out how to put it all together. We were working on the chorus with this quarter-note melody and I thought, well, f*** it. ABC, 123. And then from there, I thought, what if this represents a new language? A lot of this album is me trying to face things instead of running away from the reality of the world in this era. Thinking, if I could face the realities of climate change, of massive extinction, of white privilege and white fragility, then maybe I could guide listeners into also looking at things and not running away in all the ways that we do. Have you heard about this podcast, How To Survive the End of the World? It's these two sisters, Autumn and Adrienne Marie Brown. Adrienne Marie Brown wrote this book called Emergent Strategy. She has a lot of background in activist organizing. The podcast and her book really break things down and encourage listeners to confront what's actually happening. That really inspires me. I'm a Pisces \u2013 I'd rather live in the dream sphere. I don't want to touch down. But it feels like this is a moment where we need to be here, not in that dream world. \"With all the compassion in my heart, I just want to say to white people sampling others' music: what you're engaging in is colonialism,\" Merrill Garbus says. \"Name it for what it is.\"\n                \n                    \n                    Eliot Lee Hazel/Courtesy of the artist\n                    \n                \nhide caption \"With all the compassion in my heart, I just want to say to white people sampling others' music: what you're engaging in is colonialism,\" Merrill Garbus says. \"Name it for what it is.\" What often happens when white people start to confront racism is this idea of a good white self arises. Like, \"Other people are like this \u2014 not me!\" In the post-Trump era, progressives and liberals are finding ourselves wanting to distance ourselves from other white people. But if we grew up white in this country, we're racist, and that's what this song explores. The line that's the grossest for me is, \"Man, I want to take you home.\" A lot of the lyrics on this album came from working on myself, writing down all the gross things that I don't want to admit are in me somewhere. I listen to some Somali dance tape from the '80s and I think, I want that in my music! There's a colonial vibe to that. \"I'm an exception,\" and I want. Want, want, want. With all the compassion in my heart, I just want to say to white people sampling others' music: what you're engaging in is colonialism. Name it for what it is. Especially given the power dynamic today, with greater restrictions on entering the U.S. There's so much less access for musicians of color to say, \"Hey, glad you like it! Now I get to make money touring in your country.\" I used some language from meditation practice in this song. In the workshop that I did [a six-month course at the East Bay Meditation Center called \"White and Awakening on Race\"] we were asked to look at videotapes of police killings. We were read narratives of lynchings, describing what actually took place, in detail. And then we were asked to sit in meditation, and be honest with ourselves. I know there's a lot of criticism of all-white spaces and I don't necessarily ever want to be in an all-white space \u2013 it's triggering! But my experience of being in a group of white people who are there to be rigorously honest with ourselves and each other about what goes on, knowing that we weren't causing harm to people of color through our own exploitation of that stuff... that was where I had to ask myself the question: do you really want to know? A lot of the time, I didn't want to know. We deny our own racism, because it feels so ugly. I like to think that I'm an honest person, but there are all these ways that I understand myself now as a consistently dishonest person. Whether that's my habit of making other people happy all the time and not really engaging myself in my own truth before I act for the benefit of others; or a lot of stuff that has to do with whiteness. I just want to hold so tightly to not being a bad white person that I will deny all these other truths. Meditation gives room for those things, to confront them, and then hopefully move on. I cringed all the way through making that song. And at the risk exercising my white fragility, I'll tell you, I cried a lot, too. Something that I'm trying to learn is just speaking from my own experience.  I don't know a whole lot about the history of whiteness. I don't know a lot about racial justice activism, about organizing or the \"correct\" word to use politically. That doesn't mean that I get to be absolved from the responsibility to speak my experience. This is something that happened. I'm white. I heard my voice speaking to a friend about this experience that I had in Kenya. A lot of people think that I'm making fun of another white woman in \"Colonizer.\"  No. This is me. That one started with a drumbeat. I started it when I started DJ-ing at a club across the street from us. I had I made that beat and I was kind of practicing with it, practicing mixing it in with other records. I was trying to figure out, will people dance to this? I wrote a lot of lyrics on my way to and from our studio, walking by Lake Merritt in Oakland. And there was something about looking at my own hands... slowing things down and simplifying. You know \u2014 these are my hands! Is my cell phone in my hand? Where did my cell phone come from?. What's told just in my hands, and also by my own consumption? What am I doing in the world? Wanting to ask questions \u2013 like in [the 2009 Tune-Yards song] \"Little Tiger,\" with the lyric \"all you own you owe to someone you don't know\" \u2014 what invisible lines connect us to each other that we don't even acknowledge in our day to day? \"How does it injure me to be living in white supremacy?\" Garbus asks herself. \"There is value in a white person looking at it that way \u2013 I have more motivation to work against it when I personalize it.\"\n                \n                    \n                    Eliot Lee Hazel/Courtesy of the artist\n                    \n                \nhide caption \"How does it injure me to be living in white supremacy?\" Garbus asks herself. \"There is value in a white person looking at it that way \u2013 I have more motivation to work against it when I personalize it.\" Where this song is on the album, it felt like the right time to slow things down. It still feels really slow! Hamir [Atwal, the jazz drummer who appears on Private Life and tours with Tune-Yards] always gets it right when we're playing it live, whereas I'm always like, oh yes.... It's really that slow. The lyrics \"She's a fool....\" I had a friend say, it should be, \"He's a fool \u2013 this is the time for he's a fool!\" And that's easier to sing \u2013 my voice teacher pointed that out. \"Ha\" is easier than \"sha.\" But it's definitely me [in the lyric]. If I own what I'm foolish about in the beginning of the song then maybe by the end I get to own the lyric, \"You're not telling my story, man.\" I was just listening to Adrienne Marie Brown talk about her fiction writing, and she said that fiction is where she gets to embody the conflicting things inside her. And that's totally true for me in music. It's where those ideas are allowed to live in me. This song could so be about Trump, but that's not why I wrote it; it could so be about gender politics, but that's not why I wrote it. Yet it is about all of those things. It's totally about patriarchy, yes, but it also extends to white supremacy, and to neo-colonialism. It's all the poisons. \"Hammer\" barely made it onto the album. I was asking myself, is it too '80s? Is it cheesy? Is the keyboard sound dated? I have a tender spot for the '80s, and specifically for UB40's Labor Of Love, an album I grew up with. So I'm sure a lot of that is in there. Lyrically \u2013 it's understanding my limited knowledge and experience as a white person in Oakland, and asking, what is my place in this community. We hear so many statistics these days \u2013 What percentage of black men live into their 40s? What percentage of species will be alive on the planet in 50 years? These number mean these huge and horrifying things. But how do we process that information? Matt Nelson, a longtime collaborator of ours, completely nailed the sax solo.  He recorded it with us at Tiny Telephone Oakland and we were projecting Planet Earth on the studio ceiling, and I was just crying as he tracked.  This song gives me feelings, even though they're kind of murky and confusing...which I guess is what the song is about. This track quotes Ladysmith Black Mambazo (\"Reveal yourself, reveal yourself,\"' taken from \"King of Kings\"), which definitely is a reference both to how that group influenced me as a musician as well as to the complications of [Paul Simon's] Graceland project.  How does a musician like myself reconcile the legacy of Graceland, investigate what happened there and why, and how do I  learn from that, and do better? The lyric here is similar to the one in \"Now As Then,\" where I say, \"I don't want to be a woman if it means not being human.\" I've spent a lot of years working on owning being a woman. Of course I'm free \u2013 I've just spent this whole album talking about how privileged I am. But, \"Don't tell me I'm free,\" that's what came out. And I try to respect what gets channeled, even if it feels wrong. And also, the white supremacy and racism that we live in, it doesn't just damage people of color. To be able to say that, and understand that; it's not that I've suffered more than others. Of course I haven't. But I'm saying, I am affected. I'm asking, how does it injure me to be living in white supremacy. There is value in a white person looking at it that way \u2013 I have more motivation to work against it when I personalize it. And then it was important to take a break and say, \"I'm free.\" To belt that out.",

Updated at 6:25 p.m. ET In a surprise announcement on Tuesday, Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel said he will not be seeking a third term in office in the 2019 election. Emanuel, a former congressman and White House chief of staff, has come under heavy criticism in recent years for an increase in gun violence in the city and tense police-community relations as a result of police shootings. He has also struggled to get a handle on rising pension debt. But the announcement that he is walking away from the mayor's office is a political stunner. In a news conference at his City Hall office, called with short notice after opening a new school year in the city, Emanuel said he has never been one to shy away from tough decisions. \"Today, the time has come to make another tough choice,\" he said, with his wife, Amy Rule, at his side.  \"As much as I love this job, and will always love this city and its residents, I've decided not to seek re-election.\" \"This has been the job of a lifetime,\" Emanuel added, \"but it is not a job for a lifetime.\" Emanuel had already raised more than $10 million for his re-election campaign, member station WBEZ notes. The 58-year old did not give a reason for his decision to not run for a third term as mayor of the nation's third-largest city. He refused to answer reporters' questions, saying only that he and his wife \"look forward to writing that next chapter in our journey together.\" Emanuel served as a Democratic congressman, representing a district on Chicago's North Side for eight years before becoming President Barack Obama's chief of staff in 2009. He stepped down from that job in the fall of 2010 to return home to Chicago to run for mayor after then-Mayor Richard M. Daley, who had been in office for more than 20 years, announced that he would not seek re-election. Emanuel had been one of Daley's top fundraisers and strategists, before working on the 1992 campaign of President Bill Clinton. Emanuel's two terms in the Chicago mayor's office have been at times tumultuous, with the city struggling with financial problems he inherited from Daley, as well as spikes in deadly gun violence and fraught police-community relations.  But Emanuel had a huge campaign fundraising advantage over a dozen announced challengers, and recent polling data suggested he could win re-election. \"It's a political bombshell,\" says longtime political analyst and Chicago Sun-Times columnist Laura Washington. \"And its going to explode the political and leadership landscape for the city of Chicago for a long time to come.\" The timing of the announcement was notable, for several reasons. Former Illinois Gov. Pat Quinn has been pushing for a referendum vote on whether Chicago mayors should have a two-term limit on their time in office. As Reuters notes, Quinn's petition appears to have reached a milestone \u2014 enough signatures to be placed on the ballot, at least hypothetically \u2014 just a few days ago. And The Associated Press points out that Emanuel's news conference \"comes the day before the start of one of the biggest police-shooting trials in the history of Chicago \u2014 the murder trial of police officer Jason Van Dyke.\" In 2014, Van Dyke fatally shot black teenager Laquan McDonald. Police reports stated that it was an act of self-defense, but dashcam footage of the shooting, released more than a year later, showed McDonald was walking away from police as Van Dyke shot him. Emanuel's administration fought efforts to force the release of the video and quickly settled with McDonald's family for $5 million before the family even filed a lawsuit. When a judge ordered the video be released publicly in November 2015, huge protests against the shooting erupted in the city. The trial is expected to put his decisions under scrutiny once more. \"People in many parts of the city believed that he was engaged in a cover-up, that he hid the videotape and hid the circumstances of that shooting until he was re-elected [in 2015],\" says Washington, who worked in the 1980s as an aide to late Chicago Mayor Harold Washington. \"And some folks said that they would never forgive him for that ... and that would be the big reason why they wouldn't vote for his re-election.\" A subsequent Department of Justice investigation found widespread abuses of residents' civil rights, including that Chicago officers \"engaged in a pattern or practice of using excessive force, including deadly force,\" that officers often lied to cover up misconduct, and that the use of excessive force disproportionately affected black and Latino residents. But even before then, Emanuel struggled to gain many Chicagoans' trust and confidence. He clashed with Chicago Teachers Union leaders when teachers walked out on strike for seven days in 2012, he raised the ire of many parents and community leaders by closing 50 neighborhood schools in 2013, and he increased taxes in an effort to address rising employee pension costs and invest in neglected infrastructure, problems he inherited from his predecessor. Add to that the feeling among many city residents that they were being left out of an economic boom going on in downtown Chicago during the past several years, while there was relatively little job and economic development in the city's most impoverished neighborhoods. That anger helped fuel the progressive campaign of Cook County Commissioner Jesus \"Chuy\" Garcia, who forced Emanuel into a runoff election in 2015. \"The tale of two cities has haunted him since he came into office,\" says Washington. She says despite Emanuel's efforts to overcome that gap, \"he's never been able to be in a position where both sides of the city, the rich and the poor, the privileged and the left out, have felt that he represents all of them.\" Emanuel's accomplishments including a rising high school graduation rate in Chicago Public Schools, expanding full-day kindergarten citywide and making free pre-K programs available to more low-income families. He is also credited with putting city government on a path toward financial stability, after raising taxes and fees to shore up underfunded employee pension funds, and attracting several major corporations to relocate their headquarters to Chicago. He often boasts that there are more construction cranes operating in downtown Chicago, building more high-rises, than ever before. Even before Emanuel's stunning announcement, a dozen candidates had announced they would challenge him for the office of mayor in next February's city elections \u2014 including an activist, a millionaire businessman, a college student, the former head of Chicago Public Schools, the Cook County Circuit Court clerk and an ex-federal prosecutor who is the former president of the Chicago Police Board. Former police Superintendent Garry McCarthy, whom Emanuel fired after the release of the McDonald shooting video, is also running. But no one is expected to run away with the race. And with Emanuel now stepping aside, even more candidates \u2014 perhaps with deeper pockets and better name recognition \u2014 may now enter the mayoral campaign.",

Smith/AFP/Getty Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption Attorney Michael Cohen arrives at Trump Tower for meetings with then-President-elect Donald Trump in December 2016. Updated at 8:15 p.m. ET President Trump unloaded on both Justice Department special counsel Robert Mueller and Attorney General Jeff Sessions, hours after federal agents raided the office of Trump's longtime personal attorney Michael Cohen. \"It's a disgraceful situation. It's a total witch hunt,\" Trump said on Monday. \"When I saw this, when I heard about it, that is a whole new level of unfairness.\" It was not immediately clear why investigators targeted Cohen, but Cohen's lawyer said the raids followed a referral from Mueller. The New York Times, which first reported the raid, said that it does not appear as though the Cohen search was directly linked to the Russia investigation. The Times and the Washington Post reported Cohen is under investigation for possible bank fraud. Nonetheless, a visibly agitated Trump, speaking to reporters before he met with military and national security officials about the ongoing situation in Syria, put blame on Mueller and Sessions. Trump called Mueller's team, which is investigating Russian interference in the 2016 election and any potential ties between the Trump campaign and Russia, \"the most biased group of people.\" \"These people have the biggest conflicts of interest I have ever seen. Democrats \u2014 all. Either Democrats or a couple of Republicans who worked for President Obama,\" Trump said. Mueller is a Republican, and the U.S. attorney for the Southern District of New York was appointed in January. As to whether he would fire Mueller, Trump gave his frequently used \"we'll see what happens\" response, reiterating that he believed that the investigation was \"a pure and simple witch hunt\" that should have been wrapped up long ago. \"Why don't I just fire Mueller? Well, I think it's a disgrace what's going on. We'll see what happens,\" Trump said. The president went on to attack Sessions \u2014 his own appointee \u2014 for recusing himself from the Russia investigation in March 2017. The recusal put Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein in charge of the probe, and he appointed Mueller in May. \"The attorney general made a terrible mistake when he did this and when [he] recused himself or he certainly should have let us know if he was going to recuse himself and we would have put a different attorney general in,\" Trump said. \"So he made what I consider to be a very terrible mistake for the country. But you'll figure that out.\" Cohen's attorney Stephen Ryan argued the FBI had overstepped its bounds in seizing \"privileged communications\" between Cohen and his clients. \"The decision by the U.S. Attorney's Office in New York to conduct their investigation using search warrants is completely inappropriate and unnecessary,\" Ryan said in a statement. He continued: \"It resulted in the unnecessary seizure of protected attorney client communications between a lawyer and his clients. These government tactics are also wrong because Mr. Cohen has cooperated completely with all government entities, including providing thousands of non-privileged documents to the Congress and sitting for depositions under oath.\" Michael Moore, a former U.S. attorney for the Middle District of Georgia, told NPR that for investigators, \"the possibility of evidence destruction is likely at the forefront of their concern.\" \"Remember that they are also gathering evidence and testimony from other sources, so they may already be in possession of corroborating evidence,\" Moore said. \"That's what makes this move in the investigation so interesting. For example, there is a reason that search warrants were issued for the particular locations.\" The FBI, the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York and the special counsel's office declined to comment on the search. Cohen has worked for Trump for many years and is closely tied in with many of his business and personal matters. For example, Cohen has admitted he paid adult film actress Stormy Daniels $130,000 just weeks before the 2016 election. Daniels called that part of a concerted effort to stop her from going public about what she says was a 2006 tryst with Trump. The president denies any liaison with Daniels and denies he knew about the payment. Trump told reporters on Air Force One recently to ask Cohen about it. The president also said he didn't know where Cohen got the $130,000 to give to Daniels. Cohen has said he used his own \"personal funds.\" Cohen also was the point of contact between the Trump Organization and government officials in Russia at a time when Trump wanted to build a Trump Tower in Moscow. Cohen acknowledged sending an email to Russian President Vladimir Putin's personal spokesman to ask about starting discussions about a major new real estate project in the Russian capital \u2014 discussions that Cohen said never got underway.",

            "article_content": "Leaks from Michelle Obama's new memoir, Becoming, are appearing ahead of next week's release date. The former first lady denounces Trump, but spends most of the book telling her own story.  RACHEL MARTIN, HOST: First ladies are famously circumspect about how they weigh in on politics, if they do at all. And it's rare that we hear any of them give opinions about the current occupant of the White House. But President Trump has changed a lot of norms in our politics. And former first lady Michelle Obama does have thoughts about that. She lays them out in her new book. It is called \"Becoming.\" And it goes on sale next week. NPR's Danielle Kurtzleben from our Washington Desk has read the book, and she joins us with a preview. Hey, Danielle. DANIELLE KURTZLEBEN, BYLINE: Hey, Rachel. MARTIN: So I understand Michelle Obama does talk about her own reflections of election night, when she found out along with the rest of us, along with the rest of America that Donald Trump had won that election. KURTZLEBEN: Right. MARTIN: What does she share? KURTZLEBEN: Well, she shares that she was shocked, like a lot of Americans, that Trump won. She, of course, had been, you know, stumping for Hillary Clinton. But she also denounces, you know, Trump's birther campaign. She talks about things well beyond election night. She makes it pretty clear - very clear - that she has heavy contempt for the current occupant of the Oval Office. She talks about how not only was she offended by the birther campaign, where she - where President Trump suggested that, you know, her husband was not born in America but also that she saw it as a threat to her family, that it was enabling, as she says, wingnuts and kooks, that she was afraid that people could come after her children. She was genuinely scared. Aside from that, she talks about her utter fury at the \"Access Hollywood\" tape - that infamous tape where President Trump was caught on tape talking about grabbing women by their genitals. I mean, I do want to be very, very clear here. This is a minuscule sliver of this book that she spends on Trump. It's a handful of pages. It's way at the end. So if you pick this book up and you're expecting a bunch of sick burns against President Trump, that's not what this book is. MARTIN: That's not what this is. KURTZLEBEN: No. MARTIN: I mean, it's a memoir, right? KURTZLEBEN: Absolutely. MARTIN: Like, she hasn't done this before. This is about her life story. KURTZLEBEN: Yes. It's really very much about telling her story, despite the fact that we all know her as the wife of the man who was the most powerful man in the country. If not the world. I mean this is a book about this very accomplished woman saying, you know, hey this is me. This is my story. So we hear about her childhood, her family, her college years. And through all that, we get this deeper sense of who she is then we all got while she was in the White House. We learn that she's driven. She's an obsessively hard worker. She's a planner. She's very Type A - to her husband's, you know, sort of more loosey-goosey way of doing things. And some of the most interesting things about her formative years are her observations on race and class. This is what I found fascinating. She talks about, you know, growing up black and working class on the South Side of Chicago. And then she ends up at Princeton, this very white, very privileged place. So she talks about meeting black students who are more privileged than her to end up in this sort of bubble of very rich, very privileged people. It's all very fascinating. And it's her not just talking about policy. It's her talking about, here are broad American themes. Here's how they have affected me. MARTIN: Right. Anything else stand out to you? I mean, this has been getting a whole lot of hype, this book. KURTZLEBEN: You know, to me, there is a theme that runs throughout the book that I found that really gets very profound. She writes very eloquently about the difficulty of marriage. I mean, writes about going to couples counseling with Barack. She writes about their fertility struggles, about agreeing to let politics hijack their lives. And it's clear she's not trying to be juicy here or, like, to dish. She - you get the sense she's really wrestled with deep questions about what it's like to weave your life in with someone else's. MARTIN: Right. Things that, I mean, so many of us grapple with... KURTZLEBEN: Absolutely. MARTIN: ...Like work of long-term relationships. KURTZLEBEN: Right. MARTIN: NPR's Danielle Kurtzleben, thank you so much for giving us a preview of that book. KURTZLEBEN: Thank you. MARTIN: It's Michelle Obama's new memoir. It is called \"Becoming.\" Copyright \u00a9 2018 NPR.  All rights reserved.

            "article_content": "Donald Trump reimbursed his lawyer Michael Cohen for the hush money paid to adult movie actress Stormy Daniels. Trump legal adviser Rudolph Giuliani made the comment on Fox News Wednesday night.  RACHEL MARTIN, HOST: President Trump is acknowledging a new revelation in the Stormy Daniels scandal. Here's what happened. Last night, the president's new lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, went on Fox News and said that the president reimbursed Michael Cohen for the money that he paid the adult film star Stormy Daniels to keep an alleged affair quiet. Fox anchor Sean Hannity asked Giuliani if Trump knew what that payment was for. (SOUNDBITE OF TV SHOW, \"HANNITY\") SEAN HANNITY: That's what Michael would say. RUDY GIULIANI: He didn't know about the specifics of it, as far as I know. But he did know about the general arrangement that Michael would take care of things like this, like I take care of things like this for my clients. I don't burden them with every single thing that comes along. These are busy people. MARTIN: This morning, President Trump tried to explain further on Twitter what this payment was all about. Joining us now - NPR national justice correspondent Carrie Johnson. Hey, Carrie. CARRIE JOHNSON, BYLINE: Good morning, Rachel. MARTIN: So the president on Twitter this morning trying to explain, he says, that this payment that Cohen made - $130,000 to Stormy Daniels, also known as Stephanie Clifford, her real name - that this was part of a regular retainer that he was paying Michael Cohen, that Cohen paid this money to Stormy Daniels and that the president paid him back, but that the money that he was reimbursed came from just his regular payments to Cohen. JOHNSON: That's right, Rachel. The key point here that Rudy Giuliani was trying to make on Fox last night, and maybe got lost in translation and that Donald Trump once again is trying to make on Twitter this morning, is that money from his campaign or any campaign contributions played no role in this transaction, this alleged hush money payment by Michael Cohen to Stormy Daniels to cover up an alleged affair with Donald Trump. And what they want to say is, this is not a campaign finance violation. There are already watchdog groups out there that have filed complaints with the Federal Election Commission and the Justice Department over this. And what these guys are trying to say is, this is a personal transaction, has nothing to do with campaign finance laws. There are a couple of problems with that including, one, is that Michael Cohen made this payment shortly before the election. But we'll see what happens there. MARTIN: So does this stand in contrast to what the president has said before? Because he has maintained all along that he didn't have this affair. But he has also said that he had no idea about this payment that Michael Cohen made. Now, though, Giuliani and even the president in this tweet suggesting that the payment - he did, in fact, reimburse Cohen for this. JOHNSON: Yeah, Rachel, remember just last month on Air Force One, Donald Trump was asked point blank whether he knew about the payment from Michael Cohen to Stormy Daniels. He said no. He said he didn't know what the source of the funds were. And then he said in response to other questions, ask Michael - ask Michael Cohen. Now the president seems to be suggesting he had more knowledge than he shared with the public just a month ago. Rudy Giuliani is saying that Trump made these payments through a retainer arrangement with Michael Cohen through the course of 2017 after the election. But obviously, folks are going to want to demand proof of that or some kind of documentary evidence. MARTIN: Why does any of this matter? I mean, in particular, does it have any effect on Robert Mueller and the special counsel's investigation? JOHNSON: Well, there are a couple things going on here. One is, remember, Michael Cohen was the subject of major raids in his hotel room, his residence and his business office very shortly - a short time ago. The FBI raided his offices and collected a lot of information. He's in a fight with the government now over what kind of information the government can see. Prosecutors in New York say they are investigating him criminally. So any involvement Michael Cohen may have in an alleged campaign finance scandal would certainly play into part of this investigation. The other thing, Rachel, is that Michael Cohen may have a lot more information about Donald Trump and the Trump campaign that people like the special counsel, Robert Mueller, would want to know. And as the pressure increases on Michael Cohen, he may be more susceptible to wanting to make a deal. So far, he's denied all wrongdoing, said he's not going to flip on the president. But the legal pressure on him is intense, and it's only going to go greater. MARTIN: And briefly, Carrie, we mentioned Rudy Giuliani, new addition to Trump's legal team, but there's someone else. Emmet Flood is in. Ty Cobb, one of the president's lawyers, is out. What does this signify? JOHNSON: Ty Cobb was the primary voice of cooperation with the special counsel inside the White House. Now he's retiring. Instead, the White House is bringing in Emmet Flood, best known for defending President Bill Clinton in his impeachment proceedings and defending other White Houses in claims of executive privilege. Emmet Flood appears to be much more antagonistic toward special prosecutors than Ty Cobb was, and he could be setting up for a fight here. MARTIN: NPR's Carrie Johnson. Thanks so much. JOHNSON: You're welcome. Copyright \u00a9 2018 NPR.  All rights reserved.  Visit our website terms of use and permissions pages at www.npr.org for further information.

Lamar Alexander, R-Tenn., speaks at the unveiling of the official portrait of Tennessee Gov. Bill Haslam. Alexander said Monday he is not running for re-election in 2020. Tennessee Republican Lamar Alexander, one of the few pragmatic dealmakers left on Capitol Hill, is the first senator to announce he won't run for re-election in 2020. \"The people of Tennessee have been very generous, electing me to serve more combined years as Governor and Senator than anyone else from our state. I am deeply grateful, but now it is time for someone else to have that privilege,\" the longtime politician said in a statement. \"I have gotten up every day thinking that I could help make our state and country a little better, and gone to bed most nights thinking that I have. I will continue to serve with that same spirit during the remaining two years of my term.\" Alexander is currently the chairman of the Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee. He worked with his Democratic counterpart, Washington Sen. Patty Murray, on a bipartisan plan to stabilize the Affordable Care Act, though that effort would ultimately fade as the GOP and the White House unsuccessfully tried to push through their own replacement plan last year. .@SenAlexander has been a great partner on so many bipartisan bills\u2014from fixing No Child Left Behind, FDA reform, and more. I'm looking forward to two more years of productive work with him. He has served our country and his state for so many years, and I wish him the best! -PM His exit will also have ramifications for the seniority in the Tennessee delegation, with his colleague Sen. Bob Corker set to retire at the end of the year. The outgoing lawmaker praised Alexander in a statement as \"the legislator of the decade because of the effective way he has worked across the aisle to pass legislation that directly affects the lives of so many throughout our state and around the country.\" One of the highlights of my time in the Senate has been working with @SenAlexander. My full statement on his decision not to seek re-election in 2020: pic.twitter.com/xT4Kl8Gi6J Alexander's retirement just two years after Corker is sure to inspire a crowded GOP primary field to fill his seat. GOP Rep. Marsha Blackburn was elected to succeed Corker last month, following a bitter race against former Democratic Gov. Phil Bredesen. Blackburn's win marked a shift in statewide politics in Tennessee, which has typically elected more centrist lawmakers like Corker, Alexander, Bredesen and current Gov. Bill Haslam. With Bredesen's decisive loss in a hotly contested race, it's unlikely Democrats could mount a real challenge again, and it's a signal the state is moving farther to the right. Possible candidates could include the outgoing Haslam, who passed on a bid to succeed Corker, or incoming Rep.-elect Mark Green, whom the conservative Club For Growth urged to run in a statement. Green, a physician, sparked controversy last week when he claimed without any evidence hat vaccines could cause autism; Alexander later tweeted a video of him from a congressional hearing praising vaccinations, saying they \"save lives.\" Outgoing Rep. Diane Black or businessman Randy Boyd, who both lost in the GOP primary for governor this year, could also mull a run. Alexander has been a mainstay in Tennessee and national politics for decades. First elected governor in 1978, during the campaign he famously walked more than 1,000 miles across Tennessee in what would become his signature red-and-black-checked flannel shirt. After serving two terms, Alexander would go on to become the president of the University of Tennessee and was later chosen by President George H.W. Bush to be his secretary of Education. Alexander ran unsuccessfully for president twice in both 1996 and 2000, and his campaigns never really caught fire. But when Sen. Fred Thompson announced he wouldn't run for re-election to the Senate in 2002, Alexander defeated a conservative challenger in the primary and went on to win relatively easily that fall. He served as chairman of the Senate Republican Conference during his tenure, but he stepped down from that role in 2012 saying he wanted to work more on policy issues across the aisle. He faced a conservative Tea Party-backed primary challenger in 2014 as well, and while he won, he was still held below 50 percent and also lost his home of Blount County.",

Anthony's grave is covered with \"I Voted\" stickers in Rochester, N.Y., on Tuesday. When Susan B. Anthony cast her ballot in the 1872 presidential election, it's fairly safe to say the pioneering suffragist did not receive a sticker declaring, \"I voted.\" Instead of one of those little badges of civic honor, so ubiquitous in U.S. elections these days, Anthony received a pair of handcuffs \u2014 she was arrested for and convicted of voting nearly half a century before women finally won the right to do so. Anthony never lived to see the 19th Amendment adopted. But on Tuesday, some people did their best to repay her sacrifice \u2014 with stickers. Lots and lots of stickers. Beginning early in the morning, women left their polling places and descended on the cemetery where Anthony was laid to rest in Rochester, N.Y. There, in the drizzly gray of autumn, they plastered her gravestone with stickers of red, white and blue. The first people arrive at 7:05am here at Mount Hope Cemetery in Rochester, NY to place their \u201cI Voted\u201d stickers at the grave of Susan B. Anthony.  It was November 5, 1872 when Anthony illegally voted in the presidential election, resulting in her arrest. #ElectionDay @News_8 pic.twitter.com/4yklblxbqY Voting stickers are already starting to pile up at Susan B. Anthony\u2019s gravesite @SPECNewsROC pic.twitter.com/yQ1cEsqfuL \"Because of Susan B. Anthony, we're all out here voting today,\" one woman, who said she was visiting with her daughter, told local media. \"And it's wonderful. It's a privilege to be able to be here.\" The activity is becoming something of a regular Election Day pilgrimage. As voters cast their ballots in the 2016 election, the first in U.S. history to feature a woman as a major party presidential nominee, so many people paid visits to her grave that hours had to be extended at Mount Hope Cemetery. As NPR's Rebecca Hersher pointed out, Anthony was not the only noteworthy suffragist to be commemorated at the time. Elizabeth Cady Stanton and Ida B. Wells, among others, drew tributes of their own as well. This time around, after Hillary Clinton's defeat in 2016, there is no single female nominee inspiring national headlines \u2014 there are scores of them. Across both parties the names of 235 female candidates grace House ballots across the country, while 22 more women have run for the Senate. Those numbers shatter the previous records set in 2012 and 2016.",

            "article_content": "Both major parties are counting on some of their core constituents to turn out and vote on Tuesday. We'll hear from some of those people about what's motivating them this election season.  MICHEL MARTIN, HOST: Now, we started the program hearing about the final days of this very competitive election season. And here is where we want to have a reality check. The fact is, in recent decades, most Americans who are eligible to vote in the midterm elections don't. UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #1: I don't feel like I'm educated enough to follow the politicians. You know, I don't - I just - it's just not my thing. MARTIN: In a few minutes, we're going to hear more about why people say they don't vote. But first, we want to talk about the other people - the people the major political parties are sure will come out - their core constituencies, often referred to as the base. We were traveling across Pennsylvania last week. We met people who met that description. For the Democrats in many parts of the country, that means black women. They are known to work hard for candidates they support, network like crazy and, most of all, show up on Election Day, which perfectly describes three women we met in Philadelphia who became friends through their membership in The Links. Founded in Philadelphia in the 1940s, it now boasts some 15,000 members across the country, all women of color who are dedicated to community service and very committed to staying informed about the issues. The group is nonpartisan, but individual members are certainly free to express their opinions, which they did when they gathered at the home of Terri Dean in Northwest Philadelphia. She was on the phone organizing a voter education program for college students even as she was laying out sandwiches, cookies and fruit for us and fellow Links members Mariska Bogle and Leah Smith Sheppard. And, when they finally sat down, they told us why they never miss a chance to vote. TERRI DEAN: Because it's my civic duty and because our ancestors died for this right - for us to be able to vote - and because I do believe that my vote counts. MARTIN: You do believe that. DEAN: ...Collectively with others, obviously. But I do believe my vote is my voice. MARTIN: And, Mariska, what about you? Do you vote routinely? Do you... MARISKA BOGLE: I vote routinely. And I... MARTIN: You are going to vote this time. BOGLE: ...Agree in the fact that my ancestors did die fighting for the right to vote - and women as well - not just my ancestors, but women. So it's my duty, and that's why I do vote. Does my vote count? I am not so sure it does. I have some challenges with the Electoral College. And so that's one of my - thinking of how we need to look at that differently. But it's what I should do, and I do it. MARTIN: Leah, what about you? Do you vote and routinely and... LEAH SMITH SHEPPARD: I do vote routinely. I grew up going into the voting booth with my parents, so I really don't know any different from elementary school all the way through, you know, high school. My parents were divorced, so sometimes I'd go with my dad, sometimes I went with my mom. But we always went. So it was like getting a driver's license. I couldn't wait 'til it was my turn to go in and push my own buttons or whatever. So yeah, that is something that I do, something that I'm committed to do. And, like Terri, I go every time. MARTIN: Are you all interested in this election - just talking about the midterm election coming up? I mean, one of the - it's interesting to talk to you all because you all vote no matter what. But do you sense a lot of interest in this election, perhaps unusually so? Anybody? SHEPPARD: Sure. It's a bit of shock and awe after 11-9 or 11-8 or whatever we're saying now about 2016. I think people were in a bit of shock, and I think that people are seeing that, you know, maybe they never paid that much attention to the midterms, but they realize that people's terms can end. You can actually effectively vote someone out of office. MARTIN: We've noted earlier that African-American women have become understood to be a key part of the Democratic constituency, right - for example, the special election in Alabama. There are analysts who give African American women credit for winning that election for Doug Jones. And I just wanted to ask, do you think your concerns are being addressed? DEAN: Part of me says my concerns are no different than anybody else's concerns. I'm concerned about criminal justice reform. I'm concerned about the disproportionate negative treatment of men of color. And I don't feel those concerns are being addressed. I think they're being talked about, but I don't think they're being addressed. And I've seen the treatment of African-American men in this country when I've seen issues of education, you know, being denied adequate funding for education in the public schools. You know, which is - those are where our kids benefit the most. And I don't see it happening yet, but I have faith that, at some point, it will have to happen because if we continue to exercise our power and flex our muscle and own the fact that we as African-American women are moving this needle forward for the Democratic Party, then yeah - we will start to see some progress being made. MARTIN: Leah, what about you? SHEPPARD: I do not feel that the issues are being addressed. One of my issues is health care reform. And I'm a cancer survivor, so it was very important to me to know that the next - when I'm ready to retire or the next job I take or whatever that I'm not going to be declined from any insurance or health care because I have a preexisting condition. And I feel like, over the past, you know, two to four years, the conversations on the Republican side have been more about really dismantling the legacy of President Obama and just stripping away anything that has to do with, quote-unquote, Obamacare as opposed to hearing the concerns of people in rural America, suburban America, in the inner cities. Most people are saying the same things about health care, but I feel like Washington isn't listening. MARTIN: Well, that seems kind of a bummer, though. I mean - but so - but you all don't seem bummed out. I mean, you're - what you're saying is you really don't... SHEPPARD: Keep hope alive. MARTIN: ...Feel very good about... SHEPPARD: (Laughter) Keep hope alive. MARTIN: ...Where - so what is keeping hope alive? Because - is it just your personality? Is it just... SHEPPARD: I think what's keeping hope alive is that we believe a change is going to come. We feel like we are going through a season right now but that we will come out of it. And it will take deliberate action, decisive behavior. And I think it will take motivation for people to stay involved and stay focused and be engaged. But we are in a season of change. And I think we stay positive because we understand what happens when you go through the wilderness and come out on the other side. MARTIN: Then we headed to Chapman, Pa. It's rural, about two hours from Philadelphia. The population there is less than 200 people and, according to the latest census, it's more than 98 percent white. And that's where we met Dottie Niklos. DOTTIE NIKLOS: I'm just Dottie. And, in this area, there's no last name for me. It's just, have you seen Dottie? MARTIN: She is an active member of the Northhampton County Republican Committee, and it shows. Her front lawn is crowded with signs for local Republicans running in all sorts of races. There are more signs stacked in the driveway. UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #2: You've got enough yard signs, you think? I don't think you have enough. NIKLOS: Oh, well, I have a few more in the garage. UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #2: You have a few more in the garage. How are you? MARTIN: And when we step inside her home filled with family heirlooms, another spread awaits. Homemade pumpkin roll cookies and hot coffee are laid out in the dining room while Fox News plays in the den. And, just like the ladies we met in Philadelphia, Dottie always votes. MARTIN: Because it's my country, and it's my duty, and it's a privilege, and there's so many people in the world that don't get to choose their leaders. MARTIN: Dottie is joined by her friends Judith Ladonis (ph) and Sandra Dech (ph). I asked Dottie and Sandra about their biggest concerns in advance of the election, and the answers are very different from the ones we heard back in Philly. NIKLOS: National security, including terrorism, immigration and the rule of law in the country. MARTIN: And what about you, Ms. Sandra? SANDRA DECH: And I'm strongly against socialism, so I feel I have to vote for the candidate that is more for a free United States. There is a billboard on 22 - two billboards with Gov. Wolf's picture and a socialist Pennsylvania. MARTIN: Sandra is referring to a billboard paid for by Republican candidate Scott Wagner. It implies falsely that the Democratic candidate is running as a socialist. Like a lot of people we spoke to in Pennsylvania, these ladies told us that the tone of the politics in the U.S. concerns them. They say President Trump wasn't their first choice in 2016, but they came around once he started implementing policies they support. So I asked them how they feel when President Trump says things like this. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: So if you see somebody getting ready to throw a tomato, knock the crap out of them, would you? Seriously. (CHEERING) TRUMP: OK? Just knock the hell - I promise you I will pay for the legal fees. I promise. I promise. MARTIN: OK, but how do you square Mr. Trump's own conduct during the - starting in the campaign where he was encouraging people to beat up protesters saying he'd pay their legal bills, more people need to be body-slammed... NIKLOS: I never heard that. MARTIN: ...Just last - you never heard that? NIKLOS: Never heard that. MARTIN: You never heard that. NIKLOS: And I watch... MARTIN: OK. NIKLOS: ...Watch all kinds of channels. MARTIN: Do you really? OK. NIKLOS: Yes. MARTIN: OK, well - OK. But... NIKLOS: And I read all kinds of websites, but I never saw that. DECH: Would you rather have a polished politician who's not doing what you want? Or would you rather have one who's not a polished politician, who is a businessman who just says what he wants? Maybe there's some things I wish he would kind of, you know, use a little more tact on. But otherwise, he's getting the job done. MARTIN: Ms. Dottie? NIKLOS: I see mobs in the street. And I see what they did to Brett Kavanaugh - where his children had death threats and had to be taken to school in an armoured van. They did $10,000 worth of damage to his house. He couldn't take his family to church. Michelle Obama, God bless her, she said, when they go low, we go high. Well, now, all of a sudden, it's the opposite. It's, when they go low, we kick them. MARTIN: As you've heard, the ladies echoed some of the talking points that Republican candidates and their surrogates have been making on the campaign trail, even repeating some debunked stories, like the point about Brett Kavanaugh's house being damaged by left-wing protesters. That's not true. But it led me to ask about the #MeToo movement that was brought up during that contentious confirmation hearing and has been mentioned as a motivating factor for some women to cross party lines to vote for Democrats in 2018. NIKLOS: My thought is that women can take care of themselves. They don't have to hate men. I have been approached in inappropriate ways. I've decked a few men. I'm a retired chef. I've decked a couple of waiters. MARTIN: And you had sharp knives, too. NIKLOS: Well, they thought they could... MARTIN: And fire. NIKLOS: They thought they could pinch me, and I just turned around, and that was - you come back at them strong. And, no, I have been approached with, would you like to have this promotion? Not at that price. MARTIN: So you're saying you don't understand it - like, why... NIKLOS: I don't - no. My theory is that the feminist movement at one time was very important because women were being held down. I think women have complete largesse today. They can go where they want. They can do what they want. They can get an education. They can take care of their families. We can stay home with our children if we want. We can do that. We can take a year off. We can do whatever we want. I'm really not into women running around with those silly pink pussy hats on. What does #MeToo mean? It's me. It's not us. It's not for the better good. It's for me - me too. MARTIN: So that's not a factor in your thinking for... NIKLOS: My... MARTIN: ...In choosing a candidate. NIKLOS: You know, my factor is what's good for my country, what's good for the family, what's good for my community. I may be crazy, but I think that it's just a community. And if we're all - if we're all pulling for ourselves and working together, we're going to be successful. MARTIN: Ms. Judith, any thoughts about #MeToo? Does it factor into your thinking politically at all? JUDITH LADONIS: It really does not. I have known a lot of women who have been victims, and I've also known a lot of women who have been humiliated into dropping charges and, you know, and that sort of thing. And they have my complete sympathy with that. But I'm not very comfortable with unlimited times to prosecute people. But I don't know enough about it to make a good decision on it.

Top Democrats say that if they take control of the House, they'll focus on investigating \u2014 not impeaching \u2014 President Trump.\n                \n                    \n                    Toya Sarno Jordan/Getty Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption House Judiciary Committee Ranking Member Jerry Nadler talks with Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi. Top Democrats say that if they take control of the House, they'll focus on investigating \u2014 not impeaching \u2014 President Trump. For many Americans, \"impeachment\" could become the term du jour if Democrats take control of the House in next week's midterm election. But party leaders say they want to focus on a different I-word: investigations. Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi and her lieutenants say they want to embrace the significant oversight powers that Democrats would gain in the majority. Those include subpoenas and public hearings, which Democrats could use to hamstring the Trump administration by dragging in senior officials for testimony and keeping alleged wrongdoing \u2014 large and small \u2014 in the public eye. Three committees in particular \u2014 oversight, Judiciary and intelligence \u2014 are poised to lead the charge. Ranking members Reps. Elijah Cummings, D-Md., of oversight, Adam Schiff, D-Calif., of intelligence and Jerry Nadler, D-N.Y., of Judiciary, have chafed under Republicans' control of their committees. \"This country has a number of emergencies right now under the jurisdiction of this committee which we're not spending any time or any attention [on] \u2014 the leading one obviously being the fact that 3,000 children were improperly taken away from their families,\" Nadler said this summer. Judiciary Committee Chairman Rep. Bob Goodlatte, R-Va., convened what turned into a contentious, 10-hour hearing in July featuring Peter Strzok, the FBI agent who sent private, anti-Trump text messages while working on the Russia investigation. Nadler was not impressed. \"It's of more immediate concern than this hearing, certainly,\" he said. The Democratic leaders say they have dozens of subpoena requests in hand and investigative leads they want to follow. Becoming chairmen in January would permit them to move ahead. Cold front A new barrage of oversight investigations that would follow a Democratic takeover of the House would mark a jarring change for the White House. For the past two years, President Trump has enjoyed a Republican-controlled House and Senate. That has translated into GOP-led investigations aimed largely at the FBI and others investigating Russia's election interference, not at the Trump administration itself. In the case of the House intelligence committee under its current Republican chairman, Rep. Devin Nunes of California, the panel concluded its Russia investigation with a finding of no wrongdoing by Trump or his campaign. GOP control of Congress also allowed the president's allies to push back against the Russia investigation with counternarratives \u2014 such as an anti-Trump \"deep state\" conspiracy theory, of which Strzok is a star. At the same time, Republican allies used their House majority to exert pressure on those involved in the Justice Department's Russia probe, for example, by repeatedly threatening to hold in contempt the man overseeing the investigation, Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein. Republicans defend their oversight record, particularly as it pertains to the Russia probe. Four FBI officials, including the onetime director and the bureau's deputy director, have been removed, and both the FBI and Justice Department have dragged their feet in supplying information they owe to Congress, Goodlatte and others argue. \"They're going to have to add more lawyers\" Is the White House prepared for the possibility of Democrats taking control of the House? Multiple requests for comment were declined on the grounds that administration officials don't want to talk about something they hope doesn't happen. \"Yes they are prepared,\" said Ty Cobb, who until this year was the lawyer handling the special counsel investigation. \"Are there people prepared for that? Yes there are,\" he told CNN. \"They're going to have to add more lawyers.\" For starters, the lawyer in the Trump White House who had been handling oversight requests, Uttam Dhillon, left over the summer to become acting administrator of the Drug Enforcement Administration. No replacement has been announced. White House Counsel Don McGahn left last month before his named replacement could get security clearance. So a lawyer named Emmet Flood is in the role temporarily. Flood has a lot of experience dealing with these very issues in past administrations, but it's not clear whether he would do that for President Trump. Neil Eggleston, who served as White House counsel for President Barack Obama, knows what it's like to deal with an opposition party in control of Congress. He also worked in the Clinton administration, which was under endless investigation. \"When the subpoenas start coming, they start coming pretty fast and furious,\" he told NPR. \"Congress puts a lot of pressure on to respond quickly and it is quite vocal in the press about failure to respond quickly and so there is a lot of pressure on the White House counsel's office.\" Administration officials must balance their legal obligations to comply with their political desires to protect themselves and the presidency. Former Attorney General Alberto Gonzales, who was White House counsel to President George W. Bush, told NPR that one strategy is to negotiate as much as practical to avoid subpoenas and avoid having to exert executive privilege. That's the doctrine that can permit a president to shield internal documents from Congress and the public \u2014 but one that can also come with a political cost. \"You burn political capital every time you assert privilege,\" Gonzales said. \"Immediately your opponents in congress, the media will say 'What are you hiding? You know \u2014 why are you asserting privilege?'\" The gentleman from Maryland House intelligence committee Ranking Member Adam Schiff (left) and oversight committee Ranking Member Elijah Cummings have a lot they want to tackle if they become chairmen.\n                \n                    \n                    Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption House intelligence committee Ranking Member Adam Schiff (left) and oversight committee Ranking Member Elijah Cummings have a lot they want to tackle if they become chairmen. The main investigative arm of the House is traditionally the Committee on Oversight and Government Reform. The top Democrat, Cummings, has managed to prod the administration even while in the minority. In his biggest splash, Cummings made public a number of documents that raised question about the finances and foreign contacts of Michael Flynn, Trump's first national security adviser, who resigned after less than a month on the job. Flynn has since pleaded guilty to lying to the FBI and is cooperating with special counsel Robert Mueller's Russia investigation. If Democrats win the House, Cummings says that as oversight chairman, he would focus on the basics. \"The waste, fraud, and abuse is plain to see,\" he said. \"The most important thing for the oversight committee to do is to get back to regular order by obtaining documents and interviewing witnesses, and actually holding the Trump administration accountable to the American people.\" The committee, he said, needs to look into day-to-day issues for most Americans, such as access to health care, voting rights, the cost of prescription drugs, postal system reform and questions about the census. Cummings and his fellow Democrats on the committee say they have more than 60 subpoenas that Republicans have blocked since Trump's inauguration. If they claim the gavel, Democrats plan to tap into that stash come January. Democrats on the Judiciary Committee, meanwhile, also have topics on which they plan to dig, given the chance. Those include the FBI's supplemental background investigation of Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh and a potential question of perjury; the firings at the FBI; the administration's hard-line immigration policy; and the Justice Department's decision not to defend the Affordable Care Act from constitutional challenges. The spy game The intelligence committee, meanwhile, is likely to resurrect aspects of its Russia investigation. Republicans closed the probe in March with no finding of any connection between Trump's campaign and the Russian war of disinformation against the West. Democrats rejected the GOP's conclusions as well as the decision to shut down the investigation. They say Republicans conducted a halfhearted probe that refused to pursue investigative leads, compel testimony from witnesses or subpoena critical documents. \"We will do an assessment of the work remaining and the questions still unanswered in the Russia investigation,\" Schiff said. \"We are determined to provide a full accounting of Russia's interference in the last election as both parties promised at the outset but the GOP later abandoned.\" There are other threads that Democrats want to look into that they believe will help uncover the full picture of Russia's interference and influence operation during the 2016 election. That includes, one congressional source said, questions about whether the Trump campaign used data that was improperly acquired, as well as allegations that the Trump Organization may have been used as a conduit for money laundering. That, in turn, blends into questions surrounding the president's finances, which is a topic that Democrats are primed to investigate. The chief target on this front is the president's tax returns. Trump, despite much public criticism, has broken precedent and refused to release his tax returns, effectively shielding his finances from scrutiny. That could end with committee gavels in the hands of Democrats, who could request those documents and put them under a public microscope. That power would rest with the House Ways and Means Committee under a tool called the \"committee access\" provision.",

Editor's note: This column contains a racial epithet. One day in the 1930s, a very young Martin Luther King Jr. was sitting in the passenger seat of his father's car when his dad accidentally ran a stop sign on a Georgia street. \"A policeman pulled up to the car and said: 'All right, boy, pull over and let me see your license,' \" King remembered in an essay years later. \"My father replied indignantly, 'I'm no boy.' Then, pointing to me, 'This is a boy. I am a man, and until you call me one, I will not listen to you.' \" The officer was so flummoxed that he quickly wrote out the traffic ticket and hurried away. Some years later, when King was a civil rights activist writing from a Birmingham, Ala., jail cell, he would point to that word \u2014 boy \u2014 as one of Jim Crow's ritual humiliations, braided into the racial etiquette of the post-slavery South. It was yet another way \u2014 like withholding simple courtesies like honorifics \u2014 that white people weaponized language to remind black folks of their place. The slight was unmistakable. If manhood was the precondition for the actualization of rights, \"boy\" denied that status even to other men who might lay claim to it. In a region steeped in manners and terms of deference, no black man was ever old enough to age out of \"boy\"; no white person was ever too young to toss it in his direction. \"Boy\" shows up again and again, if implicitly, in the language of black resistance to white oppression. \"Think about those video reels and the black-and-white photos of black men during the civil rights marches with sandwich boards or placards saying 'I Am A Man',\" the Bucknell linguist Hiram Smith said. There's an old urban legend, Smith added, in which black Jazz Age musicians began using \"man\" as a term of affection \u2014 as in, \"What's happening, man?\" \u2014 as a rebuke to \"boy.\" If childhood is a time of innocence that warrants protection, then that stage of life ends much earlier and more abruptly for black boys. So was \"boy\" a slur? That was a central question of a sprawling employment discrimination suit in Alabama, which began in 1996 and didn't end until 2016. In that case, a black plant worker argued that his white supervisor had called him \"boy\" as he barked orders at him. For two decades, a series of juries and judges \u2014 and eventually the Supreme Court of the United States \u2014 repeatedly disagreed over what the supervisor meant when he said it. At one point, some of Martin Luther King's contemporaries in the civil rights movement filed an amicus brief on the plaintiff's behalf, hoping to make the point clear: \"If not a proxy for 'nigger,' it is at the very least a close cousin.\" Unlike that close cousin, of course, \"boy\" has usages that are not irradiated by race, which provides a lot of plausible deniability for the times when it most certainly is. (The plaintiff eventually won.) But the echoes of that more sinister denotation remain. Just this past spring, an organization of black journalists urged The Associated Press to adopt new guidelines on \"boy, saying that it felt the term was being used too cavalierly in news stories, especially ones about police violence against black males. Swirling around that legitimate concern about applying \"boy\" to describe fully grown black men is a growing body of evidence that lays out the ways that actual black boys have been gerrymandered out of the very notion of boyhood. If childhood is a time of innocence that warrants protection, then that stage of life ends much earlier and more abruptly for black boys. Research backs this up. In a study from 2014, psychologists asked police officers to look at photographs of boys between the ages of 10 and 17. The officers were told, at random, that the boys in the pictures were suspected of either a petty crime or a felony. Then the participants were asked to guess the ages of the boys in the photos. The officers consistently perceived black boys as older than they were \u2014 by an average of 4.5 years. Those black boys were seen as legal adults when they were a little over 13 years old. (In the same study, the officers saw white boys in the photographs as younger than they actually were.) This aging up of black boys has serious consequences, the study's authors said, including making it more likely that black boys would have force used on them in police encounters. \"Our research found that black boys can be seen as responsible for their actions at an age when white boys still benefit from the assumption that children are essentially innocent,\" one of the researchers wrote. Those findings line up with other studies that have found that black boys are more likely to be tried by prosecutors as adults in criminal proceedings and more likely to be sent to adult prisons. Even in early childhood, black boys face tougher consequences for for their actions than do white boys of the same age. The Yale researcher Walter Gilliam wrote that being either \"big, black or boy\" was the biggest predictor of whether a child was suspended or expelled from preschool. White boys \u2014 particularly those who are better-off \u2014 enjoy that presumption of childhood innocence until much later in life, and it's a distinction that has apparently always been baked into the very notion of adolescence. Back in the 1890s, G. Stanley Hall, the first president of the American Psychological Association, championed the then-novel idea of a distinct developmental stage between childhood and adulthood, according to Ashwini Tambe, a professor of women's studies at the University of Maryland. \"He imagined it as a stage of storm and stress and turbulence and sexual experimentation,\" she said. But Tambe noted that Hall and his contemporaries imagined this phase of necessary recklessness for those like themselves: male, white, educated and affluent. In his seminal 1904 book, Adolescence, Hall wrote that \"[a] period of semicriminality is normal for all healthy boys ... those whose surroundings are bad will continue it, but others will grow away from it as they approach maturity.\" Practically speaking, this period of constructive delinquency was not on the table for poor children of all races who couldn't put off adult responsibility because they needed to work or for white girls of similar privilege, as they were expected to be better-behaved. And so: \"Boys will be boys;\" \"Saturdays are for the boys;\" \"the old boys' club.\" Brock Turner. Ethan Couch. Cameron Terrell. And, of course, the recent debate over the newest Supreme Court justice. During Brett Kavanaugh's confirmation hearings, in which he faced accusations that he committed a sexual assault in high school, he leaned into the particulars of his prep school life \u2014 barbells, basketball, beer, bro'ing out \u2014 as if the mere fact of them was exculpatory. (Try to imagine a black man accused of sexual violence trying to convince people that his routine underage drinking should get him off the hook.) And in their defenses of him, many of Kavanaugh's supporters quite literally imagined their own male children as future Brett Kavanaughs \u2014 promising, upstanding men who might one day have their good names ruined by scheming women and too-credulous presumptions about their guilt. It's a defense not readily available to everyone. Kavanaugh, after all, was nominated by a man who once took out newspaper ads that called for the death penalty for five boys of color accused of a brutal rape. The boys were 14, 15 or 16 years old at the time of their arrests and tried as adults; the newspapers covering the story broke from convention by naming the accused minors and prominently running their photos. When they were exonerated by DNA evidence decades later, Donald Trump continued to argue that the five now-grown men should never have been cleared. \"These young men do not exactly have the pasts of angels,\" Trump wrote. Their pre-prison pasts, though, were essentially their childhoods. Whether a black male is treated as a \"boy\" or a \"man\" has so often depended on which of those categories might invite the most consequence. White men of means, though, are seldom too old to have aged out of the benefit of the doubt.",

            "article_content": "Voter suppression claims have popped up all over ahead of the midterm elections. There's special scrutiny in Georgia where the man in charge of implementing voting laws is also running for governor.  MARY LOUISE KELLY, HOST: We are here to talk to voters and to keep tabs on a battle over voting rights that is playing out in different parts of the country but maybe nowhere as contentiously as here in Georgia. So let me bring you straight here to ground zero of that battle. I am inside the state Capitol right under the famous gold dome and right in front of the door that belongs to Brian Kemp. He is Georgia's secretary of state. He is also the Republican candidate for governor, which means he is running in the same election that he is in charge of refereeing, an election in which a lot of Georgians maybe aren't going to be able to vote because in his role as secretary of state, Brian Kemp has overseen a purge of the voter rolls here. Well, we've got Johnny Kauffman of member station WABE. I asked him to meet us at the Capitol. Hey there. Thanks for coming. JOHNNY KAUFFMAN, BYLINE: Hello. KELLY: So it seems like the battle lines are so stark here. You have Brian Kemp - white, Republican - overseeing, as we said, the removal of voters. His opponent, Stacey Abrams - black, Democrat - has made trying to get people to turn out and vote the centerpiece of her whole campaign. And now this week, we've got the courts weighing in. What's the latest? KAUFFMAN: The latest is a ruling from a federal judge over some absentee ballots that were essentially thrown out by one county in particular a large number. And the judge has ruled that the voters in that situation need to have more time to review their ballots to challenge them being thrown out and to actually have a chance to vote. But that's just really, like, one part of a number of controversies that have gone on. You mentioned the purges. In some of my reporting along with AP and reports in the podcast Reveal, we found that in 2017, there were about 100,000 voters removed from the voter list because they hadn't voted and hadn't responded to some notifications from the state. KELLY: The use it or lose it policy that's on the books. KAUFFMAN: Yeah, this is a policy that's in a few states. It's very controversial. So there were those purges. There's a policy called exact match that Secretary Kemp has implemented that freezes applications if there's just a tiny mistake in the voter registration application, if it doesn't match other government databases. That pending list which we've reviewed shows that that program flags a disproportionate number of people of color. KELLY: People who Stacey Abrams is trying to capture the votes of. KAUFFMAN: Exactly. KELLY: OK, so do we have any way to put a number on this? Potentially how many people are we talking who might want to vote on Tuesday, who might not be able to vote on Tuesday? KAUFFMAN: It's hard to say exactly because registering to vote doesn't necessarily mean that you're going to vote. But with the purge - there's a hundred thousand people there, something around 40,000 on this pending list. So we're talking tens of thousands of people who may show up at the polls on November 6. They may be turned away or deal with some other problem that discourages them, and they decide to go home. KELLY: OK, so let me bring in the voices of our two protagonists here. Brian Kemp says he's just trying to conduct an orderly election, that he is following the law. Here's Kemp speaking at a debate last week. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) BRIAN KEMP: Voters should look at the numbers and know that this is all a distraction to take away from Ms. Abrams' extreme agenda that she has. And we're having record turnouts right now. And this farce about voter suppression and people being held up from being on the rolls and being able to vote is absolutely not true. KELLY: So that's Brian Kemp. Meanwhile, his critics, with Stacey Abrams leading the charge, argue that he is purposely making it harder for people to vote. Here's Abrams at that same debate. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) STACEY ABRAMS: Voter suppression isn't only about blocking the vote. It's also about creating an atmosphere of fear, making people worry that their votes won't count. As the next governor of Georgia, I will work with the secretary of state to ensure that there is no question that the right to vote in Georgia is not a privilege. It is indeed a right that belongs to those who are Georgia citizens. KELLY: Johnny Kauffman, is she right? I mean, this has been a point of tension here, whether voting is a right or whether voting is a privilege. KAUFFMAN: It's pretty clear right now in Georgia that voting is a privilege. The Republican-controlled Legislature has erected a number of additional obstacles to people voting in the name of combating voter fraud. There are some individual cases of voter fraud here in Georgia that have been prosecuted, but there's no widespread voter fraud. And so when we talk about is voting a right or a privilege in that debate, really it's also part of this larger debate between Republicans and Democrats in the state. Should we open up voting more and make it easier to vote, or should we be more concerned about the integrity of voting and who's able to vote, making sure that nobody's voting illegally? KELLY: That's a fascinating window into what is at stake in the vote here on Tuesday, which prompts me to ask. How tight is this race? How's it looking? KAUFFMAN: It's very close. The polls are showing right now that both candidates are just a little bit under 50 percent, which means that this race could go to a runoff. KELLY: And meanwhile, early voting is in full swing. I know you have been down at the early voting stations talking to voters. What are they telling you? KAUFFMAN: I went to a few different early voting locations to talk to folks and see what's going on. And at the first polling place I went to, I spoke with somebody named Edwin Adams. And he's black. He lives in Atlanta. And he actually brought up this issue of voter suppression without me asking about it. And he thinks that Kemp is doing this for a particular reason. EDWIN ADAMS: I just feel like this is a Republican state. It should not even be close. You know what I'm saying? So I feel like the reason he's doing that is 'cause he's scared. KAUFFMAN: And what you couldn't hear in that tape is Edwin's mom behind him, who had some more choice words for Kemp that we can't put on the radio. KELLY: Oh, choice as in unbroadcastable (ph)... KAUFFMAN: Yes. KELLY: ...Words on public radio. OK, now meanwhile, what are Kemp supporters telling you? KAUFFMAN: I met one woman named Jo Campbell. She's from Sandy Springs, which is a suburb of Atlanta. And she really feels like Democrats are making a bigger deal out of these voter suppression allegations than what is actually going on. Here's what she said. JO CAMPBELL: They can take something I think and make it more of a mountain than it is depending on if it suits their need. Both sides, both parties are guilty of this. KAUFFMAN: And I thought it was really interesting to hear her say that. She said she would be concerned if there is voter suppression going on, and she would be concerned if people's ballots were rejected because their signature didn't match. But she thinks Democrats are using this to motivate their supporters to go to the polls and cast ballots for Stacey Abrams. KELLY: Reporter Johnny Kauffman of member station WABE giving us the latest on the governor's race and claims of voter suppression here in Georgia. Thanks so much. KAUFFMAN: Thanks for having me. ARI SHAPIRO, HOST: And, Mary Louise, you were out at an early voting station this morning, right? Was there a long line? KELLY: I was. There were no lines when we stopped by. We were at a voting station in Fulton County. But the onsite manager came out and said, you got to come back because tomorrow is the last day of early voting. And she said, we're expecting lines, lines, lines. It's going to be busy. There was - can I tell you about this one moment of joy this morning? SHAPIRO: Please. KELLY: I started chatting with a woman who just voted. Desiree Andrews, 38 years old, voted for the very first time today. She told me, here I am; I'm lending my voice. Well, and how'd it feel today lending your voice... DESIREE ANDREWS: Oh, my God (laughter). KELLY: ...On the ballot for the first time? ANDREWS: It felt amazing (laughter). I was very anxious to start with. SHAPIRO: She's almost giddy there. KELLY: She's giddy. She said she grew up - her family didn't vote when she was a kid, so she just had no window into the process. She was intimidated. And she said, today's the day. It is time. Collectively, we all got to get off the bench. SHAPIRO: Our co-host Mary Louise Kelly hosting from Atlanta today. Thanks, Mary Louise.

Special counsel Robert Mueller has reportedly dropped his insistence that President Trump appear in person to answer questions related to potential coordination his 2016 election campaign and Russia, agreeing instead to accept written responses. The New York Times first reported on a letter sent Friday to the White House by Mueller making the offer. It comes after months of wrangling over whether Trump would or would not sit for an interview with the special counsel. \"On another significant aspect of the investigation \u2014 whether the president tried to obstruct the inquiry itself \u2014 Mr. Mueller and his investigators understood that issues of executive privilege could complicate their pursuit of a presidential interview and did not ask for written responses on that matter, according to the letter, which was sent on Friday,\" the Times reported. NPR has not independently confirmed the details reported by the Times and various other news outlets. Although, the Times reports that Mueller \"did not say that he was giving up on an interview.\" The Associated Press, reporting separately and citing a person familiar with the letter, said Mueller's office \"indicated it would later assess what additional information it needs from the president, leaving open the possibility that Mueller's team might still seek answers on obstruction-related questions in an in-person interview.\" Rudy Giuliani and Jay Sekulow, the president's personal attorneys, declined comment, as did a representative for the special counsel's office, according to The Washington Post. In appearances on television news programs, Giuliani has frequently discussed Mueller's pursuit of an interview with the president, seeming to wax and wane about the likelihood and desirability of such an interview. As the Post notes, \"Mueller's decision to accept at least some written responses represents a concession to Trump's legal team, which since December has resisted the special counsel's efforts to interview the president. In March, Mueller raised the prospect of subpoenaing Trump if he refused to be questioned voluntarily.\" The AP writes, \"The move by Mueller comes after he has issued two lengthy indictments detailing Russian efforts to interfere in the presidential campaign. Mueller has also scrutinized a June 2016 meeting at Trump Tower between Donald Trump Jr. and a Russian lawyer he believed to have derogatory information on Democrat Hillary Clinton. Trump Jr. took the meeting, emails show, after it was described as part of a Russian government effort to help his father's campaign. Trump has said he knew nothing about the meeting before it happened.\"",

Updated at 1:35 p.m. ET White House counsel Don McGahn is resigning this autumn after a tumultuous stretch as President Trump's in-house lawyer. Trump announced the departure on Twitter on Wednesday morning. White House Counsel Don McGahn will be leaving his position in the fall, shortly after the confirmation (hopefully) of Judge Brett Kavanaugh to the United States Supreme Court. I have worked with Don for a long time and truly appreciate his service! One likely candidate to replace McGahn is Emmet Flood, who joined the president's legal team in May to focus on the Justice Department's Russia investigation. White House press secretary Sarah Sanders said on Wednesday morning that Trump likes McGahn and that they have a \"good relationship. There's not really a lot to add here.\" Another person close to the White House, however, who asked not to be identified, said that Trump couldn't stand McGahn and openly complained about him to other White House aides. Flood was brought in to serve as McGahn's successor and that transition might already have happened but for Supreme Court Justice Anthony Kennedy's retirement, the person said. McGahn convinced Trump to let him stay on to manage the process of selecting and then helping confirm a replacement. Of Flood, Sanders said, \"People like him. He's super-well-respected around the building, but there's not a plan locked in place at this point. He hasn't been offered. That's not where we are. So we'll keep you posted on a personnel announcement.\" The person close to the White House told NPR that Flood makes good sense to take over as White House counsel in view of the ongoing Justice Department investigation. \"Emmet has the skill set. He's handled these things before,\" the source said \u2014 but added that with Trump, nothing is a done deal until it is done. The president is likely hearing from outside advisers who may try to convince him to choose someone else. It wasn't clear on Wednesday whether that might mean Flood would step down too if he is passed over or whether he might stay within the administration in a subsidiary role to another new White House counsel. The news about McGahn's resignation disappointed at least one important stakeholder outside the White House: Iowa Sen. Chuck Grassley, the Republican chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee. \"I hope it's not true McGahn is leaving WhiteHouse Counsel. U can't let that happen,\" Grassley responded on Twitter. @realDonaldTrump   I hope it\u2019s not true McGahn is leaving WhiteHouse Counsel. U can\u2019t let that happen A spokesman for Grassley later issued a statement to NPR softening his position. \"Senator Grassley has appreciated Mr. McGahn's work over the last two years and has considered him integral to the president's record-breaking success on filling judicial vacancies,\" he said. \"From Senator Grassley's perspective, there's not been any White House Counsel who has worked so well and so efficiently with the chairman's office and the Senate Judiciary Committee on judges.\" Ticking clock Indications about McGahn's departure had been growing recently and his days appeared numbered after a New York Times report detailed McGahn's extensive cooperation with special counsel Robert Mueller's investigation into obstruction of justice and possible collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia. According to the report, McGahn spoke with Mueller's team about some of the key events of concern to the Russia inquiry, including Trump's firing of FBI Director James Comey, his push for Attorney General Jeff Sessions to take over the investigation from Mueller and his attempts to fire the special counsel. The story sparked a series of angry tweets from Trump, saying he encouraged McGahn to cooperate with Mueller. But Trump's personal lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, appeared to know little about what McGahn said in his approximately 30 hours of interviews. Giuliani told NPR on Wednesday that McGahn's departure doesn't have anything to do with his interviews with Mueller's investigators since the president had known about them for months. Important insider McGahn drew criticism early on in the Trump administration for poorly crafted executive orders, which in some cases were struck down by the courts. But the White House lawyer has left a lasting mark on the federal judiciary, spearheading the president's successful push to pack the bench with conservative judges. McGahn, a combative former member of the Federal Election Commission, served as Trump's campaign lawyer. After Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia died in 2016, McGahn, along with the conservative Federalist Society, drew up a list of conservative judges from which Trump promised, if elected, to choose Scalia's successor. The White House pulled out that list of judges again in June when Supreme Court Justice Kennedy announced his retirement. McGahn has ushered Trump's replacement pick, Judge Brett Kavanaugh, through meetings with senators before his September nomination hearings. Kavanaugh is expected to be confirmed and on the high court in time for its October term. It is not clear precisely when, but between now and then, McGahn will depart the White House. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., told Time magazine the list of possible judges was a key selling point for a lot of social conservatives, \"given [Trump's] own background, which was far from, shall I say, ideologically consistent.\" It was McConnell, of course, who preserved a vacancy on the high court by blocking a Senate vote on President Barack Obama's nominee to replace Scalia, Merrick Garland. McConnell used similar tactics to hold dozens of seats open on the lower courts. As a result, Trump found more than twice as many vacant federal judgeships when he entered the White House as Obama had. He promptly set about filling them, with McGahn's help. McConnell lamented McGahn's resignation in a statement on Wednesday, calling it \"sad news for our country.\" McGahn's \"significance to the judiciary, the White House and the nation cannot be overstated,\" McConnell said. The White House counsel ran a clearinghouse for nominees, fielding suggestions from local lawyers and politicians as well as conservative advocacy groups like the Federalist Society and the Heritage Foundation. Trump nominated Neil Gorsuch to replace Scalia during his second week in office. In addition, the president has so far installed 26 appeals court judges and 33 district judges. Dozens of additional nominations are pending. A few of the nominees hit roadblocks. Matthew Petersen withdrew his nomination after questioning by Sen. John Kennedy, R-La., revealed an embarrassing lack of basic legal knowledge. Others were tripped up by inflammatory past statements. But McGahn wasn't looking for inoffensive middle-of-the-road judges. As Time magazine reported, he told the Federalist Society last November that he wanted judges who were \"too hot for prime time ... The kind of people that make some people nervous.\" \"An iconoclast\" That unconventional style drew criticism in other areas, including McGahn's own legal work for the president. \"McGahn is reportedly 'an iconoclast bent on shaking things up,' \" Jack Goldsmith wrote on the Lawfare blog early in McGahn's tenure. \"Unfortunately for the president, that is not an attractive quality in a White House counsel, whose main job is to ensure that the president and the White House steer clear of legal and ethical and related political problems.\" Early versions of the president's travel ban, on people from several mainly Muslim countries, were struck down by the courts. Judges also blocked an executive order that aimed to punish so-called \"sanctuary cities.\" However, in a major win for the administration, the Supreme Court ruled in June that the ban was \"squarely within the scope of Presidential authority.\" McGahn was also warned just days into the Trump presidency about concerns surrounding the president's first national security adviser, Michael Flynn. Acting Attorney General Sally Yates informed McGahn less than a week after the inauguration that Flynn had misled the vice president and other administration colleagues about his contacts with Russian officials. There are conflicting accounts of what McGahn did with that information. But it was only after Yates' warning became public that Flynn was fired. He has since pleaded guilty to lying to the FBI. McGahn also beat back an effort by the president to fire special counsel Mueller in June 2017. Trump backed down after McGahn threatened to quit rather than order the Justice Department to dismiss Mueller. The move was first reported by the New York Times. McGahn's departure had been anticipated since Flood joined the president's legal team. Flood helped represent President Bill Clinton during his impeachment hearings. He also worked in the White House counsel's office during the George W. Bush administration. McGahn could return to his lucrative career as a partner in the Jones Day law firm, while also doing work for Trump's re-election campaign. He may also find more time for music. McGahn previously served as lead guitarist and occasional keyboard player in Scott's New Band. NPR correspondents Carrie Johnson and Ryan Lucas contributed to this report.",

            "article_content": "President Trump responds to an article suggesting a White House lawyer is cooperating with Special Counsel Robert Mueller.  LAKSHMI SINGH, HOST: We're going to start the program today with politics because President Trump is reacting strongly and angrily to a report in The New York Times that Don McGahn, who is the White House counsel - we should note not one of Trump's personal attorneys, the White House counsel - that Don McGahn has been cooperating with special counsel Robert Mueller's investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election. The story suggests McGahn might be talking because he's worried that Trump might be setting him up to take the blame for any possible obstruction. President Trump responded in a tweet storm from Bedminster, N.J., where he's been spending the weekend. NPR White House correspondent Tamara Keith joins us now to explain all of this. Hello, Tam. TAMARA KEITH, BYLINE: Hello. SINGH: All right. So let's briefly recap this New York Times story for our audience. What did it say? And what are the implications of the story? KEITH: You got at the main headline there - that Don McGahn, the White House counsel, has spent some 30 hours, according to The New York Times, talking to the investigators who are part of Robert Mueller's special counsel team, and that - according to this article, felt that he needed to basically speak for himself to avoid being thrown under the bus by the president. I asked McGahn's attorney about this, and he gave me a statement. His name is William Burke. He says, President Trump through counsel declined to assert any privilege over Mr. McGahn's testimony. So Mr. McGahn answered the special counsel's team's questions fulsomely and honestly as any person interviewed by federal investigators must. The upshot here is that the president's lawyers didn't stop McGahn from talking to the special counsel team - didn't say, he's an attorney and we have attorney-client privilege - didn't exert executive privilege either. SINGH: Yeah, and he's basically - President Trump has basically been saying as much in his tweets. KEITH: That's correct. And there have been a lot of them. I will - there were a couple that stand out. He says, the failing New York Times wrote a fake piece today implying that because White House counsel Don McGahn was giving hours of testimony to the special counsel, he must be a John Dean-type rat. But I allowed him and all others to testify. I didn't have to. I have nothing to hide. I guess this is the point at which we explain who John Dean is. SINGH: Yeah because one thing that stands out, like you said, is Trump's reference to John Dean, who was President Nixon's White House counsel during Watergate who ultimately cooperated with prosecutors to Nixon's detriment, as you know. KEITH: Yes, exactly. And one thing that we learned from the Watergate experience was that - or what was settled by it is that the White House counsel represents the presidency, not the person. The White House counsel is not the president's personal lawyer. In fact, the president's personal lawyer - or one of many of them, Rudy Giuliani - was on \"Meet The Press\" today. And he insisted in that appearance that the president means it when he says that he encouraged McGahn to testify. He says that was the legal strategy of President Trump's previous legal team. And Giuliani says that that was the strategy because they thought that it would get the investigation over with more quickly. (SOUNDBITE OF TV SHOW, \"MEET THE PRESS\") RUDY GIULIANI: I guess if I had known the outcome, that Mueller would not conclude it quickly, that this really wasn't an attempt in good faith to try to work out some resolution of this, I might have chosen a different strategy. I'm pretty sure they would have. But be that as it may, it puts us in a very strong position to say we don't - they don't need to question them. SINGH: So while McGahn has been meeting with the special counsel Robert Mueller, President Trump's lawyers, including Rudy Giuliani, still have not agreed to when or how the president himself might be questioned, right? KEITH: That's right. And that's sort of what Giuliani was getting at at the very end of that clip, where he says, well, we've got a pretty good case that we don't need to talk to him. And what he means is that Giuliani and the president's other lawyers really don't want him to talk to Mueller. The president himself has sort of hedged on that and has indicated that he'd like to if they can work it out. But they've been trying to work this out for months and months and months. And it's seeming less and less likely as time goes on. And one reason that Giuliani told \"Meet The Press\" that he didn't want to have the president testify is because he considers it to be a perjury trap. (SOUNDBITE OF TV SHOW, \"MEET THE PRESS\") GIULIANI: And when you tell me that, you know, he should testify because he's going to tell the truth, that he shouldn't worry - well, that's so silly because it's somebody's version of the truth, not the truth. He didn't have a conversation... CHUCK TODD: Truth is truth. I don't mean to go, like... GIULIANI: No, it isn't truth. Truth isn't truth. KEITH: So that has gotten a lot of reaction understandably. I think what Giuliani was trying to say is that the president may say one thing. James Comey, the former FBI director, may say something else. What is truth anyway? SINGH: So all this is happening while we are still following Mueller's prosecution of Paul Manafort. That's Trump's former campaign chairman. Where does that stand? KEITH: It is in the hands of a jury. They recessed on Friday and have taken the weekend off understandably. They resume on Monday. We don't know how long it will take, but there are a lot of counts that are being considered and just piles of evidence that were presented to the jury that they are now trying to sort through and make a decision about whether he is guilty beyond a reasonable doubt or not guilty. SINGH: NPR White House correspondent Tamara Keith. Thank you very much, Tam. KEITH: You're welcome. Copyright \u00a9 2018 NPR.  All rights reserved.

In a series of tweets over the weekend, President Trump responded to a story published in The New York Times that detailed extensive cooperation between White House counsel Donald McGahn and the inquiry by special counsel Robert Mueller into obstruction of justice and possible collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia. In a tweet Saturday night, Trump said he allowed and encouraged McGahn's cooperation with the special counsel. \"In addition we readily gave over one million pages of documents. Most transparent in history,\" Trump wrote. I allowed White House Counsel Don McGahn, and all other requested members of the White House Staff, to fully cooperate with the Special Counsel. In addition we readily gave over one million pages of documents. Most transparent in history. No Collusion, No Obstruction. Witch Hunt! Sunday morning, Trump continued tweeting, affirming he had \"nothing to hide...\" The failing @nytimes wrote a Fake piece today implying that because White House Councel Don McGahn was giving hours of testimony to the Special Councel, he must be a John Dean type \u201cRAT.\u201d But I allowed him and all others to testify - I didn\u2019t have to. I have nothing to hide...... The Failing New York Times wrote a story that made it seem like the White House Councel had TURNED on the President, when in fact it is just the opposite - & the two Fake reporters knew this. This is why the Fake News Media has become the Enemy of the People. So bad for America! The New York Times reported that McGahn spoke with Mueller's team about Trump's firing of the FBI director James Comey and his push for Attorney General Jeff Sessions to claim oversight of the inquiry, and Trump's attempts to fire Mueller. His interviews with Mueller's team of investigators totaled 30 hours. Trump's team of personal lawyers had initially instructed McGahn to cooperate with Mueller with the goal of bringing the investigation to an end as quickly as possible, and with the premise that the president had nothing to hide. According to The New York Times, McGahn became increasingly concerned about Trump's encouragement of his interviews with the special counsel, and feared Trump was setting him up to take the fall for possible illegal acts. The New York Times reports: \"Mr. McGahn and his lawyer, William A. Burck, could not understand why Mr. Trump was so willing to allow Mr. McGahn to speak freely to the special counsel and feared Mr. Trump was setting up Mr. McGahn to take the blame for any possible illegal acts of obstruction, according to people close to him. So he and Mr. Burck devised their own strategy to do as much as possible to cooperate with Mr. Mueller to demonstrate that Mr. McGahn did nothing wrong.\" While McGahn says he never saw Trump go beyond his legal authorities, the Times says he gave investigators a mix of information both \"damaging and favorable\" to the president. It remains unclear if McGahn answered questions on collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia. Michael Beschloss, a presidential historian, says McGahn's cooperation with the special counsel is reminiscent of John Dean, White House counsel under President Nixon, who was eventually fired by Nixon during the Watergate scandal. Beschloss told The New York Times, \"This sure has echoes of Richard Nixon's White House counsel, John Dean, who in 1973 feared that Nixon was setting him up as a fall guy for Watergate and secretly gave investigators crucial help while still in his job.\" On Saturday, Dean tweeted that McGahn is doing the right thing. McGahn is doing right! https://t.co/qqzhZRAFlY In an interview with Slate, Dean said: \"Don McGahn is doing exactly the right thing, not merely to protect himself, but to protect his client. And his client is not Donald Trump; his client is the office of the president. That is one of the things that was cleared up as a result of Watergate. The American Bar Association reissued a code of ethics and dealt directly with representation of an organization, and who the client is. And the client, in this instance, would not be the man who holds the office, but the office. And that is a huge difference.\" McGahn's lawyer, William Burck, gave a statement to NPR on McGahn's reaction to the Times report: \"President Trump, through counsel, declined to assert any privilege over Mr. McGahn's testimony, so Mr. McGahn answered the Special Counsel team's questions fulsomely and honestly, as any person interviewed by federal investigators must.\" In a statement to the Times, White House press secretary Sarah Sanders said, \"The president and Don have a great relationship. He appreciates all the hard work he's done, particularly his help and expertise with the judges, and the Supreme Court.\" In an interview with NBC News' Meet the Press on Sunday, Giuliani said he has reservations about Trump sitting for an interview with Mueller. Giuliani said, \"Look, I am not going to be rushed into having him testify so that he gets trapped into perjury. And when you tell me that, you know, he should testify because he's going to tell the truth and he shouldn't worry, well that's so silly because it's somebody's version of the truth. Not the truth.\" \"Truth is truth,\" Todd said. \"No, it isn't truth. Truth isn't truth,\" Giuliani said. \"The president of the United States says, 'I didn't ... ' \" \"Truth isn't truth?\" Todd replied, adding, \"This is going to become a bad meme.\" Giuliani continued, \"Donald Trump says. 'I didn't talk about Flynn with Comey.' Comey says, 'You did talk about it,' so tell me what the truth is.\" Trump's personal legal team has urged the special counsel to wrap up its investigations by the the midterm elections this fall, and Trump has maintained his innocence through the duration of the inquiry, calling the Mueller investigation a \"witch hunt.\"",

On Tuesday, he reconfirmed he would not run.\n                \n                    \n                    Aaron P. Bernstein/Getty Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption Sen. Bob Corker, R-Tenn., said in September that he would not seek re-election, but then he wavered. On Tuesday, he reconfirmed he would not run. Sen. Bob Corker, R-Tenn., will not run for re-election this year \u2014 for real, this time. Corker had been waffling in recent weeks over his decision in September to retire and admitted he was considering jumping back into the race. Running would have set up a bruising primary fight with Tennessee Rep. Marsha Blackburn, the front-runner in the Republican primary, who announced her candidacy after Corker said he wasn't going to run. But on Tuesday, Corker's chief of staff, Todd Womack, confirmed that the senator's initial decision will indeed stand and that he will not seek a third term: \"Over the past several months, Senator Corker has been encouraged by people across Tennessee and in the Senate to reconsider his decision not to seek re-election. Based on the outpouring of support, we spent the last few days doing our due diligence and a clear path for re-election was laid out. However, at the end of the day, the senator believes he made the right decision in September and will be leaving the Senate when his term expires at the end of 2018. When he ran for the Senate in 2006, he told Tennesseans that he couldn't imagine serving for more than two terms because he has always been drawn to the citizen legislator model and believes public service should be missional. This has been the greatest privilege of his life and he is forever grateful to the people of the Volunteer State for the opportunity to serve our state and country.\" Reports surfaced earlier this month that the Senate Foreign Relations Committee chairman was rethinking his choice to step aside. Corker spokeswoman Micah Johnson said in a statement two weeks ago that \"people across Tennessee have reached out to Senator Corker with concerns about the outcome of this election because they believe it could determine control of the Senate and the future of our agenda. The senator has been encouraged to reconsider his decision and is listening closely.\" Some Republicans in the state who are close to Corker told NPR that there was some concern that if the more conservative Blackburn won the primary, the seat from the typically solid GOP state could be in jeopardy. Democrats have recruited former Gov. Phil Bredesen to run; Bredesen earned a reputation as a moderate during his two terms from 2003 until 2011. Corker's allies also asserted that when the senator made his decision last fall, it was in the heat of a feud with President Trump. While Corker had once been a vocal ally of the president, their relationship began to deteriorate and the senator began voicing concerns of Trump's approach to foreign policy and what he viewed as reckless tweets from the president, saying he was putting the country \"on the path to World War III.\" At one point, Corker called the White House \"an adult day care center.\" Some Tennessee Republicans argued that Corker has since mended fences with Trump and that would help him if he did run again. They maintained that Corker would easily beat Bredesen, while Blackburn would put the critical seat \u2014 which could help determine control of the Senate \u2014 in play. However, Blackburn has been one of the most successful GOP Senate candidates so far in fundraising, ending 2017 with almost $5 million in her campaign coffers. In addition, Tennessee has moved far to the right since Bredesen was last on the ballot over a decade ago. Some national Republicans were fretting that if Corker did decide to run again, a difficult primary could hurt whomever the party's nominee was come November. And given how Corker's standing had fallen in the Volunteer State after his row with the president, he could have been an underdog against Blackburn, a Tea Party darling. Amid reports that Corker was reconsidering his retirement, Blackburn's campaign made clear she wasn't going anywhere even if the incumbent did decide to run again \u2014 and argued that efforts to push her out of the race reeked of misogyny. \"Anyone who thinks Marsha Blackburn can't win a general election is just a plain sexist pig,\" Blackburn spokeswoman Andrea Bozek said in a statement on Feb. 13. \"She's the best fundraiser in the country and is beating Phil Bredesen in several polls. We aren't worried about these ego-driven, tired old men. Marsha has spent her whole life fighting people who told her she wasn't good enough, and she will do it again.\" With Corker reconfirming he won't run again on Tuesday, Blackburn struck a more conciliatory tone. \"I want to thank Senator Corker for his dedicated service on behalf of Tennessee families,\" Blackburn said in a statement. \"Now, we can unify the Republican party and focus on defeating Democrat Phil Bredesen in November.\"",

            "article_content": "Emanuel's decision comes as the trial of a police officer charged with the murder of a black teenager is about to begin, and as his city struggles with violent crime and a mountain of pension debt.  DAVID GREENE, HOST: Mayor Rahm Emanuel shocked Chicago when he said yesterday that he will not run for re-election next year. The former congressman and Obama White House chief of staff has served two terms as mayor, but it was far from certain that he would win. Here's NPR's David Schaper. DAVID SCHAPER, BYLINE: Rahm Emanuel has long had a reputation as a ferocious campaign animal, someone who eats, drinks and breathes politics. In fact, he'd already raised $10 million for his re-election bid and, at 58, seems far from being ready to retire. So it shocked many here when Emanuel announced at Chicago City Hall that, after two terms, he would not seek a third. (SOUNDBITE OF PRESS CONFERENCE) RAHM EMANUEL: This has been the job of a lifetime, but it is not a job for a lifetime. SCHAPER: Standing next to his wife, Amy Rule, and holding hands, an emotional Emanuel noted that all three of their children are now away at college. (SOUNDBITE OF PRESS CONFERENCE) EMANUEL: We look forward to writing the next chapter in our journey together. SCHAPER: Emanuel gave no reason for leaving a job some predecessors held for decades, but his first 7 1/2 years in office have hardly been smooth sailing. A bitter teachers strike in 2012, the closing of 50 schools the very next year and persistent gun violence in some neighborhoods led many residents to sour on his tenure. Instead of cruising to re-election in 2015, Emanuel was forced into a runoff by a progressive county commissioner. Later that year, police violence again roiled the city after a judge forced the Emanuel administration to release dashcam video of a white police officer shooting and killing 17-year-old Laquan McDonald. (SOUNDBITE OF PROTEST) UNIDENTIFIED PROTESTERS: (Chanting) Rahm, resign, Rahm, resign. SCHAPER: Protests calling for Emanuel to resign have been frequent ever since. LAURA WASHINGTON: People in many parts of the city believe that he was engaged in a cover-up, that he hid the videotape and hid the circumstances of that shooting until he was re-elected. SCHAPER: Jury selection in the trial of the police officer charged with McDonald's murder is set to begin today. And Chicago Sun-Times columnist Laura Washington says for many here, the tense police community relations underscore that affluent areas of the city have thrived under Emanuel, while the city's impoverished neighborhoods on the south and west sides still struggle WASHINGTON: The tale of two cities has haunted him since he came into office. He's never been able to be in a position where both sides of the city - the rich and the poor, the privileged and the left-out - have felt that he represents all of them. SCHAPER: Across the city, many Chicago residents say they're surprised by Emanuel's announcement, but some are not disappointed. RANDALL STARR: I'm happy he's not seeking re-election. SCHAPER: Thirty-two-year-old graphic designer Randall Starr lives on Chicago's south side but works downtown, where he says... STARR: It's beautiful (laughter). SCHAPER: Doesn't he deserve some credit for that? Or do you feel... STARR: For that, yeah, but then if you go further south, there's so much stuff going on that is not being addressed. SCHAPER: Now that Emanuel is out, the race for Chicago mayor is wide open. JACK LAVIN: It's a big moment. We're at a crossroads. SCHAPER: Jack Lavin heads the Chicagoland Chamber of Commerce. He gives Emanuel high marks for improving education, expanding O'Hare Airport and for investing in transit and infrastructure. LAVIN: I think Mayor Emanuel has done a lot of good things for the city to attract jobs, attract businesses, including corporate headquarters, and to make sure that we're developing our talent. SCHAPER: Lavin says such investments will play a crucial role for the next mayor as he or she tackles poverty, violent crime and the uneven economic opportunity that still divides Chicago into what many here say is two very different cities.

Bush speaks with space shuttle astronauts in 1981. Since his death on Friday at the age of 94, George H.W. Bush has been remembered for his decades in the public eye as a congressman, diplomat, CIA director, vice president, and of course, president. His death has also brought about countless remembrances of Bush's more private side, and his life as a husband, father, grandfather and friend. These stories have offered new \u2014 and sometimes surprising \u2014 insights into the character of the nation's 41st president, and some of the hobbies, people and events that shaped him. As the nation prepares to mark four days of ceremony in memory of Bush, we look back at a few of the more unexpected sides of his life. Russian President Boris Yeltsin throws a horseshoe while playing the game outside the White House Oval Office with then-President George Bush in 1992.\n                \n                    \n                    David Ake/AFP/Getty Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption Russian President Boris Yeltsin throws a horseshoe while playing the game outside the White House Oval Office with then-President George Bush in 1992. Tossing horseshoes John F. Kennedy had sailing. Barack Obama had basketball. For George H.W. Bush, it was horseshoes. Bush was a member of the National Horseshoe Pitchers Association, and his affinity for the game was so strong, he had horseshoe courts installed at the White House and Camp David. He once shared a game with Russian President Boris Yeltsin, and when Queen Elizabeth II and Prince Philip visited the U.S. in 1991, they brought with them a special gift for the president: a silver-plated horseshoe set. \"He was competitive. If you tried to play horseshoes with him and you'll see how competitive he can be,\" Colin Powell, who served as Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff under Bush, told NPR. White House visitors would learn that lesson the hard way. In 1992, Bush hosted the Washington Redskins to celebrate their win in that year's Super Bowl, and as mlb.com reported, the team stayed late into the night playing a loud, and competitive game of horseshoes. \"The horseshoe tournament came down to two players against President Bush and his partner, a Secret Service agent,\" former team general manager Charley Casserly told the site. With the game on the line, the final throw came down to President Bush. \"We're thinking, `Wow, there's some pressure on the president,\" Casserly said. \"Then it hits us what we've just said. Pressure? Are you kidding me? This guy knows what real pressure is.\" Casserly said the president \"threw a ringer to win the tournament...No one believes the story, but I was there. It happened.\" George H.W.

The ballplayer Baseball was a lifelong love affair for Bush, who credited his playing days at Yale with helping him succeed in both politics and in life. \"I know in politics, it helps to be competitive and it helps to learn about sportsmanship and practice sportsmanship,\" Bush told Sports Illustrated in 2007. \"So I found that my modest baseball career at Yale was extraordinarily helpful to me when I got into politics or got out into life in business.\" Bush wasn't half bad. In 76 games at Yale, he had a batting average of .224 with one home run, according to the Society of American Baseball Research. It was at Yale where Bush, who was affectionately known by his teammates as \"Poppy,\" met a living legend of the game: Babe Ruth.

Bush's passion for baseball continued well past college. In the summer of 1984, Bush, by then the vice president, played in and old-timers' game, and managed to hit a single into left-center field off of former major league pitcher Milt Pappas. As president, Bush kept his first-baseman's mitt from college in a drawer in the Oval Office. He is also credited with being the first commander-in-chief to throw out the ceremonial first pitch of a Major League Baseball game from the mound \u2014 before that, his predecessors tossed it from a front-row seat in the stands. After losing re-election in 1992, he became a fixture at Houston Astros games alongside his wife, Barbara Bush. She would keep a scorebook, and he would mingle with fans, players and coaches. It was in Houston where Bush made his last public appearance on a baseball diamond \u2014 when he accompanied his son during the ceremonial first pitch for Game 5 of the 2017 World Series. The skydiver As a young pilot in the Navy during World War II, Bush's plane was hit by Japanese ground fire during a bombing run, forcing him to bail out over the Pacific Ocean. It was hardly the last time he would leap from a plane. Skydiving became a hobby for Bush, one that he used to mark his 75th, 80th, 85th and 90th birthdays. In all, Bush took eight jumps over the course of his life, his office told USA Today in 2014. Former U.S. President George H.W.

The morning of his final jump, on his 90th birthday, began with a tweet from Bush. \"It's a wonderful day in Maine \u2013 in fact, nice enough for a parachute jump.\" After a serenade of \"Happy Birthday\" by his family, Bush leaped from 6,000 feet harnessed to Sgt. 1st Class Mike Elliott, a retired member of the army's elite Golden Knights parachute team. \"It's vintage George Bush,\" his spokesman, Jim McGrath, told Fox News at the time. \"It's that passion for life. It's wanting to set a goal, wanting to achieve it. I'm sure part of it is sending a message to others that even in your retirement years you can still find challenges.\" An unlikely friendship If there was one person who helped shape the public perception of George H.W. Bush, for better or for worse, it was the comedian Dana Carvey. As an SNL cast member in the late eighties and early nineties, Carvey's impression of Bush was legendary. And even though the impression cast Bush as a \"buttoned-down WASP, the out-of-touch man,\" as historian Jon Meacham told NPR in a 2015 interview, the president never held grudge. Rather, Bush embraced the impression, and over the years, struck up an unlikely friendship with Carvey. After losing the 1992 election to Bill Clinton, Bush invited Carvey to the White House to roast him in front of his staff. Explaining the key to his impression, Carvey told the crowd: \"Start out with Mister Rogers \u2013 'It's a beautiful day in the neighborhood' \u2013 then you add in a little John Wayne...you've got George Herbert Walker Bush.\" \"Dana has given me a lot of laughs,\" Bush told the audience in the East Room that day. \"The fact that we can laugh at each other is a very fundamental thing.\" In an interview earlier this year with Conan O'Brien, Carvey recalled how the first couple invited him and his wife to spend time with them before the event. \"I've never really seen a marriage that was that effortless,\" he said. \"They were so much fun together.\" \"We had so many warm moments with them,\" Carvey said of the friendship that developed after Bush left the White House. Over the years, Carvey said, Bush would even write to him during important moments in his life. \"It was a different time. It wasn't scorched-earth angry politics.\" In a statement on Saturday, Carvey said, \"It was an honor and a privilege to know and spend time with George H.W. Bush for over 25 years. When I think of those times, what I remember most is how hard we would laugh.\" \"I'm a sock man.\" Former President George H. W.

W. Bush wears red stripped socks as he sits in a wheelchair during an event in the East Room at the White House, July 15, 2013. In 2007, Bush was diagnosed with a form of Parkinson's disease that would eventually diminish his ability to walk and leave him almost entirely reliant on wheelchairs and scooters to get around. As a result, his daughter Doro Bush Koch explained in the book My Father, My President, Bush's ankles were always visible: \"Whether he was greeting runners at the Houston Marathon, or attending the unveiling for George and Laura's White House portraits, or recently going to visit the Houston Texan cheerleaders, Dad has taken to wearing socks that can only be described as eye-catching \u2013 bright pink, black and yellow stripes, stars and stripes, every color and pattern under the sun. The louder, the better. Dad hopes people don't think 'this old boy is getting a little strange.' Brandishing colorful socks is simply his way of making the best of his mobility situation and still finding the joy in life.\" Over the years, his sock selections became viral sensations. He wore socks with American flags on them, socks with the Superman logo, socks encouraging Americans to vote. In 2013, he wore a pair of socks with his own face on them while accepting an award from the Lyndon B. Johnson Foundation. And last spring, in a final tribute to his wife, Bush wore book-themed socks to the funeral of his partner of 77 years, to commemorate her commitment to family literacy programs.",

The former attorney general under President George W. Bush is voicing doubt about whether President Trump has the authority to appoint Matthew Whitaker as acting attorney general, saying there are \"legitimate questions\" about whether the selection can stand without Senate confirmation. In an interview with NPR, Alberto Gonzales, who served as attorney general from 2005 to 2007, also said that critical comments made by Whitaker about Robert Mueller's investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election \"calls into question his impartiality.\" Gonzales's comments add to a chorus of criticism that has faced the Whitaker appointment since Jeff Sessions announced on Wednesday that he was resigning as attorney general at the request of the president. In selecting Whitaker, who served as chief of staff to Sessions, the president passed over the official who had been in charge of the Mueller probe, Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein. \"I've got some issues with this, quite frankly, because the notion that the chief of staff who is not Senate confirmed would have more experience, more wisdom and better judgement than someone like the deputy attorney general or even the solicitor general, people in the line of presidential succession within the Department of Justice, to me, it confounds me,\" Gonzales said in an interview Saturday with NPR's Michel Martin. The Whitaker appointment has fueled uncertainty about the future of the Mueller investigation, with many Democrats now urging the former U.S. attorney and Division I football player to recuse himself from overseeing the probe. Those concerns stem from comments made by Whitaker before he joined the Justice Department last year. In an op-ed for CNN, Whitaker argued that the Mueller investigation had gone too far. He also told the network that he could envision a scenario where Sessions is replaced with an attorney general who \"reduces [Mueller's] budget so low that his investigation grinds to almost a halt.\" In a separate interview last year with the Wilkow Majority on SiriusXM radio, Whitaker opined on the Mueller investigation, saying, \"The truth is there was no collusion with the Russians and the Trump campaign ... There was interference by the Russians into the election, but that is not the collusion with the campaign.\" Addressing Whitaker's past statements, Gonzales said he questioned \"whether or not putting Mr. Whitaker in this position at this particular time was the wise move.\" Even if the appointment is lawful, Gonzales said, Whitaker's comments raised \"a whole specter of whether or not he should recuse himself, so again, we're right back in the situation where you've got the leadership at the department subject to questioning as to whether or not they can effectively lead the department with respect to one of the most politically charged investigations that's ongoing right now.\" On Friday, President Trump responded to criticism that he appointed Whitaker in order to rein in the investigation, saying he has not spoken to him about the probe. The president also said, \"I don't know Matt Whitaker,\" even though he has met with him more than a dozen times. In October, President Trump also told Fox News, \"Matt Whitaker's a great guy. I mean, I know Matt Whitaker.\" Adding to the concerns of Democrats is Whitaker's ties to a witness in the Mueller investigation: Sam Clovis. In 2014, Whitaker chaired Clovis's campaign for Iowa state treasurer. Clovis went on to work as an adviser to the Trump campaign, and is believed to be one of the campaign officials who spoke with another aide, George Papadopoulos, about overtures Papadopoulos was getting from Russians in London. The Washington Post, citing \"two people close to Whitaker,\" reported on Thursday that the new acting attorney general has no intention to recuse himself from the Russia investigation. In a statement on Wednesday, Whitaker said he is \"committed to leading a fair Department with the highest ethical standards, that upholds the rule of law, and seeks justice for all Americans.\" As NPR's Miles Parks and Philip Ewing reported this week, there are multiple ways Whitaker would be able to complicate Mueller's work: One is simply by declining to continue to pay the investigators or attorneys working for the special counsel. Or by re-assigning them back to their previous jobs in the FBI and the Justice Department or the intelligence community. Another way is by constraining the authority that Mueller and his office have to conduct the investigations they want. ... When the special counsel's office wants to issue a subpoena or send investigators or call witnesses before a grand jury, the deputy attorney general is often involved. If the new leadership at the Justice Department didn't want to go along, however, that could constrain Mueller's ability to investigate as he sees fit. And, if nothing else, having an attorney general who isn't recused from Mueller's work might give the White House a clearer look inside it. Gonzales said he was unsure of what could be done if Whitaker moved to stop the Mueller investigation. Such a dramatic step is sure to trigger a fight between Congress and the executive branch about access to what Mueller has so far found, he said. \"The [Justice] Department may simply assert privilege based on law enforcement privilege to protect the integrity of the investigation and to encourage honest dialogue between investigators and prosecutors. Whether or not that privilege would be upheld in the court remains to be seen,\" he said. But Gonzales said it shouldn't have to come to that. \"I'm extremely troubled that a change may have been made here to stop an investigation, which by all accounts is almost complete,\" he said. \"I think we just wait and let this thing play out, let Bob Mueller write his report and let the American people know what actually happened here.\" The audio version of this story was produced by Dana Cronin and Ammad Omar.",

Acting Attorney General Matthew Whitaker could make life quite difficult for Justice Department special counsel Robert Mueller if he wanted. The biggest question in Washington is: Will he? The acting head of the Justice Department took over on Wednesday from former Attorney General Jeff Sessions, who was forced out after months of verbal abuse by President Trump. ....We thank Attorney General Jeff Sessions for his service, and wish him well! A permanent replacement will be nominated at a later date. \"It is a true honor that the President has confidence in my ability to lead the Department of Justice as Acting Attorney General,\" Whitaker said in a statement Wednesday evening. \"I am committed to leading a fair Department with the highest ethical standards, that upholds the rule of law, and seeks justice for all Americans.\" Of Sessions, Whitaker added he \"has been a dedicated public servant for over 40 years. It has been a privilege to work under his leadership. He is a man of integrity who has served this nation well.\" Whitaker was Sessions' chief of staff and so he'll step into the job with a nearly complete working knowledge of the department \u2014 except for Mueller's investigation. That's because Sessions had recused himself, calling it inappropriate that he lead an inquiry into Trump's 2016 presidential campaign of which he was a part. Mueller is looking into whether anyone on that campaign might have conspired with the Russians who attacked the 2016 election. Now, though, Sessions is gone and the Justice Department says that means Whitaker's purview includes the special counsel's investigation. Whitaker has not been a fan. \"Mueller has come up to a red line in the Russia 2016 election-meddling investigation that he is dangerously close to crossing,\" Whitaker wrote in an op-ed last year before he came to work for the government. He called for Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, who appointed Mueller and who has been supervising his work, to curb the investigation. Now Whitaker is in charge of the Justice Department and Rosenstein reports to him, putting Whitaker in a position to constrain the special counsel if he wishes or if he's directed to do so by the president. \"A hoax\" Trump has made clear that he believes he has the power to fire Mueller altogether, through the leadership of the Justice Department or outside it. The president's lawyers have argued he has vast privilege under the Constitution to hire or dismiss nearly anyone within the executive branch. Trump asserted that again on Wednesday in a press conference at the White House in which he suggested the only reason he hasn't already ousted Mueller is because it might make him look bad. Mueller's inquiry is a \"hoax,\" the president said, and asked why, if it's supposed to find \"collusion\" between his campaign and the Russians, it hasn't found any. \"I could fire everybody right now,\" Trump said. \"But I don't want to stop it because politically, I don't like stopping it.\" If that stands, there are other ways that Trump and a newly simpatico attorney general could complicate Mueller's work. One is simply by declining to continue to pay the investigators or attorneys working for the special counsel. Or by re-assigning them back to their previous jobs in the FBI and the Justice Department or the intelligence community. Another way is by constraining the authority that Mueller and his office have to conduct the investigations they want. Rosenstein, for example, has explained to Congress how closely he supervises the work done by Mueller and his team. When the special counsel's office wants to issue a subpoena or send investigators or call witnesses before a grand jury, the deputy attorney general is often involved. If the new leadership at the Justice Department didn't want to go along, however, that could constrain Mueller's ability to investigate as he sees fit. And, if nothing else, having an attorney general who isn't recused from Mueller's work might give the White House a clearer look inside it. The new acting attorney general or whoever serves as his fulltime replacement could simply brief Trump and his aides on where the special counsel is focused if the president doesn't know already. The special counsel's office declined to comment Wednesday after Sessions' resignation. Whitaker so far hasn't said much about his outlook for the Justice Department or the special counsel investigation; Rosenstein hasn't spoken publicly either since Sessions' dismissal. Critics, however, are calling on Whitaker not to take the reins. Democrats cited his past comments about Mueller as evidence that he too must recuse. \"Given his record of threats to undermine & weaken the Russia investigation, Matthew Whitaker should recuse himself from any involvement in Mueller's investigation,\" House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., said on Twitter. \"Congress must take immediate action to protect the rule of law and integrity of the investigation\" Given his record of threats to undermine & weaken the Russia investigation, Matthew Whitaker should recuse himself from any involvement in Mueller\u2019s investigation. Congress must take immediate action to protect the rule of law and integrity of the investigation. #FollowTheFacts Pelosi is set to become speaker of the House when Democrats are seated with their new majority in the incoming Congress. She and the House intelligence committee's incoming chairman, Rep. Adam Schiff, D-Calif., have said they want to help protect Mueller and launch investigations of their own into Trump. Meet the new boss Whitaker is a former U.S. district attorney and Division I football player who has been a longtime supporter of Trump and his allies. Before he became Sessions' chief of staff, Whitaker was an accomplished athlete and attorney in Iowa. In college, he started at tight end for an Iowa Hawkeyes football team that played in the 1991 Rose Bowl. Let's Go Hawks!  On Iowa!  #Hawkeyes #CyHawk #HawkeyeState pic.twitter.com/wMpOuhEahn He served as the U.S. attorney for the Southern District of Iowa from 2004-2009, and was well respected in Republican circles in the state, according to the Des Moines Register. He was the co-chairman of former Texas Gov. Rick Perry's 2012 Iowa campaign for president, and campaigned himself for the Senate seat opened by the retirement of Democrat Tom Harkin. Whitaker garnered more than 11,000 votes in the primary, which he lost to Joni Ernst who went on to win election to the Senate. He also worked on an earlier campaign in Iowa for one of Trump's presidential campaign leaders, Sam Clovis, who has figured in the Russia investigation. Clovis is believed to be one of the campaign officials who talked with a junior aide, George Papadopoulos, about the overtures Papadopoulos was getting from Russians in London. The commentator Whitaker's views as an outside commentator before joining the government have been music to the ears of Trump and Republicans. He's been an advocate for sharply restricting the avenues down which Mueller's investigators can travel, as when he responded to reports that Mueller might be looking into Trump's financial relationships with Russians. Experts say, however, that any investigation into the role foreign countries play in domestic politics must delve down financial rabbit holes. \"[Mueller's team is] looking for ties, they're looking for relationships, and a lot of that will come down to money trails,\" Jennifer Rodgers, the former executive director of the Center for the Advancement of Public Integrity at Columbia Law School, told NPR last year. And separately, two years ago, after then-FBI Director James Comey announced he would not recommend charges against Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton for her use of a private email server, Whitaker penned an opinion piece for USA Today headlined \"I would indict Hillary Clinton.\" \"Director Comey's judgment was that \"no reasonable prosecutor\" would bring the case. I disagree,\" Whitaker wrote. \"I believe myself to have been a reasonable prosecutor, and when the facts and evidence show a criminal violation has been committed, the individuals involved should not dictate whether the case is prosecuted.\"",

Updated at 5:34 p.m. ET Jeff Sessions, the president's earliest and most fervent supporter in Congress, resigned under pressure as attorney general on Wednesday after brutal criticism from the president, bringing an abrupt end to his controversial tenure as the nation's top law enforcement officer. Sessions noted in his resignation letter to the president that he was stepping down \"at your request.\" President Trump wrote on Twitter after a marathon press conference at the White House that Sessions was out and that Sessions' chief of staff, Matthew Whitaker, would serve as an acting replacement. We are pleased to announce that Matthew G. Whitaker, Chief of Staff to Attorney General Jeff Sessions at the Department of Justice, will become our new Acting Attorney General of the United States. He will serve our Country well.... Whitaker's responsibilities as acting attorney general will include oversight of the investigation into whether Trump's campaign conspired with the Russian attack on the 2016 election \u2014 the inquiry being run by special counsel Robert Mueller. It wasn't immediately clear what that would mean for Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, who has been supervising Mueller and has been the public face of the investigation in place of a reticent and press-averse special counsel. Democrats immediately began to call for Whitaker to recuse himself from oversight of the Mueller inquiry, citing earlier comments by Whitaker about Mueller and his office. Before he joined the Justice Department, Whitaker wrote for CNN.com that he thought reports about Mueller investigating Trump's finances went too far afield of the special counsel's mandate and that Mueller might be approaching a \"red line.\" Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., said on Wednesday that showed Whitaker shouldn't gain any insight into Mueller's work. \"Given his previous comments advocating defunding and imposing limitations on the Mueller investigation, Mr. Whitaker should recuse himself from its oversight for the duration of his time as acting attorney general,\" Schumer said. Schumer's call for recusal was echoed by House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., who also wrote on Twitter that \"Congress must take immediate action to protect the rule of law and integrity of the investigation.\" Given his record of threats to undermine & weaken the Russia investigation, Matthew Whitaker should recuse himself from any involvement in Mueller\u2019s investigation. Congress must take immediate action to protect the rule of law and integrity of the investigation. #FollowTheFacts Exit the attorney general Sessions, 71, lasted not quite two years in the job. But in that brief period, the former Alabama senator managed to usher in a new era at the Justice Department. Sessions threatened so-called sanctuary cities with the loss of federal funding and announced a \"zero-tolerance policy\" for people who cross the southern U.S. border illegally. He decried a looming wave of violent crime across the country, even though criminologists maintain that homicides and assaults remain near historic lows in most places. He ordered federal prosecutors to seek the most serious charges and stiff prison sentences against drug criminals, a stark reversal of President Barack Obama's most prominent and bipartisan justice policy. Sessions presided over a rollback in investigations of local police. He rescinded policies that directed federal prosecutors to go after only the biggest cases involving marijuana in states where the drug is legal. And he recommitted to using private prisons for U.S. inmates and detainees. GOP praise for Sessions; Dems worry about Russia investigation The resignation elicited predictably mixed reaction from top lawmakers on Capitol Hill. Sen. Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, which has jurisdiction to conduct oversight of the Justice Department, praised Sessions. \"Jeff Sessions is a dedicated public servant and man of honor,\" Grassley said in a statement, adding, \"Jeff deserves the thanks of the nation for his service.\" Grassley also spoke highly of Whitaker, saying, \"The Justice Department is in good hands during this time of transition.\" Sen. John Cornyn, R-Texas, an influential member of Senate Judiciary Committee, likewise praised Sessions: \"As our country's top law enforcement official, he has been integral in fighting the opioid epidemic, keeping violent criminals off our streets, and supporting victims,\" Cornyn said in a statement. \"Those who know him understand his commitment to the rule of law, and his deep and abiding concern for our country.\" \"I hope everyone will join me in honoring his public service to the country,\" Cornyn added. And Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., another top member of the committee, lauded Sessions. \"Jeff Sessions served our nation well and honorably as Attorney General. He has dedicated his whole life to conservatism and upholding the Rule of Law,\" Graham said in a statement. Graham, an increasingly vocal Trump ally in recent months as Sessions' stock declined with the president, said he planned to remain in the Senate amid speculation he could replace Sessions and take the reins of the Justice Department. \"As to me, I will be part of a larger Republican majority in the United States Senate \u2014 working with the President and my Republican and Democratic colleagues \u2014 to make America safer and more prosperous,\" Graham also said Wednesday. While Republicans praised Sessions, Democrats were immediately concerned about the resignation's impact on the Mueller investigation. \"It would create a constitutional crisis if this were a prelude to ending or greatly limiting\" the investigation, Schumer said Wednesday when he learned of Sessions' resignation during a press conference. And top Democrats in the House were equally concerned. \"It is impossible to read Attorney General Sessions' firing as anything other than another blatant attempt by @realDonaldTrump to undermine & end Special Counsel Mueller's investigation,\" Pelosi, the likely next House speaker, wrote on Twitter. And Rep. Jerrold Nadler, D-N.Y., tweeted that \"Americans must have answers immediately\" about the president's reasoning for removing Sessions. Nadler, who is poised to become chairman of the House Judiciary Committee next year and lead that committee's oversight of DOJ, added, \"Why is the President making this change and who has authority over Special Counsel Mueller's investigation? We will be holding people accountable.\" Americans must have answers immediately as to the reasoning behind @realDonaldTrump removing Jeff Sessions from @TheJusticeDept. Why is the President making this change and who has authority over Special Counsel Mueller\u2019s investigation? We will be holding people accountable. https://t.co/weykMuiCxm A long fuse The seeds of Sessions' departure were planted during his confirmation hearing. Sessions went out of his way to deny meeting with Russians in the course of the 2016 presidential campaign. His former colleagues in the Senate approved the nomination 52 to 47, despite concerns about allegations of racial insensitivity and hostility to civil rights in his past. But Sessions soon ran into trouble. He was forced to correct his Senate testimony to indicate that he had, in fact, met with the Russian ambassador at least twice in 2016. Democrats on Capitol Hill accused him of making false statements. The disclosure provoked intense public scrutiny of his actions. By March 2017, Sessions fielded questions almost daily about whether he could oversee the ongoing Department of Justice investigation into Russian interference in the election, given his vocal role in the campaign, in which he even donned a \"Make America Great Again\" hat to support Donald Trump. Ultimately, after consulting with DOJ ethics officials, Sessions recused himself from the Russia probe. He cited long-standing rules regarding conflicts that arise when authorities investigate campaigns in which they participate. The recusal decision was hailed by Democrats and good government groups. The president had a different reaction. Two sources familiar with the situation have told NPR that Trump raged, sometimes profanely, in phone and face-to-face conversations with Sessions. It didn't take long for Trump to voice open regret, on social media and in interviews, about having nominated Sessions. The president grew even more antagonistic when Sessions' deputy, Rod Rosenstein, appointed a special counsel to lead the Russia investigation after Trump fired FBI Director James Comey. Trump called the DOJ Russia probe a \"witch hunt\" and cast aspersions on its leader, former FBI Director Robert Mueller, a registered Republican. Trump's allies produced an ad attacking Mueller's team for donating to Democratic political campaigns. All the while, Sessions ducked questions on the matter, given his recusal. But as Mueller hired more than two dozen staff members and prosecutors, with experience in corporate fraud, money laundering, organized crime and executive privilege, Trump exploded. He denigrated Sessions, Rosenstein, Mueller and the entire post-Watergate practice of law enforcement independence from the White House in an interview with The New York Times in mid-July 2017. \"Sessions should have never recused himself, and if he was going to recuse himself, he should have told me before he took the job and I would have picked somebody else,\" Trump said. Former Justice Department veterans said those remarks reflected a deep misunderstanding of the culture at the Justice Department and the FBI \u2014 which try to insulate their work from politics \u2014 and a sense that Trump was acknowledging he wanted his attorney general to protect him in the Russia investigation and not get to the bottom of the matter. The issue gnawed at Trump, who days later issued a series of early morning tweets on July 22, 2017, wondering why Democrat Hillary Clinton and Comey were not under investigation for unspecified offenses. He repeated the question on July 24, 2017, referring to Sessions as \"our beleaguered A.G.\" So why aren't the Committees and investigators, and of course our beleaguered A.G., looking into Crooked Hillarys crimes & Russia relations? The political establishment in Washington, D.C., began wondering aloud how long Sessions could keep his job. At first, former colleagues in the Senate mobilized and came to his aid, defending his integrity. At the time, Graham told reporters, \"If Jeff Sessions is fired, there will be holy hell to pay.\" Sen. Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, who leads the Senate Judiciary Committee, tweeted \"no way\" would he hold confirmation hearings for a new attorney general in 2017. For his part, Sessions told Tucker Carlson of Fox News that the barbs from Trump had been \"hurtful\" but that he served at the pleasure of the president. Attorney general of everything else Sessions kept working. He flew to El Salvador for a series of anti-gang meetings in late July 2017. There, the attorney general told graduates of a law enforcement academy that he was \"blessed\" to serve as the highest justice official in the United States. \"It is an honor I never expected nor one I ever would have thought possible,\" Sessions said. \"And while there are good days and bad days in any job, one thing has been clear to me, it is a privilege to serve one's country in law enforcement to wake up each morning and fight the fight for the rule of law.\" And Sessions continued to set the broad priorities of the Justice Department, including a crackdown on illegal immigration and support for cases of religious liberty \u2014 although those priorities sometimes came into conflict. His boss, Trump, appeared to have less respect for the legal system. After the special counsel unsealed indictments against his onetime campaign chairman, Paul Manafort, and Manafort business associate Richard Gates on Oct. 30, 2017, Trump insisted there was \"no collusion\" with Russia and reiterated his view that the investigation was a waste of time. In early November 2017, Trump told reporters, \"a lot of people are disappointed in the Justice Department, including me.\" He said he was \"frustrated\" that he could not direct DOJ or the FBI to take action in specific cases, remarks that Justice Department veterans consider a serious breach. At the same time, questions about Sessions' conduct during the campaign resurfaced after a guilty plea by onetime foreign policy aide George Papadopoulos. Papadopoulos told prosecutors that he tried to set up a meeting between Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin during the campaign and that he mentioned it at a March 2016 meeting attended by both Trump and Sessions. From the start of his tenure in the Trump Cabinet, Sessions fielded questions about whether he could oversee the ongoing Department of Justice investigation into Russian interference in the election.\n                \n                    \n                    Brendan Smialowski/AFP/Getty Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption From the start of his tenure in the Trump Cabinet, Sessions fielded questions about whether he could oversee the ongoing Department of Justice investigation into Russian interference in the election. \"These facts appear to contradict your sworn testimony on several occasions,\" Democrats on the House Judiciary Committee pointed out in a letter to the attorney general. Sessions would get another chance on Capitol Hill to explain what he did in 2016 and how it related to Russia. In essence, he argued that he had a memory lapse and that recent news accounts of the Papadopoulos plea refreshed his recollection. \"I have always told the truth, and I have answered every question as I understood them and to the best of my recollection,\" the attorney general told lawmakers at a hearing on Nov. 14, 2017. \"But I will not accept and reject accusations that I have ever lied under oath. That is a lie.\" Sessions' lawyer confirmed that in early 2018, the attorney general voluntarily sat for an extended interview with special counsel investigators, as a witness in the probe into possible obstruction of justice by the president. Trump later said he was \"not concerned\" about that interview. To the dismay of former Justice Department leaders, Sessions mostly remained silent in late 2017 as the president attacked the DOJ as a \"deep state\" and tweeted the FBI's reputation was \"in Tatters.\" And, though he seemed to take action by reportedly directing federal prosecutors and FBI agents to look into Trump's political opponent Hillary Clinton, her email practices and the Clinton Foundation, that wasn't enough for conservative members of his own party. Two members of the House Freedom Caucus wrote in early 2018 that \"it would appear [Sessions] has no control at all of the premier law enforcement agency in the world.\" The two conservative House Republicans also suggested even then that it was time for Sessions to go. Time marches on Still, the Justice Department moved ahead. Following the guilty plea by Trump lawyer and fixer Michael Cohen, and the conviction of Manafort on the same day in August, Trump lashed out at Sessions, telling Fox News that the attorney general had never taken control of the Justice Department. The president added that Sessions only had the plum job because of Sessions' loyalty during the campaign. But in a rare defense of himself and his department, Sessions issued a public statement. \"I took control of the Department of Justice the day I was sworn in, which is why we have had unprecedented success at effectuating the President's agenda\u2014 one that protects the safety and security and rights of the American people, reduces violent crime, enforces our immigration laws, promotes economic growth, and advances religious liberty,\" Sessions said. So long as he was attorney general, Sessions added, the Justice Department \"will not be improperly influenced by political considerations.\" Sessions said he was proud of law enforcement officials and agents, whom he described as the best in the world.",

Imagine if President Trump, on the weekend after the upcoming midterm elections, suddenly forced out Jeff Sessions, Rod Rosenstein and Robert Mueller. For the record, that would be the removal of the attorney general, the deputy attorney general and the special counsel investigating Russian interference in the 2016 election. And imagine Trump also shut down the offices occupied by Mueller's team of prosecutors \u2014 lock, stock and barrel. Just like that. Impossible, you say? Unprecedented? In fact, it is neither. It is the scenario Washington, D.C., witnessed exactly 45 years ago this weekend, when President Nixon lost patience with his own Justice Department's relentless investigation of the Watergate case \u2014 a case that would eventually bring about Nixon's resignation. Nixon's firing spree was soon dubbed the Saturday Night Massacre. And, by that name, it has remained notorious enough to be mentioned whenever a president seems to be contemplating serial firings. In Trump's early months in office, his removal of an acting attorney general (Sally Yates) and the director of the FBI (James Comey) drew comparisons to the infamous Saturday in 1973. Trump has made manifest his unhappiness with Sessions, who recused himself from the Russia investigation, leaving Rosenstein to take it over. The president has recently held more than one personal meeting with Rosenstein, who has increasingly been regarded as a target of Trump's distrust since he appointed Mueller. On the job now for about a year and a half, Mueller has prosecuted a number of Russian officials and several Americans \u2014 winning several convictions and guilty pleas with agreements to cooperate. These include Paul Manafort, who was briefly Trump's campaign chairman in 2016 and will be sentenced in February. Trump has restrained his famous penchant for firing close associates, at least so far. But if the approaching midterms are a factor in his thinking, that restraint might be coming to an end with Election Day on November 6. There were no midterms looming for Nixon in October 1973. He was trying to deal with a bout of economic troubles and a hot war in the Middle East. (Dubbed the Yom Kippur War, the fighting had begun earlier in the month and Israel had come close to being overrun.) But he also was trying to rid himself of the lingering cloud of a scandal from the year before, and he may have thought the busy news docket of that weekend made it the perfect time. To review the state of affairs that fall: It all began when five men were arrested after breaking into the headquarters of the Democratic National Committee, an office inside the Watergate hotel complex. That incident happened in June 1972 during the president's re-election campaign, and the burglars were later found to have ties to that campaign. In fact, their escapade that night had been part of a far larger scheme of espionage and sabotage against Democratic candidates. Much of this was revealed by two young investigative reporters for The Washington Post named Bob Woodward and Carl Bernstein. It all began when five men were arrested after breaking into the headquarters of the Democratic National Committee, an office inside the Watergate hotel complex, seen here in 1973.\n                \n                    \n                    BD/Associated Press\n                    \n                \nhide caption It all began when five men were arrested after breaking into the headquarters of the Democratic National Committee, an office inside the Watergate hotel complex, seen here in 1973. Despite these early revelations, Nixon was re-elected in November of that year, carrying 49 of the 50 states. So it was amazing that in the first months of 1973, his presidency began to sag under the weight of Watergate. It turned out the White House and the president had been involved in obtaining \"hush money\" for the burglars. This led to the sudden departure of Nixon's chief of staff, top domestic adviser and White House counsel. Nixon had also fired his previous attorney general, replacing him with a longtime backer and Republican loyalist named Elliot Richardson. The summer had featured weeks of televised hearings by a special Senate investigating committee. Among other things, the viewing public saw former White House counsel John Dean testify that he had told the president of a cancer growing on the presidency. Audiences also heard a White House aide reveal that all conversations in Nixon's Oval Office were recorded and preserved on tape. The senators wanted to hear the tapes. So did Archibald Cox, a law professor who had been tapped by Richardson to be a Justice Department special prosecutor and sort out the Watergate imbroglio once and for all. Nixon did not want to hand over the tapes. Cox got a subpoena. Negotiations dragged on; some tapes were released and others were withheld. After weeks of standoff, Nixon tired of the confrontation. So on that Saturday afternoon, Oct. 20, 1973, he ordered Richardson to fire Cox. Archibald Cox, a law professor who had been tapped to be a Justice Department special prosecutor and sort out the Watergate imbroglio, is seen in 1973.\n                \n                    \n                    John Duricka/AP\n                    \n                \nhide caption Archibald Cox, a law professor who had been tapped to be a Justice Department special prosecutor and sort out the Watergate imbroglio, is seen in 1973. Richardson was deeply disturbed by the dilemma and refused to fire the man he had chosen. Richardson resigned instead. His deputy, William Ruckelshaus, also an establishment Republican of long standing, also refused to fire Cox and resigned. Nixon summoned his solicitor general, whose job was usually presenting arguments for the administration in cases before the Supreme Court. As the third-ranking official in the Justice Department, that man was now the acting attorney general. Nixon told him to fire Cox, and he did so. (His name was Robert Bork, and 14 years later the Senate would refuse to confirm him for a seat on the Supreme Court after a highly contentious review process in which the memory of his firing of Cox was a factor.) Robert Bork, who ultimately fired Cox, was nominated by President Reagan in 1987 to be a justice on the Supreme Court. The Senate refused to confirm him.\n                \n                    \n                    John Duricka/AP\n                    \n                \nhide caption Robert Bork, who ultimately fired Cox, was nominated by President Reagan in 1987 to be a justice on the Supreme Court. The Senate refused to confirm him. But going back to October 1973, it was still Saturday night, and the nation suddenly saw news anchors' faces interrupting their entertainment programs \u2014 repeating the facts of the firings with a mix of solemnity and disbelief. Correspondents, including a very young Tom Brokaw on NBC, stood outside the White House reading from carefully worded scripts. By that time, FBI agents had appeared at the special prosecutor's office to remove boxes and lock the doors. Members of Cox's investigative team were there, captured by TV camera crews milling in the halls in a state of surprise and confusion. Confusion would reign for some time to come. Members of Nixon's inner circle had convinced themselves the Cox investigation could be ended with minimal public concern. They could not have been more mistaken. The firings dominated the news, despite the important foreign and domestic stories of the day. Congress, controlled in both chambers by Democrats, renewed its efforts to obtain the tapes. Most importantly, Nixon was pressured by his party to appoint a new special prosecutor in Cox's place. He named Leon Jaworski, a a conservative Democrat from Texas who had told friends he never made much of the whole Watergate affair until the night of the Saturday Night Massacre. Jaworski would surprise many by digging in and pursuing the tapes and other elements of the Watergate case with dogged determination. His work eventually forced the confrontation over the tapes all the way to the Supreme Court, which ruled unanimously against Nixon's claim of executive privilege. About the same time, in late July 1974, the House Judiciary Committee approved the first of three articles of impeachment against Nixon for consideration by the whole House. Approval there was assured. Republican senators sent a message to the White House. The necessary two-thirds majority required to remove Nixon from office was already a reality. On August 9, 1974, Nixon became the only U.S. president to resign.",

            "article_content": "A Memoir of Working Hard and Being Broke in the Richest Country on Earth by Sarah Smarsh Hardcover, 290 pages | Your purchase helps support NPR programming. How? Sarah Smarsh grew up in rural Kansas \u2014 the fifth generation to farm the same land, riding tractors where her ancestors rode wagons. There was never enough money and prospects were few. She was part of the what has become popularized as the white working class. But back then, she didn't know it. \"I never in a million years thought that I was poor, and I don't think that my family would have used that word either when we were \u2014 well, and many are \u2014 living that experience,\" Smarsh told NPR's Lulu Garcia-Navarro in an interview for Weekend Edition Sunday. \"Our sense was: We got enough to eat, and there is a roof keeping the elements off of our head, and so I guess, if someone would have asked, we would have thought we were, say, middle class. Her new book, Heartland: A Memoir of Working Hard and Being Broke in the Richest Country on Earth, has just been nominated for the annual National Book Foundation longlist awards in non-fiction category. In it, Smarsh talks about how her family story reflects the wider story of inequality and poverty in America. On the term \"intergenerational poverty\" and its limits Yeah, and even the term poverty \u2014 since I write about class, I think about the power of words and our word choice often, and I never in a million years thought that I was poor, and I don't think that my family would have used that word either when we were \u2014 well, and many are \u2014 living that experience. Our sense was: We got enough to eat, and there is a roof keeping the elements off of our head, and so I guess, if someone would have asked, we would have thought we were, say, middle class. And I think that \"working poor\" is a good term for the experience my family was living, because that kind of gets at the reason that we were poor, which is not for lack of effort and participation in these systems that we're encouraged to believe in. It was rather for markets and low wages that we had no control over ourselves. So much storytelling about poverty is overlaid with this sense of pity and sometimes even condescension that casts it as this overwhelmingly bleak experience. And in fact, my life and my family was often brimming with humor and joy and love \u2014 a lot of hardship too of course. On being a child from a line of teenage mothers For some reason \u2014 I don't know if it was just my disposition as a kid \u2014 the future journalist in me was always looking around, trying to get to the bottom of things, and to understand all these deep truths about our family that no one was talking about. And I knew my mom was unhappy, and I knew that something about it had to do with her role as a mother. This, I think, fostered in me a really precocious sense of my own would-be participation in that same path. And so by the time I was of childbearing age, even as a prepubescent, I was already consciously thinking about how I really wanted to make sure that I didn't have a baby when I was really young and really poor. That absolutely informed the way that I structured this book, which is addressed to that would-have-been child that I did successfully circumvent having. Teenage pregnancy has everything to do with poverty, in some ways, and it's something that we \u2014 that I have not really seen addressed outright as much as I think it ought to be: This relationship between the female body, her womb, motherhood and one's socioeconomic outcomes. On how the working poor are viewed as dispensable, and on poor whiteness in particular Toward the beginning, I directly address a term that gets at that within the context of my own racial experience, whiteness: \"white trash.\" Trash, of course, is garbage; it is dispensable; it is, by definition, something to be thrown away. And it's a dangerous way to talk about human beings, about ourselves, about our country. I think it says a lot about the way that power and these power structures and strata in this so-called socioeconomic ladder that we measure our country by really often informs our language in some really destructive ways. ... I often find that there is a particular derision toward or contempt for poor whiteness that comes from better-off whites. You know, this is a very different experience on the privilege continuum than being a person of color. But it still nonetheless has something to do with race, I think. ... If we have a culture really built on the foundations of white supremacy and ideas that are deeply embedded in our society about whiteness essentially being a shorthand for economic stability and power ... it's kind of implicit in that, for the white people that trade in those ideas, that that's sort of the right order of things. Even, let's say, well-to-do white people who fancy themselves liberal and progressive have such a hateful, venomous attitude toward members of their own race who have not won in this capitalist society, in economic terms. And that seems to me to suggest that they are offended by essentially looking in the mirror, seeing someone who is more a physical reflection of themselves in whiteness, who is living the shame of poverty. On the increased attention paid to the white working class following the 2016 presidential election On the one hand, you know, coming from rural America, I think, oh, all right, now we're getting some attention in national discussion. But the hell of it is, it's often, from my view, the wrong attention, framed the wrong way, asking the wrong questions, and making the wrong assessments. I'd almost rather just be left alone. So we've sort of moved from a sense of invisibility to a stunning, broad stereotype casting millions of Americans as somehow a political and cultural monolith. It seems to me that what's going on right now is the scapegoating of a group that I know in some pockets to be very progressive, and is not at all represented by the media attention that's going on right now. On what her family thinks of the book Yeah, the way they look at it, I think, is: This is a very strange and rare experience for one to have, to be made a character in a nonfiction book. But they understand work. They respect work. They're not necessarily book people, but they know I'm doing my job, and they respect that. And though \u2014 I think the way they see stories is: If it's true, it's true. So there's neither pride nor shame on their part. I think they just feel like \u2014 they believe I got it right, and that's the best review I could get. Hiba Ahmad and Barrie Hardymon produced and edited this interview for broadcast.

Saturday Night Live head writers and Weekend Update hosts Colin Jost and Michael Che have different attitudes toward co-hosting the Emmy awards Monday night. Jost admits to being nervous about hosting \u2014 especially when he thinks about the show ahead of time: \"I'm thinking about it in advance. That's more nerve racking than when you're actually out on stage.\" Che, meanwhile, takes a more laid back approach to the show. \"You can't be nervous. It's comedy,\" he says. \"If I was a fireman I'd be scared. Firemen should be afraid. ... But for comedy, we're literally going out there and we're just going to tell some jokes and people are going to like them or not. There's nothing to be afraid of.\" As co-head writers for SNL Jost and Che are used to the high pressure. \"Head writer\" sounds like a great and lofty title, Che says, but it's really more of a supervisory role \u2014 someone whose job it is to think about the show overall. \"We're competing to get stuff on just like any other writer,\" he explains. \"You don't walk around with a big ol' cigar or anything like that.\" As for what being a head writer means to Jost? He answers: \"Great question, we would love someone to explain it to us.\" SNL is up for 21 Emmys \u2014 including a the award for outstanding writing for a variety series. On writing the show up to the very last minute Colin Jost: The first part [of the show] is usually the part that's figured out last, which is what makes the job stressful. Michael Che: Because the news cycle is so quick now that what seems relevant Monday probably won't by Saturday. Jost: [SNL executive producer] Lorne [Michaels] always talks about how the first 15 minutes of the show are the most important, because if you're tuning in, that's your real chance to hook a viewer. The monologue is such a tricky thing always, because you want to show off who this person is, maybe in a way you haven't seen them before ... and the cold open is such a different animal, and that's constantly shifting. The number of weeks where the cold open and the monologue are both even vaguely figured out before Thursday, it almost never happens. If it does, you just cross your fingers that those will hold up by Saturday. On what it was like to have Donald Trump host SNL when he was campaigning for president, and whether he would be interested in having Trump back on the show Che: [It was] working with an unfunny, insecure dude. ... For me, I don't mind anybody being on the show, because I think something good can come out of anything in comedy. But I wouldn't go for it [again]. ... I don't know what the \"win\" is. I don't think people find him funny. On behind-the-scenes at SNL after the 2016 presidential election with host Dave Chappelle Jost: The next day when we were there for the table read, [Chappelle] was like, \"The reason you're in comedy is to react to things that are going on and make them funny, to find humor even in whatever's the weird, darkest things. You have to figure out how to still put on a comedy show, because that's why you're doing this.\" I think that was just the right motivation for everyone to try to put a show together by Saturday that was still a comedy show, and I think that was reflected in his monologue really well. Che, on his decision to comment on comedian Louis C.K. returning to the stage after admitting to sexual misconduct Che: I truly think him going onstage and not addressing anything was insane. I don't fault the attempt of making it right; I do fault the execution of not making it right. I think everybody has the right to defend themselves. Everybody has the right to take the opportunity to clarify or apologize or make any bad situation right, but when you don't do it, you can't \u2014 it's indefensible. On disliking Twitter \u2014 Che deleted his account several years ago Che: I don't like Twitter, because no one is as angry as they say they are and no one is as happy as they say they are. It's just kind of this land of hyperbole. I have a platform. We go on TV and we're lucky enough to be able to tweet to a camera. It's not for me. I just don't like the way it makes people feel. I don't like the way it makes people gang up on other people \u2014 justly or not, it's just uncomfortable. I don't like it at all. It's just a cesspool of everybody just yelling at each other. Anger and extreme joy are the only voices that get heard on Twitter. Jost: It also used to have a great function, because you'd follow comedians or your friends who were really funny and every time you'd go on you'd see a great joke. ... Having Twitter on your phone is like being with a journalist that hates you 24 hours a day. Anything you say on that can be spun. Truly, that's what you have to think of it as. Che: It's like walking around with the district attorney and everything you say is just going to the district attorney. Heidi Saman and Thea Chaloner produced and edited this interview for broadcast.

That's according to an early account of the new book by Bob Woodward, which takes readers inside the White House for aides' dealings with the president. The president, to be clear, denies all of this. He calls himself the greatest president in decades and points to the thriving economy and his projects underway around the globe, including his negotiations with North Korea over its nuclear weapons program. Closer to home, however, Justice Department special counsel Robert Mueller wants Trump to answer questions about the Russian attack on the 2016 election \u2014 which was directed toward helping him be elected \u2014 and the actions he has taken since. The president's lawyers and the special counsel's office have been negotiating for months over how or whether that happens, and those talks apparently continue. What is clear now, per Woodward according to a report by The Washington Post, is how strongly Dowd has argued to Trump that he must never testify or agree to an interview. Even if \u2014 as Trump and Dowd argue \u2014 there has been no underlying wrongdoing either with the Russians or since, Trump can't tell the truth long enough to talk with the special counsel's investigators about anything, Dowd reportedly concluded. Under this thesis, Trump will tell a falsehood about anything under any circumstances, and the feds will have trapped him into a perjury charge unrelated to Russia or potential obstruction of justice. For Dowd, that means Trump must tell Mueller \"no\" to an interview, no matter what. When Trump didn't agree, Dowd quit, Woodward reports, according to The Washington Post. Even if special counsel Robert Mueller goes quiet for the next two months to avoid affecting the midterm elections, it appears he will continue to work out of the public eye.\n                \n                    \n                    Alex Wong/Getty Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption Even if special counsel Robert Mueller goes quiet for the next two months to avoid affecting the midterm elections, it appears he will continue to work out of the public eye. The optics Trump appears to consider a solid \"no\" politically untenable. He continues to hold open the possibility of talking with Mueller, as the president told reporters again on Friday. Trump's current personal attorney, Rudy Giuliani, continues negotiating with the special counsel but, in at least one interview, all but dared Mueller to issue a subpoena \u2014 which Giuliani and Trump would fight. We've talked about that scenario in the past. Trump might win ... or Trump might lose. (Giuliani told NPR he thinks his odds are better than 50/50.) Based on the reports of this week, however, even if Mueller succeeded in getting a judge \u2014 or the Supreme Court \u2014 to compel Trump to testify, the president's lawyers still might counsel him to not talk, under his Fifth Amendment privilege. By the time of that decision, Trump might have spent months or potentially years attacking federal law enforcement and delegitimizing it in the eyes of his supporters \u2014 lessening the political implications of not cooperating. Meaning what? This would resolve what Trump calls the \"perjury trap\" problem, but it doesn't help Mueller or the public get any closer to the facts of the 2016 attack on the election. In fact, the early account of the Woodward book raises the question about whether there ever could be a satisfactory conclusion to the inquiry. If Trump, according to someone who was once a close legal adviser, cannot tell the truth and may not know what the truth is, could he ever be involved in a definitive accounting of what took place? The president says he did not know, for example, that Donald Trump Jr. and other campaign leaders met the Russian delegation in Trump Tower in June 2016 to get the dirt the Russian government had offered on Hillary Clinton. There are suggestions that Trump may have been involved: Trump Jr.'s phone calls, for example, suggest he may have spoken to his father at the time he was setting up the meeting. Mueller's investigators might be able to establish whom Trump Jr. called. But the question Woodward's book raises is whether anyone ever truly can establish \u2014 from Trump anyway \u2014 what Trump knew or what actions he took. When the Apollo astronauts flew around the dark side of the moon, it blocked their contact with Earth. They went through \"loss of signal,\" or LOS, and their communications and telemetry were silent until they re-emerged from behind the other side. Have Mueller and the special counsel's office flown behind the moon? Friday marked 60 days until Election Day. According to one strain of conventional wisdom in Washington, D.C., the special counsel's office now must stay dark to avoid interfering with the midterm campaigns. If that is what has happened, there are signs work will continue even if it doesn't become public. At least one witness testified on Friday to the D.C. grand jury that Mueller has been working with. A key figure in the Russia investigation was sentenced on Friday \u2014 of which more below. But the short week after Labor Day passed without another seismic shock: no high-profile indictments, no historic doorstop report, no U.S. Marshals Service deputies or FBI special agents driving up to the West Wing with a battering ram. Does that mean Mueller will preserve LOS all the way until November? The only way to know for sure may be whether he makes a move. A protester holds up a sign as former Trump campaign aide George Papadopoulos arrives at the U.S. District Court for his sentencing hearing Friday in Washington, D.C.\n                \n                    \n                    Alex Wong/Getty Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption A protester holds up a sign as former Trump campaign aide George Papadopoulos arrives at the U.S. District Court for his sentencing hearing Friday in Washington, D.C. A federal judge on Friday sentenced George Papadopoulos, a former Trump campaign foreign policy adviser, to 14 days in prison, one year of supervised release and a fine of $9,500 after he pleaded guilty to lying to the FBI. Papadopoulos' was the first case brought by the special counsel's office, and he was the origin of the Russia investigation. In the spring of 2016, working in London, he began to hear from Russian operatives with offers of \"dirt\" on Hillary Clinton or \"off-the-record\" meetings \u2014 including for Trump with Putin. Papadopoulos transmitted those offers to his bosses including, his attorneys say, then-Sen. Jeff Sessions and then-candidate Trump \u2014 although no meeting took place. But what else might have taken place between the campaign and the Russians? That is the big question that continues to lie at the heart of the Russia matter and one which the Papadopoulos sentencing did not answer. It has become clear how aggressively the Russians tried throughout the spring of 2016 to drill exploratory wells into the Trump campaign, directly and via intermediaries. Eventually, at least one succeeded, resulting in the Trump Tower meeting in June. Was that the only one? Did any other contacts take place that aren't publicly known as of now? Will Mueller and the feds ever lay out a complete narrative of what they've established about this critical early phase? Even though the Papadopoulos matter is now closed in the eyes of the law, the public still does not have a complete and official picture of what happened.",

Having watched Capitol Hill for more than 30 years, I have now seen Senate confirmation hearings for an even dozen nominees to the Supreme Court. Some have had moments of high drama. All have had an air of meaning and consequence. Until this week. The current judiciary committee hearings on Brett Kavanaugh, the latest choice from President Trump, have featured more disruption and distraction and less substantial value than any such proceedings in memory. The daily events include the systematic and almost ritual removal of shouting protesters who continue to infiltrate the hearing room in an effort to disrupt the process. While opposed to the nominee, the protesters were anything but helpful to committee Democrats straining to provide some scrutiny. In fact, as Democratic committee member Sheldon Whitehouse of Rhode Island told NPR, the protesters were not only distracting but counterproductive. \"I think that the average independent voter, the labor family that voted for Trump last time but is now reconsidering, people like that don't think screaming in a hearing room is a particularly effective strategy or a signal of a party they want to belong to,\" Whitehouse said. The next striking element from the outset was the attitude of committee Republicans toward the wholesale withholding of documents the committee as a whole had sought to examine. It was remarkable enough that more than 40,000 pages of requested documents were not delivered until the day before the hearing began. But beyond that, the Trump administration had declared off-limits the records of Kavanaugh's time as White House staff secretary in three years of President George W. Bush's first term. The committee's chairman, Iowa Republican Charles Grassley, said the White House material \"did not pertain to Kavanaugh as a judge.\" He dismissed the nominee's own statement that his White House stint had been \"formative\" for him. That stint was at a time when the White House responded to the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11, 2001, and made decisions about the treatment (and even torture) of suspected terrorists. The years in question also included presidential decisions regarding such topics as stem cell research, same-sex marriage and abortion. But of course, the lack of the documents in question makes it impossible to know what Kavanaugh may have thought, written or said about these topics, or whether they were even part of his purview at the time. Without the relevant paper trail, Democrats had no chance of finding vulnerabilities in Kavanaugh's candidacy. Like Neil Gorsuch, who was last year's successful Supreme Court nominee, Kavanaugh was more than ready for his close-up. As a member of the conservative Federalist Society, Kavanaugh had decades of grooming for this moment. He had been preparing, in many ways, all his adult life. Did you want to know his views on abortion, or issuing a subpoena to a sitting president, or a president's power to pardon himself? Of course you did. And of course you are not going to get them. Kavanaugh slipped into the armor of precedent, the refusal of previous nominees to discuss issues that might well come before the high court. Kavanaugh called this the \"Ginsburg rule,\" although in fact Ruth Bader Ginsburg in 1993 was willing to say she thought a \"woman should decide\" \u2014 implying support for abortion rights. And if that made Kavanaugh seem evasive \u2014 if unfailingly charming \u2014 he had only to remind his interrogators that all eight of the current members of the Supreme Court had adopted more or less the same posture in their confirmation hearings. So Kavanaugh was respectful but utterly unresponsive when California Democrat Dianne Feinstein tried to bore in on the questions of presidential privilege and executive pardoning power. Ditto when Democrat Dick Durbin of Illinois tried to pin him down on the role of \"dark money\" contributions in promoting his nomination \u2014 or the role of the Federalist Society in elevating his career. \"President Trump chose me,\" Kavanaugh said, relying on a bottom line that was hard to dispute. Durbin tried to shame Kavanaugh over the withholding of his papers from the White House. \"Do you want to have a cloud over you?\" Durbin asked. But Kavanaugh skated away by noting how little control he had over the disposition of those records. Durbin noted that the man tasked with much of the relevant document review this summer had been William Burck, a Republican attorney who once worked for Kavanaugh. (Burck's clients now include Don McGahn, the White House counsel, who sat just behind Kavanaugh throughout the first two days of hearings.) And so it went, through one Democrat's list of questions after another. For the Democrats, this is not an exercise in shaping the Supreme Court. It is a series of appeals to their supporters to sympathize with the futility of their predicament. When it was the Republicans' turn, they used their time to give the nominee lots of space in which to shine. \"What makes for a good judge?\" asked Ted Cruz, the Texas senator and 2016 presidential candidate who is better known for tougher lines of inquiry. Mike Lee of Utah, who ousted a less conservative Republican in a primary in 2010, referred to The Federalist Papers (essays written by Alexander Hamilton and others urging ratification of the Constitution) and asked which was Kavanaugh's favorite. No, seriously, he asked that. And Kavanaugh had half a dozen possible picks he was ready to discuss, likening the challenge to naming a favorite among his children. This is not to slight the insight of the Founding Fathers, mind you. Some of us might well delight in disquisitions on the separation of powers or the danger of factions. There is real educational value in all this, and it's great to have it discussed for a national audience. But we know it's not everyone's idea of great television. Suffice it to say, neither the Democrats' line of questioning nor the Republicans' was likely to make a lot of headlines or get much screen time around the country. That is discouraging news for the former and quite gratifying news for the latter. Nothing that President Trump has done to date has been more popular among Republicans than his choices for the Supreme Court. The tax cuts may come close, at least for some, but they have not been the political ten-strike the GOP had hoped. Gorsuch and Kavanaugh, by contrast, are a one-two punch of near perfection for the Trump-voting coalition. The two former clerks for now-retired Justice Anthony Kennedy are more consistently conservative than their mentor, more agile in debate and a generation younger. They could be a force on the court for the next 30 years. But there is one other factor affecting the way these two nominations have been processed. Until last year, nominees for the Supreme Court were at least nominally vulnerable to a filibuster. So even when a president's party had a majority in the Senate, he knew he needed at least a few votes from the other party \u2014 and perhaps a substantial number \u2014 to defeat a potential filibuster. That meant nailing down 60 votes, an imperative that served to moderate the selections of justices by presidents in both parties. But in 2017, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky decided the supermajority should no longer be mandatory. His party backed him to the hilt in this rule change. The Democrats, when last in the majority themselves, had lowered the bar for confirming all other presidential appointments to a simple majority \u2014 51 of the 100 votes in the Senate. McConnell simply pushed this to the max by including the Supreme Court. That shift has drained much of the life from the confirmation process in general, including the hearings before the judiciary committee. At this point, there is no indication that any Republicans are in play on the Kavanaugh vote. It is more likely that several Democrats who are running for re-election this fall in states that voted for Trump will join in supporting the nomination \u2014 as they did for Gorsuch. So the tension that crackled around confirmation hearings for past nominees, including President Barack Obama's Sonia Sotomayor in 2009 and Bush's Samuel Alito in 2005, has largely dissipated. We are not likely to see another nominee get battered beyond confirmation the way President Reagan's Robert Bork was in 1987. So, even with the unsettling cries of protesters being hustled out by Capitol Police, the current hearings seem tame by comparison. Interest groups on both sides continue to buy the airtime and pour on the press releases to rail against Kavanaugh or praise him. But the urgency in all their pleading seems lost when you watch this creaky Senate mechanism working its will in its deliberate way. Kavanaugh's ascent to the nation's highest court will matter a great deal. These hearings, sadly, do not.",

Updated at 11:57 a.m. ET Less than 24 hours after Michael Cohen pleaded guilty to eight federal counts \u2014 ranging from tax evasion to campaign finance violations \u2014 Donald Trump's longtime attorney and fixer brushed aside the possibility of a pardon. In fact, Cohen's own lawyer, Lanny Davis, said his client would outright reject one if it were granted. \"I know that Mr. Cohen would never accept a pardon from a man that he considers to be both corrupt and a dangerous person in the oval office,\" Davis told NPR's Morning Edition. \"And [Cohen] has flatly authorized me to say under no circumstances would he accept a pardon from Mr. Trump.\" Davis said that President Trump has used his pardon power to bail out \"political cronies,\" and that Cohen \"is not interested in being dirtied by a pardon from such a man.\" Conjecture about a presidential pardon picked up steam in the hours after Cohen's guilty plea Tuesday, in which he implicated Trump in unlawful campaign contributions. Cohen could face up to about five years in prison under federal sentencing guidelines, according to his plea agreement, though a judge will make a final determination. In court on Tuesday, Cohen did not name the president but mentioned \"a candidate for federal office,\" a clear reference to Trump. Davis later underscored that Cohen was talking about the president. Cohen told the court he had coordinated payments \u2014 at the candidate's direction \u2014 to stifle stories from two women. The women were not identified by name, but the facts laid out in court papers make clear they are former Playboy model Karen McDougal and adult film actress Stephanie Clifford, aka Stormy Daniels. Both women said they had affairs with Trump and were paid to keep silent. The White House denies the allegations. The statement from Cohen, made under oath in court, provided a stunning exclamation point to the disintegration of his relationship with Trump. Cohen had long professed his loyalty to the president, even once famously declaring that he would take a bullet for him. Now @MichaelCohen212 is committed to continue to do so going forward as can be seen from his sworn statement in federal court today about @realDonaldTrump instruction to @MichaelCohen212 to pay money to 2 women that Mr. Cohen admitted was a campaign finance law violation (2 of 3) Trump has acknowledged that he paid Cohen between $100,000 and $250,000 last year. Trump and his personal lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, have said the president reimbursed Cohen for the payments, which Trump described as being \"used to stop the false and extortionist accusations\" made by Daniels. Trump also has asserted that the funds did not come from campaign coffers. For weeks now, Trump and Giuliani have sought to distance the president from Cohen \u2014 despite a well-documented, years-long relationship. They also have repeatedly questioned Cohen's credibility. That two-pronged approach continued after Cohen's guilty plea. \"There is no allegation of any wrongdoing against the President in the government's charges against Mr. Cohen,\" Giuliani said in a statement. \"It is clear that, as the prosecutor noted, Mr. Cohen's actions reflect a pattern of lies and dishonesty over a significant period of time.\" If anyone is looking for a good lawyer, I would strongly suggest that you don\u2019t retain the services of Michael Cohen! The consistent targeting of Cohen's credibility might be driven by concern over what he knows. Cohen worked for years as Trump's personal lawyer and fixer, two roles that give him extensive knowledge of the president's business and personal dealings. And while Cohen's plea agreement does not include a provision about cooperating with prosecutors, it also doesn't preclude that possibility in the future. This means Cohen could share what he knows with investigators, including special counsel Robert Mueller. Asked whether Cohen is cooperating with the authorities, Davis told NPR that his client has information that Mueller might want, but he wouldn't go into specifics. \"If he [Cohen] tells the truth to the special counsel who talks to him, and I believe he will, he will have topics that in my opinion will be of interest to the special counsel in his Russian investigation and related topics,\" Davis said. Trump, who has taken an increasingly caustic tone with Cohen, struck a sarcastic note on Twitter on Wednesday morning, saying: \"If anyone is looking for a good lawyer, I would strongly suggest that you don't retain the services of Michael Cohen!\" Trump went on to compare Cohen unfavorably with his former campaign chairman, Paul Manafort, who was convicted on eight federal counts in a tax and bank fraud case the same afternoon Cohen pleaded guilty. Trump noted that the jury declared a mistrial on the remaining 10 counts against Manafort, whom Trump lauded Wednesday for having \"refused to 'break' \u2014 make up stories in order to get a 'deal.' \" \"Such respect for a brave man!\" Trump said of Manafort, who faces a separate federal case next month in Washington, D.C. Despite his disparate reactions to the Cohen and Manafort cases, Trump could exercise his presidential prerogative to pardon both men \u2014 a prerogative that Trump has shown little hesitation exercising since taking office. One of those pardons Davis brought up specifically in Wednesday's interview: the one issued to former Arizona Sheriff Joe Arpaio, a staunch Trump supporter. Arpaio had been convicted of criminal contempt after defying a judge's order to stop detaining immigrants because they lacked legal status. Though Arpaio was \"clearly guilty,\" Davis asserted, Trump pardoned him last year.",

But the White House is calibrating its strategy as though a clock is ticking. This week in the Russia investigations: The White House is trying to burn the clock to get into a better political position to handle the Russia imbroglio. Why it might \u2014 or might not \u2014 work. In the championship chess match that is the Russia imbroglio, President Trump and the White House are hoping that Justice Department special counsel Robert Mueller has stumbled into what players call \"time trouble.\" Mueller, they believe, doesn't want to make any major moves or announcements after Labor Day, because he's sensitive to criticism that he might improperly influence the midterm election \u2014 in the way critics on all sides faulted former FBI Director James Comey for his handling of the big investigations in 2016. If that's so, Mueller has roughly three weeks to do whatever he's going to do and then \u2014 who knows? Simply go quiet until after Election Day? Or wrap up his inquiry altogether? As usual, no one knows except him, and there is no independent statement from Mueller to suggest that he feels bound by any of these expectations. Trump and his attorneys, however, led by former New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani, have taken this as their working hypothesis and are crafting their strategy accordingly. This, for example, was the basis upon which \u2014 staying with the chess metaphor \u2014 Giuliani responded to Mueller's latest move last week in their months-long middlegame over a prospective Trump interview in the Russia matter. Mueller wants to talk. Yes, Trump wants to talk too, Giuliani told NPR's Ryan Lucas. But only if the special counsel agrees to constrain himself to certain questions and agree not to broach other ones. Mueller's next move isn't clear. Trump is willing to entertain questions about whether he or anyone in Trump's campaign conspired with the Russian attack, Giuliani said \u2014 the answer, presumably, will be \"no\" in the same way it has been all along in public. That, incidentally, also suggests how confident Trump and his camp are that there is nothing to the collusion/conspiracy track of the Russia imbroglio, at least involving the president. Alleged obstruction The alleged obstruction of justice track is another story. Trump will not address questions about his firing of Comey or his handling of the case of former national security adviser Michael Flynn, Giuliani said. Trump's public explanations in those areas have varied, and Trump's lawyers don't know what other witnesses have told Mueller, so there's a danger of what Giuliani called a \"perjury trap.\" Trump and his supporters say he hasn't done anything wrong, but there's also no way to know what the famously discursive president might say in a high-stakes legal interview. Trump's legal team, for the record, also argues that it is effectively impossible for Trump to commit the crime of obstruction of justice, given his powers under the Constitution. And even if he had, Trump argues, he can pardon himself, so any notional enforcement action is moot. That is not a consensus position in Washington, but these are uncharted waters. Will Mueller agree with Trump's latest offer? So far no one knows. Mueller does not talk publicly. But Giuliani, who can talk as much as he wants, also can give what he calls Mueller's position, and shade public perceptions of how Mueller is doing or what he intends. Hence the origin of the Labor Day cutoff narrative \u2014 is that a real thing? Whether it is or not, the idea is out there now, and Giuliani has created a clock to tick for Mueller's office to consider what Trump considers a generous offer. Mueller, in this construction, can either take the good deal that Trump has outlined \u2014 which Trump wants \u2014 or spurn these good-faith negotiations \u2014 which strengthens Trump's case that Mueller is running a \"witch hunt\" \u2014 or wait for so long that he runs out of time if Labor Day passes \u2014 which Trump wants. Supreme Court nominee Judge Brett Kavanaugh may be among the high court justices who could eventually rule on a dispute between President Trump and the Justice Department.\n                \n                    \n                    Getty Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption Supreme Court nominee Judge Brett Kavanaugh may be among the high court justices who could eventually rule on a dispute between President Trump and the Justice Department. The Labor Day cutoff narrative is important for another reason. The Senate is expected to confirm Brett Kavanaugh to become the ninth Supreme Court justice this autumn; Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., says he wants the judge to be on the bench in time for the high court's October term. If all that plays out as Republicans hope, Kavanaugh will be an invaluable ally for Trump if the situation with Mueller turns sour. Picture this: Negotiations between Trump and Mueller break down. Mueller asks a grand jury to subpoena Trump. It does. Trump asks a federal judge to throw out that subpoena. Washington is plunged into a historic test of the power of the chief executive. The case quickly escalates to the nation's highest court. Waiting there for it is presumptive Justice Kavanaugh, helping form a 5-4 conservative majority sympathetic to strong presidential power and Trump. This doesn't mean the Supreme Court would agree that Trump could neutralize a subpoena and ignore Mueller's demand that the president give evidence. But Trump's lawyers say they like their chances. In fact, Giuliani, in discussing this scenario with NPR, said he thought he and the president had better than a \"50 percent chance\" to win. The bottom line: The White House either wants Mueller to interview Trump under its terms relatively soon or forbear completely until November at the earliest. Not only does it consider this its best political strategy but the delay also may bring about better conditions on the metaphorical battlefield if this tension escalates. None of this is certain. Mueller might decline to follow this path for any number of reasons \u2014 he might not observe the Labor Day cutoff philosophy. The Justice Department's practices surrounding elections aren't hard-and-fast rules and Trump's name isn't on the ballot this year. And even if Mueller were to go ultra-quiet, as submariners say, from Sept. 5 to Nov 6, nothing would stop him from surfacing on Nov. 7 in the fountain on the North Lawn, popping out of the hatch and presenting Trump with a subpoena then. Or he might decide that he doesn't need direct evidence from Trump because he's gotten what he wants from elsewhere. Or he might assess that it isn't worth the risks involved with sparking the Constitutional war that could issue from a subpoena fight. Even though Mueller doesn't talk publicly, he retains political leverage over Trump. The president wants to be seen as cooperating \u2014 magnanimous even in the face of what he calls an \"illegally brought ... rigged Witch Hunt run by people who are totally corrupt and/or conflicted.\" Trump does not want to crash out with Mueller if he can avoid a situation that makes it look like he is shirking questions \u2014 and he does not want to invoke his Fifth Amendment right not to give evidence that might incriminate himself. Trump retains that privilege as would any American under the Constitution, but he and his advisers know the political costs they might have to pay, especially before Election Day. The difficulty in assessing it all \u2014 and how Mueller might be willing to use this leverage \u2014 is not knowing Mueller's side of the story.",

Martha Roby has won a primary runoff against a former Democrat who challenged her over a pledge she made in 2016 not to vote for then-candidate Trump. Roby, a four-term incumbent representing Alabama's 2nd congressional district in the state's southeast, defeated Bobby Bright, a former \"Blue Dog\" conservative Democrat who served in Congress until 2011. Bright later switched parties for the run against Roby, whom he tried to paint as insufficiently supportive of the president. Bobby Bright concedes to Alabama Rep.

Martha Roby at his watch party on Tuesday at KimberLia's restaurant in Prattville, Ala. Roby garnered 67 percent of the vote to Bright's 33 percent, according to The Associated Press. In 2016, following the infamous Access Hollywood tape that went public weeks before the election with Trump heard saying lewd things about women, Roby said he should step aside and that she would not vote for him. This year, she attracted a number of primary challengers. In Alabama's June 5 primary, Roby was unable to clear 50 percent of the vote, which forced her into a runoff with Bright, the second-largest vote-getter. Despite her earlier criticism of Trump, the president tweeted an endorsement of her last month. The New York Times reports that the president \"agreed to endorse Ms. Roby after appeals from Paul D. Ryan, the House speaker, and Kevin McCarthy, the House majority leader and Mr. Ryan's possible successor. And even as he set aside older grievances against Ms. Roby, Mr. Trump underscored, by helping rescue her from political oblivion, that he is the dominant personality in the national Republican Party.\" \"It's been a true privilege to have the support of the White House through this campaign,\" Roby told cheering supporters Tuesday night, according to AP. \"Sincere thanks to President Trump and Vice President Pence,\" she said. \"I am so humbled that the people of Alabama's 2nd Congressional District have again placed their trust and their confidence in me.\" Politico notes, \"While Roby had to repair the damage from her election-year break with Trump, Bright had a major hurdle of his own with GOP primary voters: his Democratic past, particularly his 2009 vote supporting Rep. Nancy Pelosi for speaker of the House.\" Roby is heavily favored to beat Democratic nominee Tabitha Isner, a minister and business analyst, in November.",

Updated at 11:06 a.m. ET The Justice Department's internal watchdog agency unveiled a doorstop-sized report Thursday that provides an inflection point \u2014 but no closure \u2014 in the never-ending war over the 2016 presidential campaign and its aftermath. The nearly 600-page opus by Inspector General Michael Horowitz offers political ammunition for both Republicans and Democrats and resolves a few key questions about what happened behind the scenes during some critical moments of the last presidential election year. Read the report's executive summary here. But it also confirmed that this saga has no end in sight. Here's what you need to know about what it said \u2014 and what will happen next. The Justice Department and the feds did not go easy on Hillary Clinton Horowitz's report excoriates then-FBI Director James Comey, then-Attorney General Loretta Lynch and others for violations of policy, insensitivity toward appearances and other conduct in 2016, but it said none of them acted out of political partisanship. That's important because charges of \"bias\" have formed the basis of months of political attacks by President Trump and his Republicans allies against federal law enforcement. Lynch and Comey let Democratic presidential nominee Clinton off the hook in the matter of her handling secret information on her personal email server while secretary of state, some in the GOP argue. What's more, they say, people inside the Justice Department and the FBI continue working to \"frame\" Trump. No, the IG said: \"We found no evidence that the conclusions by department prosecutors were affected by bias or other improper considerations; rather, we determined that they were based on the prosecutors' assessment of the facts, the law, and past department practice.\" That will not end the charges of \"bias\" and abuse of power by the president and his allies, especially because the IG report did uncover new evidence that individual people on the inside at the bureau, at least, were decidedly anti-Trump. FBI officials talked about wanting to \"stop\" Trump from being elected ... Exhibit A in the case about \"bias\" against Trump is the cache of text messages between an FBI lawyer who has since left the FBI and a senior special agent who is, so far, still employed by the bureau. The frank political opinions in those messages have embarrassed the bureau, and there were still more in the report on Thursday. In the newly released exchange, attorney Lisa Page asks agent Peter Strzok: \"(Trump's) not ever going to become president, right? Right?!\" Strzok responds: \"No. No he's not. We'll stop it.\" The IG and congressional investigations have debunked conspiracy theories about a cabal of insiders using their power to unfairly attack Trump, but this Page-Strzok exchange shows that there really were people inside the bureau who personally opposed his election. Page and Strzok also worked at one time on the unit conducting the investigation into Russia's attack on the 2016 election and whether anyone on the Trump campaign was involved. Strzok was removed from that investigative team in the summer 2017 once the text messages came to the attention of the special counsel's office, according to media reports. And Page had already completed her stint on that team and returned to the FBI by that time. White House press secretary Sarah Sanders told reporters Thursday that messages like those revealed in the report vindicated the worries Trump and his allies have expressed about the ability for federal law enforcement to be impartial now or going forward. That comports precisely with Trump's political strategy of attacking Justice Department special counsel Robert Mueller and his team, including the accusation that they are perpetuating a political \"witch hunt\" against him. ... but Strzok also wondered about the substance of the Russia investigation An attorney for Strzok defended him on Thursday and cited evidence in the report about how strongly he pushed for aggressive investigative techniques in the Clinton email investigation. There's also at least one key message that suggests Strzok and Page didn't join the Russia investigation with clear evidence in hand of wrongdoing by Trump or his campaign but, instead, with open skepticism about whether they might discover any wrongdoing. The two officials texted back and forth about offers to join Mueller's team at the time of his appointment. Although Strzok ultimately joined Mueller's unit, here's how he responded to a message from Page that mentioned the prospect that Trump might be impeached: \"you and I both know the odds are nothing,\" he wrote. \"If I thought it was likely I'd be there no question. I hesitate in part because of my gut sense and concern there's no big there there.\" Strzok later told investigators, as the IG report goes on to describe, that \"my question [was] about whether or not this represented a large, coordinated conspiracy or not.\" Comey, Comey, Comey, Comey, Comey, Comey Former FBI Director James Comey leaves a closed session with the Senate intelligence committee on Capitol Hill June 8, 2017, in Washington, D.C.\n                \n                    \n                    Drew Angerer/Getty Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption Former FBI Director James Comey leaves a closed session with the Senate intelligence committee on Capitol Hill June 8, 2017, in Washington, D.C. The IG report takes its strongest aim at Comey, whom it depicts as an ego-mad schemer choosing on his own when to follow Justice Department practices and when to go his own way or even be \"insubordinate\" to his superiors. In one passage, the report rejects the decision-making process Comey described to Congress that led him to declare publicly not long before Election Day in 2016 that the FBI had reopened its Clinton email investigation. \"Comey's description of his choice as being between 'two doors,' one labeled 'speak' and one labeled 'conceal,' was a false dichotomy,\" the report said. \"The two doors were actually labeled 'follow policy/practice' and 'depart from policy/practice.' \" Comey chose to depart. Before that, he declined to tell Lynch or then-Deputy Attorney General Sally Yates about his intentions, and before that, Comey broached the prospect of calling for a special counsel in the Clinton investigation because he didn't think Lynch could credibly handle the case. But Comey never issued such a call, as the IG report describes, and only invoked the idea as a \"bargaining chip.\" Comey has been defending himself in the year since his firing \u2014 on Twitter, in his book and most recently in a column in The New York Times published online Thursday immediately after the report was officially released. The dilemmas presented in 2016 were unprecedented \u2014 a \"500-year flood\" \u2014 and came with no instruction manual, he argues. For critics, however, including Democrats and especially Trump, the IG report is a book-length indictment of Comey and his leadership. That's important for Trump and his supporters. The president denies accusations that his firing of Comey might have been an attempt to obstruct justice as the FBI pursued its Russia investigation, now led by Mueller. Not only does Trump enjoy the privilege under the Constitution to fire Comey for any reason, the president's legal team argues, now the IG report lays out the most comprehensive case yet why Comey's actions gave Trump valid cause to dismiss him. This ain't over The IG report has been hotly anticipated for months, but it does not conclude the saga over DOJ, the FBI and the 2016 presidential election. In fact, far from it \u2014 the report found there were more FBI employees, whom it did not identify, who sent and received political text messages that investigators said brought \"discredit\" upon them and the bureau. As the FBI and members of Congress continue to pull that thread, those investigations could uncover more material that embarrasses the bureau again. Also, Horowitz himself is due on Capitol Hill next week to talk in person with members of Congress about his findings. The lingering frustrations about the Justice Department, the FBI, Comey and the 2016 saga among both Republicans and Democrats mean that fireworks are likely.",

The Russia imbroglio has brought Washington, D.C., to a crossroads that could have historic implications for President Trump and the nation. Justice Department special counsel Robert Mueller wants to interview Trump about what he knows and why he has acted in the way he has. The president and his attorneys have all but ruled that out. The president denies any wrongdoing. Which side will blink? If Trump and the White House stick by their decision not to give Mueller an interview, the special counsel has a choice of his own: Will he accept the arguments made by Trump's attorneys that he already knows everything Trump could tell him and stand down? Or will Mueller choose a path seldom traveled and issue a subpoena to try to compel Trump to sit for an interview? Here's what you need to know about how we got here \u2014 and what might come next. The president's attorneys now acknowledge \u2014 despite earlier denials by the White House \u2014 that he dictated a statement to The New York Times about the June 2016 meeting at Trump Tower at which his top campaign deputies hosted a delegation dispatched by the Russian government. (Read more about that meeting here.) The meeting followed an offer of help to Donald Trump Jr. from the Russian government via a series of intermediaries. When the Times was on the verge of reporting on the meeting, Trump Jr. initially said \u2014 in the statement written by Trump senior \u2014 that the meeting was mostly about \"adoptions.\" Later, Trump Jr. released the emails in which the session had been organized. Last month, it became clear that the Russians used the meeting to give Trump aides a political opposition research tip, although not one, according to the accounts of the participants, the Russians had initially promised about Hillary Clinton. For two reasons: First, Trump's direct involvement is important if Mueller is building a case that the president has been engaged in a pattern of deception or other behavior that amounts to obstruction of justice. Prosecutors might group this together with other examples since Inauguration Day. And second, it raises questions about how closely Trump has been involved all along with the contacts between people in his campaign and Russian operatives. Trump has said he wasn't aware that Russia was attacking the presidential election in 2016 or that his aides were interacting with Russians at that time. Trump himself has been described as not a target of the FBI's investigation. But the Senate Judiciary Committee revealed last month that, as Trump Jr. was arranging the meeting at which he hosted his Russian guests, he made two phone calls to a blocked number. Trump Jr. told senators he didn't remember with whom he spoke. Trump senior is known to have used a blocked number. If Mueller's investigators established that Trump Jr. did, in fact, phone his father, that could suggest that Trump senior knew at the time of the meeting at least that it was taking place. That raises questions about how much else Trump knew about the overtures the Russian government had been making to his campaign since spring 2016. If Trump did know about what was happening \u2014 even if neither he nor his aides actually conspired with the ongoing Russian active measures \u2014 that might have given him an incentive to frustrate efforts by FBI investigators to find out about what his campaign aides had done or what he knew. Mueller's investigators want to ask about all this. Trump's lawyers have been resisting confidentially and they've also been litigating their case in the press. Trump's legal team argues not only that Trump did not break the law that prohibits obstructing justice, but that, in short, he cannot commit that crime: His actions as president all have been within the authority afforded him by the Constitution, the lawyers say. If he asked then-FBI Director James Comey to lay off the case of former national security adviser Michael Flynn, that was within Trump's power, they argue, because he can end any investigation for any reason. And the Constitution also gives Trump the privilege to fire Comey or nearly anyone else under him in the executive branch, the president's legal team says, for any reason.

And Trump not only couldn't have obstructed justice, according to this line of argument, the president argued on Monday that even if he had broken any law, he has the power to pardon himself. Trump, in claiming that privilege, stopped short of saying he might use it, and his attorney, Rudy Giuliani, said separately that the president recognized that pardoning himself might bring on a severe political backlash. All the same, the manifold claims about executive power appear to add up to a message to the special counsel: Trump has not and cannot do anything wrong in this context and even if he had, he has the authority to make all this go away. So what comes next? The special counsel's office simply could drop its request for an interview with Trump. Mueller then could do whatever other work he believes he has set out for him. No one knows whether Mueller intends to file charges against other people in the Russia case \u2014 for example, to indict the Russian cyber-operatives who stole emails from the Democratic National Committee and other political targets in 2016 and then arranged for them to be released to embarrass their targets. Mueller also must compile a written report about the Russian attack on the 2016 election and the subsequent events. The governing regulations oblige Mueller to submit his report to Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, who appointed him, but Rosenstein has no obligation of his own to give the report to Congress or make it public. (The regulations do, however, appear to require Rosenstein to notify the chairmen and ranking members of both the House and Senate Judiciary Committees when the special counsel's investigation is concluded.) If, however, the investigation results in a book-length \"Mueller Report,\" as there have been major reports by past congressional committees or special prosecutors, it could eventually find its way into the light of day. At the very least, Mueller finally might tell the full story of the Russian attack on the 2016 presidential election, about which many questions remain. If Mueller has found no wrongdoing by the president, he also could clear Trump and the nation could move on. Or if Mueller discovers wrongdoing, he could put the onus for action on Congress or voters; it would be up to the democratic process to deal with Trump if Mueller argued the president had transgressed somehow. The Justice Department might also signal whether it planned to file charges against Trump once he no longer was president \u2014 either because he had been removed by Congress, voters or his term limit \u2014 given the orthodox view within DOJ that it cannot indict a sitting president. If the president won't agree to an interview that Mueller felt would address his questions, Mueller's office could obtain a subpoena from a grand jury. That would seek to compel Trump to sit for the interview, but no one knows what might happen next. In the case of President Bill Clinton, the White House responded to a subpoena by negotiating an interview in the White House with independent counsel Ken Starr. Clinton agreed to appear before the grand jury via closed-circuit TV, rather than having to physically go to a federal courthouse. Starr withdrew the subpoena. So although presidents have done interviews with high-level investigators in the past, the legal assertions that Trump's lawyers have made about his powers and privileges have never actually been tested in a court battle in modern times. Of course. But there are political implications \u2014 in the past, Trump has criticized taking the Fifth as a de facto admission of guilt. Yes. If Trump's attorneys were determined to fight, they could ask a federal judge to throw out the subpoena. They could make arguments like the ones they reportedly made in their letter to Mueller's office: that, first, the Constitution confers on the president unique powers and responsibilities that protect him from a subpoena and, second, that the special counsel's office has already received all the information it would get from Trump in other ways. That puts the ball in Mueller's court. Giuliani said on Sunday that although the door isn't completely closed to an interview, he and Trump are strongly leaning against one \u2014 as has been the case for weeks. No matter what happens, no meeting between Trump and Mueller's team would take place until after Trump's planned summit in Singapore on June 12, Giuliani said. There's no telling \u2014 even if the Supreme Court agreed to hear arguments about the matter on an expedited basis given the importance of the case. The high court would stand at a crossroads of its own: If it recognized Trump's assertion that the president can reject a subpoena, it would be a historic vindication and add yet more power to an office that has been gaining in its reach since President Franklin Roosevelt. If the Supreme Court ordered Trump to appear before a grand jury \u2014 either in person or in a Clinton-like arrangement via video \u2014 that would be a historic move all on its own. That could take months or years, but the relevant decisions by Trump, his lawyers, Mueller and his office could take place within the next few weeks.",

Updated at 10:27 p.m. ET Donald Trump's personal attorney, Michael Cohen, may have received hundreds of thousands of dollars in payments from both corporate clients and potentially a Russian billionaire, according to new allegations from an attorney suing them. Michael Avenatti, who represents adult film actress Stormy Daniels, described what he called Cohen's suspicious financial relationships in a document released on Tuesday evening. Avenatti did not release the primary source materials that he used to draft his \"executive summary,\" but at least three companies confirmed to NPR independently that they had hired Cohen or the shell company he formed to make the payment to Daniels that he has acknowledged. The claims in Avenatti's document would, among other things, undercut accounts that Trump, Cohen and attorney Rudy Giuliani have given about the payments made to Daniels. The document \u2014 if substantiated \u2014 describes a previously unknown relationship between Cohen and interests associated with Russian oligarch Viktor Vekselberg. It also depicts what amounted to an influence business in which Cohen may have essentially acted as a lobbyist based on his relationship with Trump. An attorney for Cohen did not respond to a request for comment. The White House had made no comment on the Avenatti claims on Tuesday evening. The origins of the money Avenatti grabbed headlines by saying that it may have been Vekselberg, not Trump, who reimbursed Cohen for a $130,000 payment to Daniels. Vekselberg, one of Russia's richest men, reportedly has been stopped and questioned on his way into the United States by investigators working for Justice Department special counsel Robert Mueller, who are conducting an investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 presidential race and any ties between the Trump campaign and Russia. Daniels says Cohen paid her in 2016 just before Election Day for an agreement in which she would not talk about the sexual encounter she says she had with Trump a decade earlier. Daniels hired Avenatti to sue Cohen and Trump to escape that agreement. Trump denies Daniels' claims about a sexual encounter, but he acknowledged last week that he had reimbursed Cohen for a $130,000 payment to Daniels. Trump's attorney, Giuliani, said on TV that Trump didn't know at the time exactly what his retainer to Cohen was actually paying for, but Trump has since undercut Giuliani's account without giving his own version of events. Now, Avenatti's \"executive summary\" asks whether a $500,000 payment allegedly from Vekselberg, described by Avenatti's document as being routed through an American company he controls, might actually have been the way that Cohen was reimbursed for paying Daniels. Avenatti said on CNN on Tuesday evening that he has a team of investigators working on discovery as part of Daniels' lawsuit and that is how he uncovered the information about the payments to Cohen. \"We're 100 percent confident ... or we would not have released this,\" he told cable news anchor Anderson Cooper. The underlying documents \u2014 payment records, bank statements or other material \u2014 are not public so there was no way to independently verify the allegation. Some news organizations reported on Tuesday they had reviewed the source materials. Three companies in the Avenatti summary confirmed their relationships with Cohen to NPR, substantiating at least those portions of Avenatti's allegations. That relationship between Cohen's company and AT&T could be significant because in October 2016, AT&T announced that it wanted to buy media conglomerate Time Warner. Time Warner is the parent company of frequent Trump target CNN, and the Trump administration opposes the merger. Unanswered questions The financial relationships alleged in Avenatti's \"executive summary\" may not be nefarious or illegal, but if all of them were substantiated it would add considerably to the public understanding about the business Cohen has been conducting since Trump's election. Federal prosecutors in the Southern District of New York have been pursuing a criminal investigation of Cohen for months, one they say focuses on his business dealings. But Cohen is battling with prosecutors over evidence in that case and the Manhattan U.S. Attorney's Office has not yet charged Cohen with a crime. Cohen cited his criminal case when he told another federal judge in California, in the lawsuit that Avenatti has brought there on behalf of Daniels, that he would invoke his Fifth Amendment privilege not to incriminate himself because of the ongoing criminal investigation in New York, and so that judge agreed to freeze that suit until this summer. The material supporting Avenatti's \"executive summary,\" if substantiated, could show a direct financial relationship between Cohen and a powerful Russian at a time when Justice Department special counsel Robert Mueller is investigating whether the Trump campaign may have conspired with the Russian attack on the 2016 election. Cohen played an important role in that campaign but has denied vigorously that there was any conspiracy with Russians. Trump also denies there was any collusion between his campaign and Russia's active measures against the 2016 presidential race. The president points to the report of the Republican majority on the House intelligence committee \u2014 that cleared Trump and his campaign of any wrongdoing \u2014 and says the ongoing Mueller and Senate intelligence committee investigations amount to a \"witch hunt.\"",

As a businessman, Donald Trump was not shy about jumping into the trenches for litigious battles large and small. In fact, he seemed to almost relish the fight. The game has changed, however, since Trump won the White House, and his enthusiasm for such scraps may have waned as the legal challenges facing him have piled up. It's all a distraction, Trump says, from the real work of his administration. \"This country is, right now, running so smooth,\" he told reporters on Friday. \"And to be bringing up that kind of crap, and to be bringing up witch hunts all the time \u2014 that's all you want to talk about.\" The White House is facing a drumbeat of questions and stories related to everything from possible campaign payments chicanery to alleged dalliances with a Playboy playmate and a porn star. The biggest headache is Justice Department special counsel Robert Mueller's Russia investigation. The former FBI director and his team are probing possible coordination between the Trump campaign and Russia's attack on the 2016 election. But Trump's legal troubles don't end there. He also faces lawsuits brought by women who accuse him of defamation, among other things, while a federal investigation into his longtime personal lawyer has opened up yet-another potentially damaging front. Here's what you need to know about the president's various legal cases and the potential threats they pose. The lawsuits Summer Zervos, a onetime contestant on Donald Trump's show The Apprentice, is suing him for defamation, saying he wrongfully accused her of being a liar when she and several other women came forward with sexual misconduct allegations.\n                \n                    \n                    Kathy Willens/AP\n                    \n                \nhide caption Summer Zervos, a onetime contestant on Donald Trump's show The Apprentice, is suing him for defamation, saying he wrongfully accused her of being a liar when she and several other women came forward with sexual misconduct allegations. Trump is being sued by two women \u2014 Summer Zervos, a former contestant on his old show, The Apprentice, and porn actress Stormy Daniels. The Daniels matter has received far more media attention, in part because of the relentless cable TV appearances by her lawyer, Michael Avenatti. But the Zervos suit before the New York Supreme Court (the trial court in the state) is further along legally, having already survived a motion to dismiss it. It may, in fact, be the more immediate danger to the president. Zervos is suing Trump for defamation, saying he wrongfully accused her of being a liar when she and several other women came forward with sexual misconduct allegations against Trump. The president denies the claims. This week in the Zervos case, subpoenas were issued to media company Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, which owns the archives of The Apprentice, and the Beverly Hills Hotel, where Zervos says Trump groped her. \"We're gathering evidence that we believe will prove that the defendant lied when he falsely denigrated Ms. Zervos and when he denied sexually assaulting her,\" Zervos' lawyer, Mariann Wang, told The New York Times. Daniels, meanwhile, has two lawsuits pending against Trump. She filed a defamation suit on Monday. Daniels, whose given name is Stephanie Clifford, says Trump defamed her when he said on Twitter that the sketch of a man who she says threatened her in 2011 was a \"total con job.\" In a separate suit, Daniels also is suing Trump to get out of a nondisclosure agreement she signed a month before the 2016 election to keep silent about her alleged sexual encounter with Trump. The president's longtime personal lawyer, Michael Cohen, and the shell company Cohen set up to make that $130,000 payment to Daniels, are also named in the suit. The federal judge presiding over this case put the matter on hold for 90 days at Cohen's request in light of the criminal investigation in New York City into Cohen's business dealings. Zervos' and Daniels' cases are civil, not criminal, but they still pose a measure of risk to the president. If they reach the discovery phase, the plaintiffs can request documents and depositions, including from the president. That could be embarrassing for Trump, lawyers say. \"What you usually find in depositions is that questions are wide-ranging, and they do sometimes go into personal matters,\" said Roscoe C. Howard Jr., a former U.S. attorney who is now a partner with Barnes and Thornburg. \"There could be some areas where they go into some pretty meaty things for the president.\" Trump's financial documents, for example, also could be subject to discovery in these cases, as could any payments \u2014 if they exist \u2014 made to other women on Trump's behalf. The Cohen matter Cohen is a wild card. He worked as Trump's personal lawyer and fixer for about a decade, but he has also had his hands in a range of other business ventures. The FBI raided Cohen's residences and office in April as part of a criminal investigation into his business affairs. Agents seized boxes of documents, electronic devices and other items. It's unclear, at this point, what is in those materials. Investigators haven't looked through them yet because of a dispute over attorney-client privilege. An independent attorney known as a special master has been appointed by the court to review the items and determine what is protected by attorney-client privilege and what is not. Materials that are not protected will be handed over to prosecutors for their investigation. They'll likely use it in drafting an indictment against Cohen, who so far has not been charged. Trump lashed out after the raid, calling it a disgrace and an attack on the country. He has hired another lawyer to represent him in the case and to try to shield his communications and documents from investigators. What is clear is that federal investigators in Manhattan have been building a case against Cohen for months as part of a grand jury investigation into his business practices. And they had enough evidence already to persuade a judge to grant them a search warrant of the office of not just an attorney, but the president's attorney, which is a high bar to clear. Once prosecutors are able to sift through the materials they recovered in the raids, one question that may emerge is whether they have so much evidence they could ask Cohen to accept a deal in which he would plead guilty and cooperate with them against Trump. \"You put as much pressure on an individual in Cohen's position as you can, with the idea that they will tell you everything that they know,\" Howard said.

Mueller's Russia investigation is the most significant legal challenge hanging over the president. Mueller's team has charged 19 people and three Russian entities. Prosecutors have secured five guilty pleas, including from former national security adviser Michael Flynn and former deputy campaign chairman Rick Gates, both of whom admitted they lied to the FBI. Trump and his allies in Congress have repeatedly attacked the Mueller probe, calling it a political hit job aimed at kneecapping his presidency. At the same time, White House lawyer Ty Cobb had tried to walk a cooperative line with the investigation by voluntarily providing thousands of administration documents and making staffers available for interviews. That spirit of cooperation may be coming to an end, however, with the recent shake-up of the president's legal team. The White House announced this week that Cobb will be departing by the end of the month and will be replaced by another well-known Washington, D.C., lawyer, Emmet Flood. Flood defended President Bill Clinton during his impeachment and advised President George W. Bush during investigations into the firing of federal prosecutors. In his past work, Flood has staunchly defended administration claims of executive privilege. The other notable recent addition to the legal team is Rudy Giuliani, the former New York City mayor and onetime U.S. attorney for the Southern District of New York. Giuliani took an aggressive stance toward the Russia investigation, repeatedly describing it as a \"witch hunt\" and calling for it to be shut down. The relationship stumbled, however, when Trump undercut Giuliani's accounts of events about the payment to Daniels, which prompted an attempt by Giuliani to \"clarify\" them. Taken together, however, the arrival of Flood and Giuliani appear to signal a more adversarial approach from the White House toward the special counsel's office.",

This week in the Russia investigations: After a lot of Sturm und Drang, the door appears to be closing on an interview between President Trump and Justice Department special counsel Robert Mueller. At the conclusion of another outrageous dust devil week of news, here is the main thing to take away: An interview between President Trump and the team of Justice Department special counsel Robert Mueller now appears less likely than ever. The road to reach this point was wild \u2014 it involved a war of leaks and counter-leaks in the press, an explosive media tour by one of Trump's new lawyers, former New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani, and then a bravura quasi-reverse double salchow by Trump himself on Friday. The upshot of it all is that Trump and his attorneys appear to have concluded the week in stronger alignment: the risks are too great for the president to sit down with Mueller or his investigators. They're hopelessly biased and running a \"pure witch hunt,\" as Trump said. If he could only be assured they would be fair, he told reporters, he'd be glad to cooperate \u2014 but who could ever make such an assurance? Besides, Trump's attorneys and his outside advisers have been counseling him for months not to talk with Mueller. Giuliani began this week as the biggest apparent advocate for an interview inside the Trump camp. Then The New York Times printed the list of nearly 50 topic areas that Mueller's team has told Trump's lawyers it wants to address. The command of detail and breadth of knowledge required by Trump would necessitate days' worth of meetings. Trump is not known for being a crisp, precise speaker, observers have noted. Any misstep that could open him up to charges of having lied to investigators makes the interview dangerous, at least politically if not legally. In their public comments, Giuliani and Trump have tried to keep open the idea that they'd cooperate with what they consider a reasonable request \u2014 two to three hours tops, as Giuliani said. They probably know the special counsel's office wouldn't agree. If that is so, and Trump still doesn't budge, it raises the question about what action he and his attorneys will take, of which more below. For now, if this remains the president's position, it could have one of two consequences: it could either speed up the Russia imbroglio and bring forward milestones that might not have transpired for several more months ... or, it could do the exact opposite and extend this saga by a year or more. No one but Mueller and his team truly knows what they know and what they intend in this affair. If, as has been surmised, Mueller's investigation is mostly complete and Trump is the last interview that Mueller wants \u2014 and it becomes clear he won't get it \u2014 the special counsel's office could simply bring its work to a close. If, as has been surmised, Mueller does not or never intended to try to indict Trump, because he doesn't believe the Justice Department has that power, Mueller's team then could file its report about alleged collusion or alleged obstruction, or both, or neither, and make clear that it couldn't address the questions that only Trump could answer. That could mean the Justice Department's investigation phase of the Russia imbroglio might be over in a matter of weeks. No one knows what would follow: Mueller will file a confidential report to the Justice Department; maybe it would become public \u2014 maybe not. The galaxy of questions that Mueller's office formulated for Trump suggests how central the president's evidence remains to whatever the special counsel is building. That may mean that if Trump won't play nice, Mueller might play hardball. The special counsel could obtain a subpoena that would compel Trump to give evidence or appear before a grand jury. And Trump could ask a judge in the case to quash it. That might require a battle in court that could stretch for months or more, winding up ultimately in the Supreme Court. Legal experts argue that, ultimately, the White House would probably lose, but it might take a long time to get there. (And then what would happen? Would U.S. marshals knock down the door to the White House and drag Trump down to federal court? Even the end of the case wouldn't be the end of the story.) Or Trump could invoke his Fifth Amendment right not to give evidence that would require he incriminate himself. He enjoys that privilege under the Constitution. That might take us back up to the fast way, above, if it ended the matter \u2014 but it would also represent a political gamble by the president and his advisers. That doesn't mean they might not try it. Although Trump has opined that people who take the Fifth look like they're guilty, Trump also has seldom felt bound by his past comments. Plus he and his allies have spent months scourging Mueller, the FBI and the Justice Department. Their reputations have taken a major hit. So among the political supporters that Trump cares about, not cooperating with Mueller isn't just logical, it's imperative \u2014 Mueller, Justice and the feds, viewed through this prism, are grand inquisitors run amok on a scurrilous witch hunt. That's also why Trump has held open the possibility of using his own power to take some action against the Justice Department, either by dismissing Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein or Mueller or some other way. That strategy also would involve political risk and based on the time, temperature and barometric pressure in Washington, D.C., it might be a bridge too far. Or, direct action by the president might make political sense depending on how strongly he and his advisers felt about the way they've shaped the political landscape. Trump's most loyal supporters stay with him no matter what. They and many Republicans in Congress say the FBI and the Justice Department are warrens of treachery that have been conspiring for years to frame the president. Resistance is the only thing that makes sense. Giuliani gave a sense of the confidence of the Trump camp this week when he acknowledged that Trump had reimbursed his lawyer, Michael Cohen, for a $130,000 payment made to porn actress Stormy Daniels before the 2016 election. Giuliani even asked Fox News to imagine what would have happened if Daniels' allegations had been public ahead of Election Day, connecting Trump's payment to Daniels, via Cohen, directly to the 2016 campaign. Trump then confirmed the payments the following day on Twitter, while denying Daniels' underlying claim about a sexual encounter with him. Think about that: The president and his aides acknowledged that he had paid a porn star to keep her quiet and avoid embarrassment. In doing so, Giuliani also may have admitted that the Trump campaign violated federal campaign finance laws in the way it handled these payments, although he later argued that was not so. In this case, these are the actions of a chief executive and an administration profoundly confident about retaining their core political support. As long as that persists, look for Trump and the White House to fight Mueller, not accommodate him.",

The White House announced Tuesday that Trump would not be taking a planned trip to Latin America this week.\n                \n                    \n                    The Washington Post/Getty Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption President Trump speaks to the media during a Cabinet meeting at the White House on Monday. The White House announced Tuesday that Trump would not be taking a planned trip to Latin America this week. President Trump has canceled his planned trip to Latin America this week. The commander in chief and his advisers are deciding on a response to the Syrian government's alleged chemical weapons attack on its own people. And closer to home, the office of the president's personal lawyer was raided by the FBI on Monday. So Trump is staying put, the White House says. \"The president will remain in the United States to oversee the American response to Syria and to monitor developments around the world,\" White House press secretary Sarah Sanders said in a statement Tuesday. Vice President Pence will make the trip to the Summit of the Americas in Peru instead, Sanders said. \"Nothing is off the table\" News of a suspected chemical attack, said to have killed dozens in Douma, has sparked international outrage. Calling the attack \"horrible,\" Trump has pledged to respond \"forcefully.\" \"We can't let atrocities like we all witnessed \u2014 and you can see that and it's horrible \u2014 we can't let that happen,\" Trump said at the start of a meeting with senior military leadership on Monday, including his new national security adviser John Bolton. Earlier in the day, Trump held a meeting with members of his Cabinet, where he told reporters that his administration would be making \"some major decisions over the next 24 to 48 hours\" regarding the response to Syria. \"Nothing is off the table,\" Trump said, when asked about a military response. Trump also spoke to French President Emmanuel Macron in a phone call on Monday. It was the second call between the two leaders since the alleged Syrian attack. Trump and Macron have agreed to coordinate a \"strong, joint response.\" The White House has not released any details about what that response might look like. Following a chemical attack in northern Syria last year, Trump launched airstrikes against Syria. Last week, Trump said the United States was strongly considering taking U.S. troops out of Syria. Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., said in a statement on Sunday that Trump had emboldened the Syrian government by making it seem the United States was taking its attention away. Sanders pushed back against that assertion during a press briefing on Monday. \"The president has made clear that, with the defeat of [the Islamic State terror group], he wanted to be able to bring our troops home,\" Sanders said. \"But at the same time, he wants to make sure that [Syrian President Bashar Assad] is deterred from chemical weapons attacks on innocent civilians, and we think you can have separation.\" Pressure at home Trump's focus on Tuesday, at least publicly, was not on Syria \u2014 it was on the special counsel's investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election and whether the president's campaign coordinated with the Russians. The FBI seized a number of materials from Trump's longtime lawyer Michael Cohen on Monday, after prosecutors in New York received a referral from special counsel Robert Mueller's team, Cohen's attorney said. Early Tuesday morning, Trump tweeted that \"attorney-client privilege is dead!\" Attorney\u2013client privilege is dead! Although the privilege shields much of what takes place between a lawyer and a client, it does not provide a defense against criminal activity or fraud. A special team of Justice Department officials is now expected to begin working through the materials seized by the FBI from Cohen to determine what still is covered by attorney-client privilege and what, if there were some evidence of wrongdoing, could eventually be submitted as evidence in court. Separately on Tuesday the president's new national security adviser, John Bolton, appeared to be making personnel changes as he remakes the staff following his arrival on Monday. To that end, the White House announced the departure of homeland security adviser Tom Bossert.",

(Photo by Morgan Lieberman/Anadolu Agency/Getty Images) Voting ballots for the upcoming 2018 midterm elections will feature a record number of female candidates. Despite the influx of women interested in political office, men still dominate most leadership roles in the United States. Fewer than 1 in 5 members of Congress are women. At Fortune 500 companies, fewer than 1 in 20 CEOs are women. And if you look at all the presidents of the United States through Donald Trump, what are the odds of having 45 presidents who are all men? If men and women had an equal shot at the White House, the odds of this happening just by chance are about 1 in 36 trillion. What explains the dearth of women in top leadership positions? Is it bias, a lack of role models, the old boy's club? Sure. But it goes even deeper. Research suggests American women are trapped in a paradox that is deeply embedded in our culture. \"It is really the very, very fine line of being a shrew on one hand and a puppet on the other that any woman in public life has to walk,\" says former U.S. Sen. Carol Moseley Braun, a Democrat from Illinois. So what's a woman to do? Be nice and kind and friendly, as our gender stereotypes about women require? Or be tough and decisive, as our stereotypes about leadership demand? To be one is to be seen as nice, but weak. To be the other is to be seen as competent, but unlikable.

On Feb. 25, Schiff released a memo responding to a previous Republican memo about the investigation of President Trump's 2016 campaign.\n                \n                    \n                    Win McNamee/Getty Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption Rep. Adam Schiff, D-Calif., the top Democrat on the House intelligence committee, leaves a committee meeting at the U.S. Capitol Feb. 5, 2018 in Washington, DC. On Feb. 25, Schiff released a memo responding to a previous Republican memo about the investigation of President Trump's 2016 campaign. After nearly a month of pronouncements, melodrama, headlines and strife, Round One of memo mania is finally complete. House Intelligence Committee Republicans went first with their Feb. 2 salvo that alleged \"biased\" FBI and Justice Department officials had abused their surveillance powers by withholding information from the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court. Then, on Saturday, committee Democrats released a rebuttal giving their perspective on the story \u2014 or at least part of it. One privilege enjoyed by intelligence committee chairman Devin Nunes, R-Calif., is that his majority on the panel, and the presence of allies in the executive branch, meant he could arrange for his memo to be released swiftly and in full. The minority response by ranking member Adam Schiff took weeks and was partly redacted, with large sections blacked out to conceal secret information. Even though the countermemo is incomplete, it includes several points of interest that advance the never-ending story of the Russia imbroglio. 1.The FBI has corroborated parts of the Russia dossier The potential case that Donald Trump's campaign may have conspired with the Russian attack on the 2016 election has always been about more than the infamous dossier. Trump and his supporters deny colluding and make the dossier a favorite target because of its salacious contents and because it remained unverified. NPR and other news organizations have not detailed the contents of the dossier because it remains unproven, but Schiff's memo suggests that the Justice Department actually has corroborated parts of it. Which parts? That is blacked out. So there is no way to know whether it's some of the anodyne background aspects of the file \u2014 or the more infamous passages. All the same, it is significant that the Justice Department has established for its own purposes that at least some of the contents of the dossier aren't either simply false or Russian disinformation. 2. The feds collected \"valuable intelligence\" from Carter Page Onetime Trump adviser Carter Page is the main character of the dueling memos. For Republicans, he is a civil liberties martyr who was cruelly wronged by \"biased\" FBI and DoJ officials who duped a judge into authorizing intrusive surveillance against him. Schiff's memo makes a very different case. It not only cites Page's years-long flirtations with Russia's foreign intelligence service, the SVR, but highlights what it calls the worthwhile information yielded by spying on him. The Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act requires that warrants produce something. The FBI can't keep one going if the subject of the surveillance isn't talking with people of interest or involved with clandestine activities. Page evidently was. That's why it was significant that Justice Department officials from the administration of President Obama and into that of President Trump, including Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, signed the applications to reauthorize the surveillance on Page. Although it was possible to surmise before that the spying was producing evidence, Schiff's memo confirms that explicitly. \"The Court-approved surveillance of Page allowed FBI to collect valuable intelligence,\" it says. What did the feds learn? Those sections are blacked out. Phrases that do appear in this section, however, include \"repeatedly contacted\" and \"contradict his sworn testimony\" to the intelligence committee. 3. The FBI investigated other people in Trump world Page's case has become well known. So has the story of another junior foreign policy adviser to the Trump campaign, George Papadopoulos, who was importuned by Russian agents offering help to Trump. But the FBI has been investigating more people in the Trump camp, according to the Democrats' countermemo. Schiff's memo describes how material from the dossier didn't begin to reach the FBI unit running its counterintelligence investigation into Trump and Russia until seven weeks after it had begun its work. Then the memo says this: \"By then, the FBI had already opened sub-inquiries into [redacted] individuals linked to the Trump campaign: [redacted]\" and Page. This is important for a few reasons. One, the wording of this passages suggests at least three or four subjects. Two, it doesn't seem to suggest that Trump himself was the subject of a \"sub-inquiry,\" verifying a defense he has offered several times. Three, it suggests these other people might have been the subject of government surveillance in addition to Page \u2014 and that raises the question about whether the FBI might still be monitoring people in Trump's orbit today, including within his family or the White House. 4. Republicans have not budged from their earlier attack Schiff and Democrats use much of their memo to defend the FBI and Justice Department. The agencies made appropriate disclosures to the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court in asking to surveil Page, the Democrats argue, and Republicans' other attacks are \"irrelevant.\" Nunes continues to argue they are, in fact, pretty relevant. His statement on Saturday continued to focus on what he called the abuse of power in Page's case, including what he said were the FBI's failures to give all the relevant information it had about the Democratic-underwritten dossier and Page's own record. \"The American people now clearly understand that the FBI used political dirt paid for by the Democratic Party to spy on an American citizen from the Republican Party,\" Nunes said. The White House, meanwhile, complained that Democrats omitted in their memo that former Deputy FBI Director Andrew McCabe had said that the dossier was the basis for the FISA application on Page. Schiff's memo does make its own case in that point and argues the FBI would have continued its investigation of the Russian attack and Page without the dossier. This back-and-forth is important because although the Russia imbroglio is moving on \u2014 with new indictments brought by Justice Department special counsel Robert Mueller, new guilty pleas and other such developments \u2014 the political attack lines, so far, have not. 5. The template has been established for memo madness The more a game is played, the more adept teams become at its rules and strategies. Basketball defenders deliberately foul an opponent to force a free-throw. A manager brings up a left-handed reliever to pitch inside to a dangerous left-handed hitter. The Republican memo gambit and last weekend's Democratic riposte complete the first enactment of what could become a recurring sideshow inside Washington. The majority uses its control of the committee and its alliances inside the executive branch to release an unexpurgated file even if some of the relevant agencies object \u2014 as the FBI and Justice objected to the release of the Nunes memo. The minority can't twist the arms of the agencies controlled by its opponents and it can't get parity with the opening shot: Nunes' memo was released by lunchtime on a Friday following a week of extensive coverage. Schiff's memo came out with no preliminary fanfare on a Saturday afternoon. So will this be the template for each game? Or will Nunes and Schiff take a different approach next time? And with the rules more or less set, how will other players respond? Round Two is already different: Nunes suggested he was preparing another memo about what he calls problems with President Obama's State Department. So a former State official wrote a column in the Washington Post that tried to short-circuit that attack. With Round One of memo v. countermemo now complete, the stage is now set for new permutations of the game that may last as long as the Russia saga itself.",

            "article_content": "1 of 14 Billy Graham, the most famous minister of his era, died Wednesday at his home in Montreat, N.C., spokesman Todd Shearer tells NPR. In his 99 years, Graham changed the face of evangelical Christianity in America. Though he spent his final years in failing health and largely silent at his mountaintop cabin in North Carolina, Graham for more than six decades was in constant motion. He preached to more than 200 million people in 185 countries, counseled presidents and led mass religious rallies that featured professional musicians and huge choirs, in venues ranging from a circus tent in Los Angeles to Yankee Stadium in New York. His influence as a moral and spiritual leader in 20th century America was such that one historian said Billy Graham could confer \"acceptability on wars, shame on racial prejudice, desirability on decency, dishonor on indecency, and prestige on civic events.\" Graham's fame and popularity, however, derived first from his passionate preaching style, which was partly a product of his upbringing. Evangelist Billy Graham preaches to over half a million South Koreans in Seoul in 1973.\n                \n                    \n                    AP\n                    \n                \nhide caption He grew up milking cows and pitching hay on his family farm just outside Charlotte, N.C.. His parents were pious Presbyterians who led their children in prayer before every meal and insisted that they learn a new Bible verse each day. As a boy, Billy did not rebel against that religious discipline, but he was soon attracted to a more raucous form of worship. After attending a few outdoor revival meetings, he decided his Christian calling was to be a Bible-waving preacher like the ones who came through Charlotte in pursuit of lost souls. He subsequently left Presbyterianism to affiliate with the Southern Baptist denomination. In his determination to replicate the evangelical style, Graham read the sermons of notable preachers and then practiced delivering them himself. According to his biographer, William Martin, Graham regularly closed himself in a tool shed and \"preached to oil cans and lawnmowers. Or he paddled a canoe to a lonely spot on the river and called on snakes and alligators and tree stumps to repent of their sins and accept Jesus.\" After graduating from Wheaton College in Illinois, where he met his future wife Ruth, Graham led a Baptist congregation in a Chicago suburb, but he didn't stay there long. Congregational work was not for him. He wanted to reach a bigger audience, and he had the preaching talent to do so. His big break came in 1949, when Graham led what he called \"a tent campaign\" of revival meetings in Los Angeles. Roaming the stage, chopping the air with his hands, and speaking alternately fast and slow, he electrified his audiences. \"The Lord Jesus Christ can be received, your sins forgiven, your burdens lifted, your problems solved, by turning your life over to him,\" Graham shouted, before leading the crowd in prayer. Originally scheduled for three weeks, the Los Angeles meetings were so popular that the organizers extended them to eight weeks. More than 350,000 people are said to have attended the services, in part because of favorable press coverage that came on the orders of newspaper publisher William Randolph Hearst. After hearing Graham preach, Hearst sent a two-word instruction to his editors: \"Puff Graham.\" Before long, he was famous around the country. His wife thought he was too loud and too theatrical, but in midcentury America it was a style that worked. As a handsome, blue-eyed young preacher, he projected wholesomeness and charisma. He could command the stage, and his delivery proved perfect for radio and television. The evangelists who preceded Graham had a mainly regional appeal, whether in the South or the North, but Graham was known as \"America's pastor.\" During a 4-month-long \"crusade\" in New York City, more than 2 million people came to hear him in various venues, including Madison Square Garden. Each service ended with Graham urging people to come forward, stand before him and dedicate their lives to Christ as a 1000-voice choir sang, \"Just As I Am, Without One Plea,\" the hymn that served as his anthem. Graham and his wife, Ruth, in London in 1959.\n                \n                    \n                    AP\n                    \n                \nhide caption Graham and his wife, Ruth, in London in 1959. Whereas many previous evangelists had embraced a fiery fundamentalism, Graham was more inclusive. In an unusual twist for a Southern Baptist evangelical preacher, Graham coordinated his Madison Square Garden rally with some big New York churches. \"His determination to cooperate with mainline Protestants and with Roman Catholics alienated his fundamentalist friends,\" said Grant Wacker, a Duke Divinity School professor whose book America's Pastor: Billy Graham and the Shaping of a Nation  traces the social and political significance of Graham's preaching career. \"They took great offense that Graham was willing to cooperate with the enemy.\" Before long, Graham was one of the most famous and admired men in America. He became a regular White House visitor, meeting with every president from Harry Truman to Barack Obama and becoming a friend and counselor to several. Graham was especially close to Richard Nixon, a golfing buddy, though that friendship was diminished by the Watergate scandal. Graham initially refused to believe that Nixon was involved, but when the Watergate tapes showed otherwise, he was deeply disappointed. \"He recognized then that he had probably been used, that he had misunderstood something of the president's character,\" said biographer William Martin. \"That was a terrible blow to him and caused him to withdraw from the political arena.\" His friendship with Nixon caused Graham additional trouble years later, when a tape of a 1972 conversation revealed that Graham had told Nixon that American Jews had a \"stranglehold\" on the news media. When the tape was released 30 years later, Graham was horrified and begged forgiveness from U.S. Jewish leaders. \"He did not spin it. He did not try to justify it,\" Wacker said. \"He said repeatedly he had done wrong, and he was sorry.\" Virtually all the Jewish leaders with whom he spoke forgave him, Wacker said. More than 20,000 people packed New York's Madison Square Garden on June 13, 1969, to attend the opening of evangelist Billy Graham's 10-day crusade.\n                \n                    \n                    AP\n                    \n                \nhide caption More than 20,000 people packed New York's Madison Square Garden on June 13, 1969, to attend the opening of evangelist Billy Graham's 10-day crusade. Over the course of his career, Graham moved steadily toward more moderate positions. Having once tolerated separate black and white seating sections at his rallies, he later insisted that everyone be treated equally, and he invited Martin Luther King Jr. to offer a prayer at one of his Madison Square Garden rallies in 1957. Though not an aggressive campaigner on behalf of civil rights, Graham's support for racial integration earned him the enmity of the Ku Klux Klan and Southern segregationists. As a Southern Baptist minister, Graham supported his denomination's ban on women becoming pastors, but he later said he was prepared to accept their ordination. His daughter Anne Graham Lotz saw firsthand how her father's views evolved. In a 2011 interview with NPR, Graham Lotz said both her father and her mother were initially opposed when she told them she wanted to teach her own Bible class. \"The traditional role of women in my family had been that the mother stayed at home, reared the children, kept the house, so that the husband \u2013 father \u2013 could go out and do ministry, which was my mother and father's case,\" she said. \"So they just felt that my role was to stay at home and be that traditional type of wife and mother.\" As Billy Graham's daughter, Anne Graham faced a lot of pressure, but she went ahead with her Bible class anyway, without her parents' backing. One day, however, they showed up at her class unannounced, and from then on she had their full support. Later, Billy Graham said his daughter was the best preacher in the Graham family. \"I'll tell you what,\" Graham Lotz said in that NPR interview. \"I love my daddy. He is so special, and he's meant so much to me. It's not a thorn in my side to be known as Billy Graham's daughter. It's a privilege.\" I'm trying to stay out of it and just keep preaching the Gospel, because there's nothing coming out of Washington or any of those places that are going to save the world or transform men and women. It's Christ. Billy Graham 1987 After being embarrassed by his endorsement of Richard Nixon, Graham made a deliberate effort to stay clear of divisive issues. Speaking at a crusade in Denver in 1987, Graham said he had been asked by hundreds of news organizations to comment on \"certain things that have been happening in the world of religion. I haven't made a comment yet,\" Graham said to thunderous applause. A big religion story at the time was the rise of the Christian right. The Rev. Jerry Falwell, who founded the Moral Majority organization, was using his leadership position to mobilize conservative Christians in support of President Ronald Reagan and other Republican Party groups, but Graham kept his distance from such efforts. \"I'm trying to stay out of it and just keep preaching the Gospel, because there's nothing coming out of Washington or any of those places that are going to save the world or transform men and women. It's Christ,\" he said. Throughout his career, Graham made a determined effort to stay on message. Though conservative in his theology and pious in his personal life, he was reluctant to pass judgment on others. \"He did not think it was his job to criticize other traditions within Christianity, or outside Christianity for that matter,\" Wacker said. \"He insisted that his sole job was to proclaim the Gospel.\" In this regard, Graham differed not only from the conservative preachers who preceded him, but also from those who followed him, like Falwell or Pat Robertson or even his own son Franklin, all of whom seemed eager to wade into politics. Billy Graham's ministry, however, grew to be larger than himself, and it became harder to separate his views from the views of those who spoke on his behalf. The Billy Graham Evangelistic Association (BGEA), which he founded in 1950, produced radio and television programs and published books, magazines and pamphlets. A \"My Answer\" column that focused on moral and theological questions was actually written by association staff members, even though it appeared under Billy Graham's name.

Franklin Graham (from left), daughter Gigi Graham Tchvidijian, novelist Patricia Cornwell and actress Andie MacDowell celebrate Graham's 80th birthday in Asheville, N.C., on May 30, 2000. By the 1990s, the BGEA was run by Franklin Graham, Billy's designated successor, and Franklin's views differed sharply from his father's. Franklin called Islam \"a very evil and wicked religion,\" something his more temperate father never would have said. At a rally in 2003, shortly after the United States invaded Iraq, Billy Graham noted that Christianity shared a Middle Eastern homeland with Islam. \"A great deal of the Bible is in Iraq,\" he said. \"The Garden of Eden was there. Abraham was born there.\" Two years later, when a New York Times reporter asked him whether he shared his son's judgment on Islam, Graham answered, \"Let's say, I didn't say it.\" Asked whether he, like Franklin, foresaw a clash between Christianity and Islam, Graham said, \"I think the big conflict is with hunger and starvation and poverty.\" In that same 2005 interview, Graham reiterated the position he took in his 1987 rally in Colorado, noting that he did not want to talk about the political issues important to other evangelical conservatives, like abortion or homosexuality. \"I'm just going to preach the Gospel and am not going to get off on all these hot-button issues,\" he said. \"If I get on these other subjects, it divides the audience on an issue that is not the issue I'm promoting. I'm just promoting the Gospel.\" A dozen years earlier, in 1993, Graham had suggested that AIDS could be a \"judgment\" from God. \"I could not say for sure, but I think so,\" he said. Two weeks later, however, he apologized for the remark, saying \"I don't believe that, and I don't know why I said it.\" By the time of that 2005 interview, however, Franklin Graham had a larger public profile than his father had, and he was associating the Graham name with a more humanitarian agenda and with conservative political activism. Through his organization Samaritan's Purse, he devoted time and resources to charitable work in the United States and abroad. The organization in the coming years would provide aid in more than 100 countries, with an annual budget in excess of $500 million. In November 2013, on the occasion of his father's 95th birthday, Franklin Graham organized a huge celebration in Asheville, N.C., with more than 800 guests, largely from conservative Christian and Republican circles. Among those attending the celebration were Sarah Palin, Rupert Murdoch and Donald Trump. Franklin served as emcee for the event. His embrace of conservative Republican leaders culminated in his outspoken support for Donald Trump, whose election as president he attributed to \"divine providence.\" I'm just going to preach the Gospel and am not going to get off on all these hot-button issues. If I get on these other subjects, it divides the audience on an issue that is not the issue I'm promoting. I'm just promoting the Gospel. Billy Graham 2005 Controversy over the Billy Graham legacy was stirred anew with the 2015 publication of a book said to be Graham's \"final chapter.\" Titled Where I Am: Heaven, Eternity, And Our Life Beyond, the book had Billy Graham's name on the cover, as the author, but skeptics questioned whether he had actually written it. Despite the title, the book dealt less with heaven than with hell, describing it as \"a place of wailing and a furnace of fire; a place of torment, a place of outer darkness, a place where people scream for mercy; ... where many will spend eternity.\" During the months when the book was allegedly being written, Billy Graham was in failing health and suffering from severe memory loss due to hydrocephalus and Parkinson's disease. \"My personal view is that he had next to no involvement in the writing of that book,\" said Wacker, citing Graham's physical condition and also the book's fundamentalist message. \"That book reflected the views of the early Graham,\" he said, \"the late 40s, the early 50s. It did not reflect the views of the later Graham.\" In the book, hell is said to be \"the place of punishment for those who reject Christ,\" but in the later years of his ministry, Billy Graham had been unwilling to make such generalizations. Larry Ross tells Larry King about Billy Graham's unwavering stance on same-sex marriage. In a 2005 CNN interview with Larry King, Graham distanced himself from fundamentalists who passed judgment on people, telling King he could not say where non-Christians would spend eternity. \"That's not my calling,\" Graham said. \"My calling is to preach the love of God and the forgiveness of God. In my earlier ministry, I did the same, but as I got older I guess I became more mellow and more forgiving and more loving.\" The contrary view expressed in Where I Am, however, accorded closely with the views of Franklin Graham, who wrote the foreword to the book and handled all the publicity for it. When asked by NPR about the suspicion he had written the book under his father's name, Franklin Graham airily dismissed the idea. \"I don't have time to write my own books, much less my father's books,\" he said. \"There's no way.\" Graham's son, the Rev. Franklin Graham, talks to Fox News host Greta Van Susteren about his father's book in 2015. In an interview with Fox News, he said \"every word\" in the book was his father's. As for the fact that the view of hell expressed in the book seemed inconsistent with what Billy Graham had said in earlier interviews, Franklin said that as his father aged, \"he's going back more to the kind of convictions that he grew up with.\" There was no way to verify that claim, however, because Billy Graham himself never said a word about the book or its controversial message. In his final years, he appeared to have little control over what was said or done in his name. By the time of his death, Billy Graham had been out of the public eye for so many years that the younger evangelical generation had grown up without direct exposure to his ministry, and for many he was a relative stranger. Franklin Graham had taken his father's place. \"If God can be fully proved by the human mind, then He is no greater than the mind that proves Him.\" #BillyGraham The son would never match his father's fame or reputation, however. \"People who didn't like Billy Graham spent a lot of time trying to find personal violations of his moral and ethical code, and they couldn't,\" said Grant Wacker. \"They didn't exist. He was a man who maintained absolute marital fidelity and moral and financial integrity. He was an evangelist who lived the way he preached.\" As to whether there might be another Billy Graham, Wacker quoted C.S. Lewis: \"The one prayer God never answers is, Encore.\"",

The Georgia governor's race is already drawing people to the polls in record numbers, and a federal judge has just made it easier for even more voters in the state to cast a ballot. U.S. District Judge Eleanor Ross ruled on Friday the state must relax restrictions that could prevent more than 3,000 people, flagged under a controversial state law as potential noncitizens, from voting in Tuesday's midterm elections. The \"exact match\" law flags voter registrations that have discrepancies with other official identification documents used by the state. Mismatches can occur under the law for such reasons as missing hyphens, accent marks and middle initials. Those who are flagged can still vote if they settle the discrepancy by providing proof of identity. Those who are flagged as potential noncitizens must be approved by a deputy registrar before being allowed to vote. Civil rights groups filed suit, arguing that the law's requirements are part of a discriminatory voter suppression effort that disenfranchises predominantly minority voters. Brian Kemp, the Republican candidate for governor who also oversees the vote as Georgia's secretary of state, says the law is vital for election integrity. In her ruling, Ross said the requirements raised \"grave concerns for the Court about the differential treatment inflicted on a group of individuals who are predominantly minorities. ... The election scheme here places a severe burden on these individuals.\" Ross ruled that Georgia must immediately start allowing poll managers to clear voters who show proof of citizenship. Ross also ordered Kemp to issue a news release explaining how flagged potential voters could vote by proving their citizenship, and offer a phone number for people to call with any questions. In a statement to NPR, Candice Broce, the spokeswoman for Secretary of State Kemp's office, said Ross's decision is \"a minor change to the current system.\" Kristen Clarke, president and executive director of the Lawyers' Committee for Civil Rights Under Law, one of the groups that brought the lawsuit, called the decision \"scathing.\" \"Prior to the court's issuance of relief, these citizens, many of whom provided proof of citizenship with their registration form, would have had to physically track down a Deputy Registrar in the county to provide proof of their citizenship,\" said Clarke. \"Tracking this one individual down was a fatal requirement that would have been impossible for many to meet.\" A report by The Associated Press said that under the \"exact match\" law, Kemp had stalled more than 50,000 voter registrations by mostly black voters. The AP  also reported that through a process Kemp calls \"voter roll maintenance,\" his office has \"cancelled over 1.4 million voter registrations since 2012\" and that \"nearly 670,000 registrations were cancelled in 2017 alone.\" Voting rights been a central issue in Kemp's race against Democrat Stacey Abrams, who is vying to become the nation's first black female governor. The race has attracted national attention, even drawing a visit on Friday by Oprah Winfrey, who spoke at an Abrams rally about the state's history of voter suppression, and implored people to show up at the polls. \"For anybody here who has an ancestor who didn't have the right to vote and you are choosing not to vote wherever you are in this state, in this country, you are dishonoring your family,\" Winfrey said. \"You are disrespecting and disregarding their legacy, their suffering and their dreams when you don't vote.\" Wow, wow, wow. This may be the single most powerful story I've ever heard.Vote. If not for yourself, do it because people like Otis Moss Sr. couldn't. pic.twitter.com/0vaCqEF4vt President Trump is scheduled to appear in the state on Sunday at a rally for Kemp. In a gubernatorial debate last month, Kemp said allegations he had been attempting to suppress the vote are \"totally untrue.\" \"I've staked the integrity of my whole career on the duty that I have as secretary of state. I have always fulfilled and followed the laws of our state and I'll continue to do that,\" Kemp said. Abrams has based a large part of her strategy around turning out minority voters. On Saturday in an interview with MSNBC, Abrams said, \"The fundamental belief that I have for my campaign and this state, is it's an organizing opportunity. It is not just about my election. It is about building the capacity for voters who are often overlooked by our politics to have their voices heard.\" On Friday, in a separate case, the American Civil Liberties Union announced the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 11th Circuit had denied Kemp's request to block a court order requiring him to exercise due process before rejecting ballots over mismatching signatures and handwriting. The state attorney general's office has not responded to a request from NPR for comment on the ruling. The debate over voter suppression in the midterm elections extends to multiple  states. In North Dakota the Republican-controlled government has implemented a controversial new law requiring residents to show identification with a current street address. But as Ruben Kimmelman reported for NPR, \"Many residents of Native American reservations \u2014 who tend to vote for Democrats \u2014 do not have street addresses. They have Post Office box numbers, and those don't qualify.\" In Iowa, the Republican secretary of state is phasing in a new voter ID law, and in Dodge City, Kan., a federal judge has denied a request to reopen the city's longtime polling site in the city. The location of the new polling site is outside the city limits, and more than a mile away from the nearest bus stop, making travel there difficult for some potential voters. The debate over voting rights extends back decades to before the 1965 Voting Rights Act, which sought to make voting easier for millions of minority voters across the country. In a 2013 ruling, Shelby County v. Holder, the Supreme Court struck down a key provision of the Voting Rights Act, which stipulated that states like Georgia, with a history of racial discrimination, had to get changes to voting measures approved in advance by the federal government. With that oversight abolished, multiple states have moved to implement new voting measures, such as the \"exact match\" law, which Georgia legislators enacted last year.",

He is asking GOP gubernatorial candidate Brian Kemp to step down from his position as Georgia secretary of state \"to ensure the confidence of our citizens.\"\n                \n                    \n                    Scott Cunningham/Getty Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption Former President Jimmy Carter has devoted much of his post-presidential life to observing elections overseas. He is asking GOP gubernatorial candidate Brian Kemp to step down from his position as Georgia secretary of state \"to ensure the confidence of our citizens.\" Updated at 4:09 p.m. ET Former President Jimmy Carter has personally urged the Republican candidate for governor in Georgia to resign from his position overseeing the state's elections. Carter lodged his appeal to Georgia Secretary of State Brian Kemp in a letter dated last Monday and first obtained by The Associated Press. The contents of the letter were confirmed to NPR by a spokesperson for the Carter Center, the former president's organization devoted partly to monitoring democratic elections across the world. In his letter to Kemp, Carter said it was his decades of experience assisting elections abroad that persuaded him to wade into the bitter dispute now roiling the Georgia gubernatorial race. Kemp has been under fire for deciding to purge tens of thousands of voters from the voter rolls \u2014 months after declaring his intent to run for governor. \"In Georgia's upcoming gubernatorial election, popular confidence is threatened not only by the undeniable racial discrimination of the past and the serious questions that the federal courts have raised about the security of Georgia's voting machines, but also because you are now overseeing the election in which you are a candidate,\" wrote Carter, who served as Democratic governor of Georgia himself before winning the presidency in 1976. \"This runs counter to the most fundamental principle of democratic elections \u2014 that the electoral process be managed by an independent and impartial election authority.\" Carter is far from the only prominent figure to raise concerns about Kemp's role as both candidate and referee in next week's election \u2014 and last year's voter purge is not the only move that has gotten Kemp embroiled in controversy. An APM Reports investigation found that removals have spiked during Kemp's tenure overseeing Georgia's election process. More than 1.6 million names were removed from the state's rolls in the past decade, including his eight years in office. And a half-dozen civil rights groups recently sued the secretary of state over the delay of some 53,000 voter registration applications, which his office has placed on hold citing questions about the applicants' citizenship status. According to the AP, nearly 70 percent of those pending registrations came from African-Americans. Kemp's Democratic opponent, Stacey Abrams, is seeking to become the first black female governor in U.S. history. \"This protocol will continue to have a discriminatory impact on African-American, Latino and Asian-American applicants,\" the groups alleged in their complaint, \"and will continue to impose severe burdens on voting-eligible Georgians' fundamental right to vote that are not justified by any rational or compelling state interest.\" Kemp, for his part, has denied wrongdoing, and he has dismissed previous calls for him to step down as secretary of state. He says his office's actions are squarely in line with a state protocol known as \"exact match,\" which requires that information supplied on voter registration forms line up precisely with the applicant's Social Security and driving records. Errors such as misspellings or the use of nicknames can result in delayed processing under the law passed last year. A Kemp spokesman responded to Carter's letter Monday by blaming Abrams for \"trying to distract voters with another publicity stunt.\" \"It's sad that she's using the former president to do her dirty work,\" campaign Communications Director Ryan Mahoney said in a statement. Secretary of State Brian Kemp declares victory in July after winning a runoff to win the GOP nomination for governor.\n                \n                    \n                    Jessica McGowan/Getty Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption Secretary of State Brian Kemp declares victory in July after winning a runoff to win the GOP nomination for governor. A federal district judge held an emergency hearing on the matter Monday. \"The civil rights groups suing want the judge to order more election workers eligible to check those documents so things run smoother,\" Johnny Kauffman of Atlanta member station WABE explains. Carter didn't get too deep into specifics in his brief personal appeal to Kemp. Rather, the former president laid out his argument as a broad plea to ensure the stability of Georgia's electoral process. \"In order to foster voter confidence in the upcoming election, which will be especially important if the race ends up very close, I urge you to step aside and hand over to a neutral authority the responsibility of overseeing the governor's election,\" Carter said. \"This would not address every concern, but it would be a sign that you recognize the importance of this key democratic principle and want to ensure the confidence of our citizens in the outcome.\"",

A potential trial over a new 2020 census citizenship question is set to start on Nov. 5 in New York City. The first potential trial of the six lawsuits over the hotly contested 2020 census citizenship question could kick off the day before voters head to the polls for the upcoming midterm elections. During a court hearing at Manhattan federal court on Friday, U.S. District Judge Jesse Furman set the tentative start date for Nov. 5, adding that his \"strong instinct\" is that the two cases before him require a courtroom trial before he can issue a ruling. Potential trials for the two cases in California and one of the Maryland cases are set to start in January. Rulings by the district court judges are expected to be appealed to higher courts. That could extend this legal battle into the final months of preparations for the 2020 census. New York and more than two dozen states and cities, plus other groups, are suing the Census Bureau and the Commerce Department, which oversees the bureau, over Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross' decision in March to add a question about U.S. citizenship status to forms for the upcoming national headcount. The controversial question Ross has said he approved adding the question \u2014 which asks, \"Is this person a citizen of the United States?\" \u2014 so that the Justice Department can use the responses to better enforce the Voting Rights Act's Section 2 provisions against discrimination of racial and language minorities. The federal government has relied on estimates of voting-age citizens from a sample survey now known as the American Community Survey to enforce that civil rights law since it was enacted in 1965. The Census Bureau's chief scientist and other researchers have warned against adding the citizenship question to the census. They cite research that suggests asking about citizenship status in the current political climate of anti-immigrant rhetoric and increased immigration enforcement under the Trump administration could discourage noncitizens from participating in the census. Findings from focus groups conducted for the 2020 census marketing campaign by the advertising agency Young & Rubicam indicate the question could complicate the Census Bureau's outreach to certain groups. A slide for an internal bureau presentation that was released Thursday with one of the plaintiffs' court filings noted: \"A number of focus group participants responded negatively to adding the citizenship question, most notably Spanish (U.S. mainland) as well as Vietnamese, Chinese, [Native Hawaiian and Other Pacific Islander], and members of the female [Middle Eastern or North African] group.\" NEW: @uscensusbureau\u2019s #2020census focus group participants for marketing campaign by @YoungRubicam \u201cresponded negatively to adding the citizenship question, most notably Spanish (U.S. mainland) as well as Vietnamese, Chinese, NHPI, & members of the female MENA group\u201d\ud83d\udc47 pic.twitter.com/HxEnnUBZEZ The Constitution requires the government to conduct a once-in-a-decade head count of every person living in country \u2014 regardless of citizenship status \u2014 in order to produce population numbers used to redistribute congressional seats and Electoral College votes among the states. The plaintiffs want the question about citizenship status \u2014 which has not been among the census questions for all U.S. households since 1950 \u2014 removed to avoid a potential undercount of people living in households with noncitizens, including unauthorized immigrants. That would affect how an estimated $800 billion a year in federal funds are distributed based on population counts. Skipping a trial? During Friday's hearing, Justice Department attorney Kate Bailey said the Trump administration does not want to go to trial because it believes the administration has already disclosed \"more than ample information\" for Judge Furman to issue a ruling. Over the past three months, the Trump administration has released thousands of pages of internal emails, memos and other documents to explain Ross' decision to add the question. Officials from the Census Bureau and the Commerce Department have also faced hours of questioning by the plaintiffs' attorneys. Elena Goldstein, an attorney from the New York state attorney general's office, pushed back during Friday's hearing, calling a trial the \"most efficient and logical way to go\" given the differences between the plaintiffs' and the Trump administration's stances on the citizenship question's impact and why Ross added it to the 2020 census. Judge Furman said he was \"skeptical\" of skipping a trial to go to summary judgment, but he is open to reviewing the Trump administration's argument to do so. The release of more documents The hearing did not resolve whether two key Trump administration officials involved with the citizenship question will be deposed for the lawsuits. The 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals is reviewing the administration's request to block the deposition of John Gore, the acting head of the Justice Department's civil rights division. That division allegedly needs the citizenship question responses for Voting Rights Act enforcement. Justice Department attorneys say they're prepared to ask the higher court to block a deposition of Ross, which the plaintiffs have asked Furman to allow. On Friday, Furman did rule that the Trump administration must release unredacted versions of previously-released internal documents that, he said, \"go to the heart\" of why Ross decided to add the citizenship question. Those documents are due to the plaintiffs by Monday.",

Florida bars citizens with felony convictions from voting, unless they receive an exemption from the state's clemency board, led by the governor. Jagada Chambers was sent to prison for attempted second-degree murder in 2000. The story, as he tells it, was that he was on spring break with friends during college and got into a physical altercation with an acquaintance. He was released four years later, in August 2004, and his understanding was that his voting rights were gone forever. This all happened in Florida, which permanently bars citizens with felony convictions from voting, unless they receive an individual exemption after a hearing from the state's clemency board, led by the governor. \"I committed my crime in Florida, so I thought I had been disenfranchised forever,\" said Chambers. An estimated 10 percent of adults in Florida cannot vote because of a felony record, according to a 2016 report from The Sentencing Project. But Chambers was never a Floridian, and so those strict rules didn't apply to him; Chambers was just confused by the system. \"I was free over a decade not knowing that I was able to vote,\" said Chambers. Chambers, now 42 and living in Nevada, voted for the first time in 2016. \"It's a design ... to prevent people of color from voting,\" said Chambers, who now works on voting rights with other previously incarcerated people in Las Vegas. Research has shown that racial disparities in sentencing disproportionately affect African-Americans. In the midst of legal proceedings over the system earlier this year, Florida Gov. Rick Scott's spokesman John Tubbs defended the practice. \"The Governor believes that convicted felons should show that they can lead a life free of crime and be accountable to their victims and our communities,\" he said in a statement. As Chambers' story shows, barriers to voting can have an impact beyond what the law says and does. Making it harder to vote Many people say they don't vote because they're inconvenienced or they're discouraged; laws and rules can contribute to that. In 2016, four percent of registered voters did not vote because of \"registration problems,\" according to a Pew Research Center analysis of Census Bureau data. Another three percent pointed to \"transportation problems,\" and two percent cited \"inconvenient hours or polling places.\" Research has shown that one factor consistently linked with higher vote turnout is the ability to fix a registration issue at the time of voting. One of these registration problems is tied to an upsurge in voter purging. Across the country, the rate at which people are being purged from the voting rolls has increased substantially compared to a decade ago, according to a report from the Brennan Center published this summer. The analysis found about four million more people were purged between 2014 and 2016 than in the equivalent period between 2006 and 2008. \"We also found that there was a particular increase in areas that used to be covered by the Voting Rights Act Section 5,\" said Jonathan Brater, counsel with the Brennan Center's democracy program and co-author of the report. In 2013, the Supreme Court struck down the requirement in Section 5 of the Voting Rights Act that some southern states and other jurisdictions around the country with a history of racial discrimination seek federal approval before implementing changes to their election rules and procedures. One of those states was Georgia. \"Georgia has had a number of problematic and controversial voter registration and purging practices over the last few years,\" said Brater. Georgia had a law that rejected voter registration forms if certain information on the form, such as the hyphen in a person's last name, didn't precisely match the spelling in other state databases. It also currently has a program that removes registered voters from the rolls if they haven't voted in the past four federal elections and have not responded to a letter in the mail.

In 2015, ahead of a competitive local election, the voting eligibility of approximately 17 percent of registered voters in Sparta was challenged. Showing up to vote is not a good measure of eligibility, Brater said, \"For the simple fact that many people skip elections.\" But the Supreme Court recently upheld a similar policy in Ohio. Had that decision been in place on Election Day 2016, an estimated 7,500 who voted would not have been eligible to vote, according to a Supreme Court brief filed by Demos and the ACLU, as well as an admission by the Ohio secretary of state. Many experts say voter purges are necessary to ensure accurate voting records and remove people who've died or moved. Brater agrees, but he worries they have further consequences: \"Voter purges can have the effect of making it more difficult for people who are not necessarily the most regular voters.\" Merritt Hubert knows this firsthand. The thirty two-year-old was kicked off the voting rolls in 2015. He was accused of not living at the address on file. But Hubert gestured to the yellow mobile home behind him, off a dusty, rural side road in a tiny Georgia town about 100 miles east of Atlanta, and said he's lived here the whole time. In fact, Hubert said the letter accusing him of not living here was mailed to this address. \"Basically, they just wanted to scratch our names off the list, period, that we don't live in Hancock County,\" he said, referring to the county Board of Elections.

Supporters say it prevents voter fraud. In 2015, ahead of a competitive local election, this system was used en masse in Hancock County to challenge the voting eligibility of approximately 17 percent of all registered voters in Sparta, Ga., most of whom were black. Roughly three-quarters of the county's population is black. \"Basically I think it's a racism thing,\" said Hubert. \"They want(ed) whites to run the town.\" But Nancy Stephens, a member of the Board of Elections, strongly disagreed race had anything to do with the case, and says the accusations of discrimination have been \"blown out of proportion.\" She insists she was trying to clean up a system that had been neglected for years. \"Our electors list was not current \u2014 people that should have been removed, deceased people, people that were not living in the county [were still on the list],\" she said. \"The list had not been cleaned up for quite some time.\" Stephens, who wanted to be clear she was speaking to NPR as an individual and not on behalf of the board as a whole, insisted she was trying to make the elections more \"legal\" and \"honest.\" \"We followed Georgia state law,\" she said. \"The citizens that brought the challenges ... they had talked to neighbors, and they were told that the people didn't live where they were saying they live.\" But Hubert and another Hancock County man whose name was removed from the voter rolls, Johnny Thornton, both feel they were accused by hearsay, and they think the goal was voter suppression. They joined others in filing a lawsuit against the Board of Elections. In a settlement, the board denied its motive was racial discrimination. Still, the board agreed to change how it reviews challenges, the county remains under the oversight of a judge, and most people's names, including Hubert's, were added back to the voting rolls. Brater with the Brennan Center said that often doesn't fix the problem. \"When people have bad experiences with the voting system, a lot of people react to that by saying, 'Well forget about it, I'm not going to do this again,'\" he said. \"It has discouraged a lot of people from voting,\" said Hubert. \"But not me.\" He says he's now more determined to vote.",

Kyrsten Sinema, D-Ariz., speaks onstage at The Human Rights Campaign 2018 Los Angeles Gala Dinner at JW Marriott Los Angeles earlier this year. She's running this year for Senate, aiming to be just the second LGBTQ person elected to that body. Democrats have a lot of diverse candidates running this year \u2014 a record number of women, African Americans and Native Americans running in high-profile races that they hope could lead them to a blue wave. But there's also been a surge of lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender candidates all across the country who want to give that blue wave a rainbow tinge. \"I think candidates are running because they see it's possible. They see the need for more LGBTQ candidates to get involved in the process. But they now see clear evidence that we can win at the very highest levels of government,\" said Victory Fund President Annise Parker, whose group endorses viable LGBTQ candidates. Parker was the first openly LGBTQ mayor of a major U.S. city when Houston voters elected her in 2009. Loading... According to their data, 430 openly LGBTQ candidates this year have run for office at every level of government. Many say they've been pushed off the sidelines, fearing their rights are under attack. Three years after the Supreme Court legalized gay marriage, they now see the Trump administration working to bar transgender people from serving in the military and promoting religious freedom laws the LGBTQ community says would legalize discrimination. Currently, there are only six out LGBTQ House members and only one lesbian senator, Wisconsin's Tammy Baldwin who's running for re-election. Baldwin could be joined by Arizona Rep. Kyrsten Sinema, who's bisexual and just won the Democratic nomination for Senate in one of the most competitive races this year. There will be at least 22 LGBTQ candidates on the ballot for House seats this fall \u2014 several in highly competitive districts that will determine control of the House. Among the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee's \"Red To Blue\" candidates \u2014 those with the best shot of flipping a GOP-controlled House seat \u2014 there are five LGBTQ candidates who have a viable shot of being elected in November. And with half of the current LGBTQ lawmakers in the House running for higher office, these candidates could replenish or add to their ranks. Loading... One of those candidates is Angie Craig, running in Minnesota's 2nd District in the suburbs of the Twin Cities against GOP Rep. Jason Lewis, who she lost narrowly to in 2016. If elected, Craig would be the first LGBTQ mom ever to serve in Congress, and her campaign ads feature her wife, Cheryl, and their four sons. \"I'm not running because I would be the first lesbian mom, but that's pretty cool I would be,\" Craig told NPR in an interview. Craig's journey to become a mom is part of what drove her to run for office. When she and her then-partner were living in Tennessee and decided to adopt a baby, she was caught in a three year legal battle after the birth mother's parents sued to challenge their fitness to raise a child. Today, her son Josh is 20. \"It probably is the thing that has shaped my life the most,\" Craig said. \"When you get up every single day for news and you don't know whether you're going to be able to put your son to bed that night. Certainly it makes you unafraid of anything and I think, you know I when I'm running for Congress I always remember no matter how tough it gets it'll never be anything more difficult than what I faced back in Tennessee.\" That theme of struggle is something other LGBTQ candidates have cited as reasons why they're running this year. Christine Hallquist made history when she won the Democratic gubernatorial nomination in Vermont. She's the first transgender person ever to win a major party's nomination for governor. Hallquist is one of four LGBT Democratic nominees for governor running this cycle \u2014 in fact, they represent every part of that acronym. Lupe Valdez in Texas is lesbian, Rep. Jared Polis in Colorado is gay and incumbent Oregon Governor Kate Brown \u2014 the first openly LBGTQ person ever to win a governor's race \u2014 is bisexual. In an interview with Morning Edition after her victory, Hallquist recalled how difficult her transition had already been \u2014 harder than anything she might face in the campaign or if she is elected governor. \"I dealt with not being authentic my whole life,\" she told NPR's David Greene. \"And now that I'm through it and looking back, you know, it's a joy to be where I am today. But it's really hard for folks. And transitioning was clearly the hardest thing that I could ever imagine doing.\" Other candidates, like Rufus Gifford, who is running on Tuesday in a crowded Democratic primary for an open seat in Massachusetts's 3rd District, talk about the discrimination he faced after coming out as gay. Gifford served as U.S. ambassador to Denmark under President Obama, but the 2016 election aftermath spurred him to put his own name on the ballot. He remembers watching other people run for office when he was a teenager, but there weren't role models for him as he was struggling with his sexuality, something he talks candidly about in a TV ad. \"I hope that sometimes, just by being open and smiling and talking about my life now, that 15-year old version of me may just have a glimmer of hope,\" Gifford told NPR. \"I just think that that's incredibly impactful and matters. I know it would have mattered to me. I would have loved to have seen that. They could have changed my life in a lot of ways.\"",

Juan \"Chuy\" Hinojosa looks at redistricting maps on display in the Texas Senate in 2013 in Austin, Texas. On Monday, the Supreme Court overruled a decision that several of the state's districts had been drawn to minimize minorities' voting power. A bitterly divided Supreme Court on Monday upheld the redrawing of congressional and state legislative maps in Texas. The decision reversed earlier court findings that intentional racial discrimination had infected the way that some statehouse and congressional districts were drawn \u2014 and came five years to the day after the high court struck down a key provision of the Voting Rights Act. \"Our legislative maps are legal\" The Texas decision comes in a case that has lasted so long and is so complicated that even election experts find it daunting to discuss. The case has pinged and ponged between two separate three-judge federal courts and the U.S. Supreme Court. The bottom line, though, is that even though the lower court in Texas ruled that districts in and around the state's biggest cities had been drawn to minimize minority voting power, the Supreme Court only agreed with the lower court about one state legislative district, in Fort Worth. As the state's Republican Gov. Greg Abbott gleefully tweeted Monday, \"Our legislative maps are legal. Democrats lost their redistricting & Voter ID claims.\" Contrary to Democrats repeated claims to contrary the Supreme Court rules Texas lawmakers did not intentionally discriminate in drawing political maps. Our legislative maps are legal. Democrats lost their redistricting & Voter ID claims. #txlege #tcot https://t.co/1HoeCmHpe9 A thumb on the scale If the ruling were just about Texas, it would be important, but not huge. The 5-4 decision, however, could have major repercussions. Five years ago, when the court struck down a key provision of the 1965 Voting Rights Act by a similar 5-4 split, Chief Justice John Roberts downplayed the effects of the decision. Back then, he noted that there were many other provisions of the law that gave minority voters the right to sue if their voting rights were minimized. But election expert Rick Hasen of University of California Irvine says those promises ring hollow after Monday's decision. \"The court today seems to minimize the chances that these remedies are going to be effective in future cases,\" he said. Calling the decision \"bold\" and \"audacious,\" Hasen says that it will undoubtedly enable more suppression of minority votes. And he says the language of the decision would seem to make it far more difficult to punish a recalcitrant state by putting it back under federal supervision for the next decade \u2014 a Voting Rights Act provision the Supreme Court left intact five years ago. \"This decision is going to make it very, very difficult to put any state back under federal preclearance ... by setting a standard that puts the thumb on the scale that favors states, by saying you have to presume the good faith of the legislature,\" Hasen added. Loyola professor Justin Levitt agreed, saying \"What any other state can take from today's decision is, 'If I intend to discriminate, a court may nip and tuck a bit, but they're not going to undo what I've done wholesale.' \" Charged language The decision, written by Justice Samuel Alito, overruled the lower court's findings that all of the districts in question were drawn to suppress the minority vote. Alito said the lower court used the wrong standard in evaluating the districts \u2014 that it should have presumed the state acted in good faith, rather than assuming that the new district lines were an extension of previous racial gerrymandering. Justices Clarence Thomas and Neil Gorsuch concurred in the decision. Expressing what Hasen called a radical position, they asserted that the Voting Rights Act does not apply to redistricting at all. Justice Sonia Sotomayor wrote a 46-page dissent lambasting the majority on behalf of the court's four liberals. The majority's \"disregard for both precedent and fact comes at serious costs to our democracy,\" she said. \"It means that after years of litigation and undeniable proof of intentional discrimination, minority voters in Texas ... will continue to be underrepresented in the political process.\" Even though minorities now constitute a majority of the Texas population, she said, minority voters will cast their ballots this year, and in 2020, knowing that their \"vote has been burdened by the manipulation of district lines specifically designed to target their communities and minimize their political will.\" NYU law professor Richard Pildes noted that Monday's opinions were in stark contrast to others this term. \"The tone in most of the opinions, dissents and majorities, is on the whole very tempered this term,\" he said, but the language in both the ruling and dissent on Monday was \"much edgier.\" The influence of past discrimination Pildes and Levitt also suggested that the forgiving standard adopted by the conservative court majority is a bad indicator for those challenging the Trump travel ban. As Pildes put it, one of the key questions of the travel ban case is whether past statements made by President Trump, which earlier courts have found to be discriminatory, \"carry over in some significant way to reviewing the legality of the order that's now before the court.\" \"The issue at the heart of both [the] redistricting case and the travel ban case is the lingering impact of prior discrimination on something you do a few months later,\" Levitt said. \"And the court clearly was pretty hostile to drawing continuing implications about the motives of a state government entity based on what it had done a short time earlier. And I think that is a foreboding omen for the travel ban case.\"",

            "article_content": "The Supreme Court justices seemed frustrated by the problem of partisan gerrymandering in arguments Wednesday \u2014 and what to do about it.  AILSA CHANG, HOST: Frustration seemed to reign at the Supreme Court today. Justices heard arguments in a second case about extreme partisan gerrymandering. The first case, argued last fall, challenged a Republican gerrymander of the Wisconsin state legislature. It was so partisan the GOP captured nearly two-thirds of the seats even when they lost the statewide vote. AUDIE CORNISH, HOST: Today's case involves a Democratic gerrymander in Maryland. It redrew congressional district lines with the avowed purpose of flipping a traditionally Republican district into Democratic hands. NPR legal affairs correspondent Nina Totenberg reports. NINA TOTENBERG, BYLINE: On the steps of the Supreme Court, lawyer Michael Kimberly, representing Republican voters from Maryland's 6th Congressional District, said people on the street understand what partisan gerrymandering is all about. MICHAEL KIMBERLY: It's about rigging elections. It is fundamentally counter-Democratic. TOTENBERG: Inside, the justices certainly grasped the problem of modern gerrymandering and how it's grown exponentially because of sophisticated data collection and advanced computer technology. But the court seemed frustrated when it came to figuring out what, if anything, the court should do about it. Justice Stephen Breyer put it this way - it seems like a pretty clear violation of the Constitution to have deliberate extreme gerrymandering, but is there a practical remedy that won't get judges involved in dozens and dozens and dozens of very important political decisions? Breyer noted that the court has before it the Maryland and Wisconsin cases and a case in the wings from North Carolina. Each is based on a different legal theory, so Breyer suggested that perhaps the court should have all three cases reargued next term to try to make sense of them all together. But none of the other justices picked up that suggestion. The Republican challenge to the Maryland redistricting is based on the idea that a person's vote is the ultimate form of political expression and that the Maryland gerrymander thus violates the First Amendment guarantee of free speech. But pressed by the justices, Kimberly was willing to embrace the arguments in other cases, namely that extreme partisan gerrymandering violates the voters' rights to equal protection of the law. Maryland solicitor general Stephen Sullivan had the unhappy task of defending a gerrymander that both liberal and conservative justices viewed as extreme. Justice Sonia Sotomayor, an Obama appointee, noted that the Democratic governor of the state said he felt duty bound to ensure that his party won in this district for the decade. Justice Elena Kagan, also an Obama appointee, said however much you think is too much partisanship, this case is too much. Only 10,000 people had to be removed from the district to comply with one person, one vote. But what the Maryland legislature did, she said, was to shovel 360,000 people out of the district and bring 350,000 in. The result being that the district went from 47 percent Republican and 36 percent Democratic to exactly the opposite. Chief Justice John Roberts, a George W. Bush appointee, said the district has no internal logic. You have people from suburban Potomac ten miles from Washington, D.C., join with people from the rural far west panhandle. The problem is greater than one district in Maryland, chimed in Breyer, observing that no redistrictor would ever be so stupid as to duplicate the Maryland facts after today's argument. The problem, he reminded his colleagues, is a national one. We can't just say forget it. And if you think what's happened now is something, wait until you see those computers really working in 2020. The difference between the court's conservative and liberal justices, however, seemed to be their willingness to actually deal with what all agree is a problem. Justices Ginsburg, Kagan and Sotomayor all observed that the court has established standards for dealing with racial gerrymandering, so why not extreme partisan gerrymandering? Sotomayor - are we just saying it's too complicated? Chief Justice Roberts - one difference is that we've always recognized that a certain degree of partisanship is acceptable. We've never accepted that a certain degree of racial discrimination is acceptable. With the court apparently split, it would appear that, as is frequently the case, Justice Anthony Kennedy holds the decisive fifth vote. Today, he gave only the barest hint that he might side with the court's liberals - nothing worth placing a bet on. Nina Totenberg, NPR News, Washington. Copyright \u00a9 2018 NPR.

            "article_content": "Loading... Updated at 5:30 p.m. ET The Supreme Court justices seemed to grasp the problem of gerrymandering in oral arguments on Wednesday and that it will only get worse, as computer-assisted redistricting gets even more refined. But they appeared frustrated over what to do about it \u2014 without becoming the constant police officer on the beat. This case, involving a Democratic-drawn congressional district in Maryland, is essentially Act II of the gerrymandering play at the Supreme Court. Act I opened the first week in October when the nine justices heard arguments in a case testing whether there is any constitutional limit to partisan gerrymandering \u2014 the practice of drawing legislative district lines to maximize and perpetuate the power of the incumbent party. At issue in the case is the Republican gerrymander of the Wisconsin Legislature \u2014 a design that delivered nearly two-thirds of the districts to the GOP even as Republicans lost the statewide vote. In the Maryland case argued Wednesday, Michael Kimberly, the attorney for the Republican plaintiffs, contended that the map drawers succeeded in \"rigging\" an election, and the average American voter understands what's going on. He dubbed it an affront to democracy. That's the kind of argument that Democrats have made about lots of other states throughout the country, where Democrats are underrepresented in both state legislatures and the U.S. House or Representatives. \"Max-Democratic\" The Supreme Court has ruled that racial gerrymandering is illegal, but has recognized that a degree of partisan gerrymandering will take place and is OK. The question is how much. Several justices echoed concerns about how much partisan gerrymandering is taking place and how much worse it will get because of technology in 2021 when the districts will be redrawn after the 2020 Census. Justice Stephen Breyer all but threw up his hands out of frustration. \"So what do we do? Just say good-bye? Forget it?\" he asked. \"The people who do the gerrymandering are not stupid,\" Justice Breyer warned. \"Wait until you've seen those computers really working\" after the next census. Many of the justices' questions hinged on the issue of timing. Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg wondered if it wasn't \"much too late\" for the Republican challengers, even if they were successful, \"for there to be any change for the 2018 election.\" Chief Justice John Roberts derided them for waiting too long. \"If you've been willing to accept that harm in three different cycles, I don't know if we should get concerned about irreparable harm for one more,\" he said. But as Justice Breyer pointed out, this is a \"problem of serious dimensions that is national.\" \"However much you think is too much [partisanship], this case is too much,\" said Obama appointee Elena Kagan. She noted that in Maryland, Democrats only needed to move 10,000 people into the district to comply with one person-one vote, but instead they shuffled 360,000 people out and brought 350,000 people in. The result was that the district went from 47% Republican and 36% Democratic to exactly the opposite. Justice Sonia Sotomayor, also an Obama appointee, noted that the Democratic governor at the time of the redistricting said he felt \"duty bound\" to ensure that his party won the district for the rest of the decade, until the next census. Chief Justice John Roberts, appointed by George W. Bush, said this district geographically didn't make much sense, that it had \"no internal logic.\" It stretches from the Washington suburbs to the more rural, \"far west panhandle.\" He joked that both areas had farms, but one had \"hobby farms\" while the other had \"real\" ones. Some of the justices compared partisan gerrymandering with racial gerrymandering. Justice Ginsburg noted, \"There was a period when 'max-black' was the effort. And it seems to me that what we have here is 'max-Democratic.' And if 'max-black' was no good, why should 'max-Democratic' be OK?\" Maryland Solicitor General Steven M. Sullivan responded that racial gerrymandering draws \"from a history of exclusion of African Americans from our political process, something that Republicans can hardly claim, certainly not today\" when they control both the White House and Congress. But Chief Justice Roberts opined that \"one difference is that we've always recognized that a certain degree of partisanship is acceptable,\" while \"we've never accepted that a certain degree of racial discrimination is acceptable.\" Why the second case? Just why the court added the Maryland case to its docket long after the Wisconsin case was argued last fall is unclear. Speculation has centered on two theories \u2014 one legal and one political. The political explanation was spurred by a comment from Chief Justice Roberts during the Wisconsin arguments. \"If you're the intelligent man on the street and the court issues a decision\" and the Democrats win, he speculated, \"the intelligent man on the street is going to say, 'It must be because the Supreme Court preferred the Democrats over the Republicans.' ... And that is going to cause very serious harm to the status and integrity of the decisions of this Court in the eyes of the country.\" Now, as it happens, while the Wisconsin case involves a redistricting that strongly favors the Republicans (although only at the state legislative district level), the Maryland redistricting under scrutiny Wednesday favors the Democrats. The Democratic leadership in the state drew the congressional district lines to make it more difficult for the GOP to prevail in one of the two traditionally Republican congressional districts in the state. The result is that today just one of Maryland's eight members of Congress is a Republican. The bottom line is it could be that optics are part of the reason the court added a second partisan gerrymandering case to its docket, so that in one case the Republicans could prevail, and in the other, the Democrats could. Equal protection or free speech? There are other differences between the two cases. The Maryland challengers object to only one district's design, while the Wisconsin challengers object to the whole state's redistricting. That said, drawing new lines for one district, would, of necessity, have ripple effects, changing the lines in others. Another difference is the major legal argument. The Wisconsin challengers argue that extreme gerrymandering deprived Democratic Party voters of the equal protection of the law guaranteed by the Constitution, while the Maryland challengers contend that the gerrymander there deprives Republicans of their First Amendment rights by making their speech, their votes, less valuable. But each of these arguments feeds into the other. And statistical analyses suggest that each argument, if adopted, would produce pretty much the same results. The First Amendment argument, however, appeals, in particular, to the justice whose vote is likely to decide the case, Justice Anthony Kennedy. In 2004, he provided the fifth vote for the court staying out of partisan gerrymandering cases, but he made it clear that he remained open to finding a way to measure what is unconstitutional gerrymandering based on party and he specifically mentioned the First Amendment notion that government action cannot punish people based on partisan affiliation. At Wednesday's argument, he gave only the barest hint that he might side with the court's liberals. Nothing worth putting a bet on. Still, as election expert Rick Hasen, of the University of California, Irvine, observes, Kennedy, 81, knows he will not be on the court forever. \"It's put-up-or-shut-up time,\" Hasen said. \"Either he's going to say, 'We've got to start policing this' or he has to recognize that what is going to happen in the next round in 2020 is going to look a lot worse than in this round, that it's going to be no-holds-barred, squeeze out whatever you can, in favor of your party and against the other party.\" Act III of this drama? Well, that is likely to come in June when the Supreme Court finishes writing it.",

Albert Mohler, Jr. speaks at the school's convocation ceremony in 2013. Mohler, who has led the seminary for 25 years, commissioned a report on the role racism and support for slavery played in its origin and growth. The Southern Baptist Convention, the largest Protestant denomination in the United States, came into being in 1845 as the church of Southern slaveholders. Now, 173 years later, Southern Baptist leaders are not just acknowledging their dark history; they are documenting it, as if by telling the story in wrenching detail, they may finally be freed of its taint. The Southern Baptist Theological Seminary, the denomination's flagship institution, this week released a 71-page report on the role that racism and support for slavery played in its origin and growth. \"The founding fathers of this school \u2014 all four of them \u2014 were deeply involved in slavery and deeply complicit in the defense of slavery,\" writes school President R. Albert Mohler Jr., in a letter accompanying the report. \"Many of their successors on this faculty, throughout the period of Reconstruction and well into the 20th century, advocated the inferiority of African-Americans and openly embraced the ideology of the Lost Cause of southern slavery.\" Mohler, who has led the seminary since 1993, commissioned the history report, which was compiled by a committee of six current and former seminary faculty members, and he promised from the outset that it would be released to the public without editing. We knew, and we could not fail to know, that slavery and deep racism were in the story. R. Albert Mohler, Jr. \"We have been guilty of a sinful absence of historical curiosity,\" Mohler, 59, wrote in the introductory letter. \"We knew, and we could not fail to know, that slavery and deep racism were in the story. We comforted ourselves that we could know this, but since these events were so far behind us, we could move on without awkward and embarrassing investigations and conversations.\" That story is now told, in a way only Southern Baptists themselves could tell it. The report draws heavily on seminary archives, including correspondence among the four founders. Among them, they held more than 50 enslaved persons. The report acknowledges that the only reason a separate Southern Baptist denomination was formed was because northern Baptists refused to appoint slaveholders as missionaries. \"The seminary's early faculty and trustees defended the righteousness of slaveholding,\" the report says, \"and opposed efforts to limit the institution.\" Some of them argued that slavery was in the best interests of the slaves themselves, while others insisted it was \"a God-ordained institution.\" The seminary leaders opposed Abraham Lincoln's election and argued vigorously on the eve of the Civil War in favor of secession, seeing it \"as the only hope for preserving slavery.\" During the postwar Reconstruction period, the seminary leaders opposed political representation for African-Americans and explicitly advocated white supremacy. For much of the 20th century, seminary leaders defended racial segregation and refused to admit black students. Seminary classrooms were not integrated until 1951. \"It's a very difficult story,\" Mohler told NPR. \"But it needed to be told. It needed to be documented, and it needed to be done now.\" The Southern Baptist Convention formally apologized to African-Americans in 1995 for the denomination's pro-slavery past, and in 2017, the convention adopted a resolution condemning white supremacy. The seminary's report nevertheless breaks new ground. The \"history\" section of the current SBTS website does not disclose that its founders were slave owners and ardent defenders of the institution of slavery. \"One of the first things that will happen is that our institutional history will be revised,\" Mohler said. What that might entail is not yet clear. There are no statues of the founders on the campus to remove, according to Mohler, although the seminary's undergraduate college is named after James P. Boyce, one of the four founders, and some buildings and student associations carry the names of other pro-slavery seminary leaders. \"Taking the names off in a sense is just an effort to hide,\" Mohler said. \"This is our story. This is exactly who we are. Our responsibility is to serve God faithfully, both in what we retain and in what we reject from those who came before us.\" The seminary today admits black students, and some Southern Baptist congregations are led by African-American ministers. The denomination these days is distinguished from other Baptist groupings by its heightened evangelical identity and by the theological and political conservatism of many of its leaders. Notwithstanding the seminary's new openness about its pro-slavery past, the detailed chronology ends in 1964. \"In the decades following the civil rights movement, the seminary continued to struggle with the legacy of slavery and racism,\" the report concludes, but without further elaboration. \"Making a statement about Confederate monuments might be a next step,\" says Alison Greene, a historian of U.S. religion at Emory University in Atlanta, \"or taking a stand on questions of voting rights in the 21st century. That would be really significant.\" Greene, who was raised as a Southern Baptist, found the seminary report lacking in its failure to acknowledge any consequence of the denomination's recent association with conservative politicians and the policies they have promoted. \"It papers over a generation of hand-in-glove cooperation with efforts to roll back every single social program that served African-Americans or promised to rectify, even in the smallest ways, the gross economic and social effects of enslavement and segregation and inequality on black communities,\" Greene says.",

The Supreme Court has temporarily shielded Ross from having to sit for questioning under oath for the 2020 census citizenship question lawsuits. Updated 6:25 p.m. ET Friday The Supreme Court has temporarily shielded Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross from having to sit for questioning under oath in the lawsuits over a controversial citizenship question the Trump administration added to the 2020 census. In a separate concurring opinion for Justice Clarence Thomas and himself, Justice Neal Gorsuch described a lower court's order allowing \"a trial to probe the Secretary's mental processes\" as \"highly unusual, to say the least.\" Released on Monday, the court's order allows the administration to file additional requests for the high court to permanently block Ross' deposition. In a written statement, Kelly Laco, a spokeswoman for the Justice Department, called the order \"a win for protecting the rights of the Executive Branch.\" The agency is representing the Trump administration in these lawsuits. \"The intrusive and improper discovery in this case disrupts the orderly functioning of our government and is, as Justices Gorsuch and Thomas noted, 'highly unusual,' \" she wrote. \"The Department of Justice is committed to protecting the rule of law and looks forward to further proceedings before the Supreme Court.\" The administration's request to temporarily block other lower court orders for the lawsuits, however, were not successful. The Supreme Court is allowing the plaintiffs' attorneys to question Justice Department official John Gore, who leads the department's civil rights division. The administration argues that division needs the citizenship question to better enforce the Voting Right Act. Document requests from the plaintiffs can also move forward as the start date for the first potential trial over the citizenship question draws closer. In a written statement, Amy Spitalnick \u2014 a spokesperson for the New York state attorney general's office, representing the plaintiffs in one of the lead lawsuits \u2014 said the plaintiffs, \"welcome the Court's decision to allow us to complete discovery in the case, with the exception only of Sec. Ross' deposition.\" \"We'll get to the bottom of how the decision to demand citizenship status was made, as we continue our case to ensure a full and fair Census,\" Spitalnick wrote in an email. New York is among the dozens of states, cities and other groups that are suing to get the question Ross approved for the upcoming national head count removed. The question asks, \"Is this person a citizen of the United States?\" The plaintiffs' attorneys are trying to prove that Ross misused his authority over the census by adding the hotly contested question. In his opinion from September that accompanied the lower court order allowing the questioning of Ross under oath, U.S. District Judge Jesse Furman wrote: \"Secretary Ross must sit for a deposition because, among other things, his intent and credibility are directly at issue in these cases.\" Gorsuch, however, wrote in his separate opinion that the plaintiffs have not presented enough evidence of \"bad faith\" from Ross to justify an inquiry into his motives. \"There's nothing unusual about a new cabinet secretary coming to office inclined to favor a different policy direction, soliciting support from other agencies to bolster his views, disagreeing with staff, or cutting through red tape,\" Gorsuch wrote. He also indicated that the high court is \"likely\" to grant any additional requests from the administration for the court to permanently block Ross' deposition and other discovery requests that go beyond the record of emails, memos and other internal documents about the citizenship question that the administration has already released. This latest development, after weeks of legal back-and-forth over the depositions of Ross and Gore, puts pressure on the plaintiffs' attorneys preparing for the first potential trial over the citizenship question. That trial is expected to start on Nov. 5 in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York. The deadline for evidence gathering for the two lead lawsuits in New York passed earlier this month. Gorsuch noted in his opinion that the trial in New York may have to be postponed if the Trump administration asks the Supreme Court to hear the case. On Tuesday, the administration asked Furman to pause preparations for the trial until the Supreme Court resolves the petition the administration is planning to submit. Furman issued an order Friday denying that request, noting that delaying the start of the trial, \"could make a timely final decision next to impossible.\" Furman also pushed back against Gorsuch's and Thomas' conclusion that the plaintiffs have not made a sufficient case that Ross is acting in \"bad faith.\" \"The Court found reason to believe that Secretary Ross had provided false explanations of his reasons for, and the genesis of, the citizenship question \u2014 in both his decision memorandum and in testimony under oath before Congress,\" Furman wrote. In anticipation of Furman's ruling, the administration's attorneys filed a similar request on Thursday with the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals to delay the trial. A three-judge panel of the appeals court denied that request on Friday. The administration argues the Justice Department's civil rights division, currently led by Gore, needs the question on citizenship in the census in order to better enforce the Voting Rights Act protections against racial discrimination. Census Bureau research, however, suggests using the census to ask every U.S. household about citizenship status in the current political climate could discourage noncitizens, including immigrants living in the U.S. illegally, from taking part in the head count. The Constitution requires the federal government to count every person living in the U.S. \u2014 regardless of citizenship status \u2014 once a decade. Those numbers determine how many congressional seats and Electoral College votes are distributed among the states after the census. An undercount of households with noncitizens could shift political power, as well as portions of an estimated $800 billion a year in federal funds, away from states and local communities with high noncitizen populations and toward those with smaller ones.",

            "article_content": "You're reading NPR's weekly roundup of education news. New school shooting database shows 2018 spike A new database released this week finds that 2018 was a record year for school violence. The researchers cross-referenced more than 1,300 incident reports from 25 different sources going back nearly 50 years. This K-12 school shooting database tried to capture each and every instance a gun was brandished or a bullet was fired on school property. So what were the results? In 2018 there were 82 documented incidents and 51 documented deaths. The next highest number of deaths occurred in 1993, with 40, and after that in 2012 with 37 deaths. One thing to note: there are no clear trends in the database. While 2018 shows a spike, 2011, for example, was near an all-time low. Hurricane Michael keeps student out of school As NPR has reported, schools in some parts of North Carolina have been closed for five weeks due to hurricane-related flooding damage. Parts of the state still haven't recovered from Hurricane Florence, which hit a month ago. Teachers now worry that, with Hurricane Michael, students are not getting the meals, and the emotional support, that many may depend on. Hurricane Michael also closed dozens of school districts in Florida as well as several university campuses. Harvard lawsuit heads to trial A federal lawsuit alleging racial discrimination in Harvard's admissions practices heads to trial on Monday. The suit was brought by Students for Fair Admissions, which has accused Harvard of using \"racial balancing,\" and treating Asian-American applicants unfairly by systematically rating them lower on intangible traits, like courage, kindness and leadership. The group is led by conservative legal strategist Edward Blum, who filed a similar lawsuit for a white student at the University of Texas. The U.S. Justice Department has also backed the suit. Education and the November election The midterm elections are just under a month away, and a new report by the Center for American Progress finds that ballot measures in 15 states (if they are passed) could add almost $2 billion to public education. The center argues that \"public education has suffered a punishing decade\" and \"most states have been slow to return to pre-recession investment levels.\" Nonprofits sign letter attacking \"online preK\" A coalition of advocacy groups issued a letter on Wednesday urging states not to put public money toward so-called \"online preschool\" software products created by companies like K12 Inc. and Chalk. As the letter notes, the state of Utah, \"citing the need to serve families in rural areas cheaply, sponsored the first state-funded online program of this kind, called UPSTART, and thousands of families have enrolled.\" UPSTART has also expanded pilot programs to at least seven other states. The organization, Waterford, reports academic gains for students who use the software. But critics \u2014 like those at Defending the Early Years, and Campaign for a Commercial Free Childhood\u2014 say young children don't learn best in front of a computer. High-quality preschool programs, they say, include a low student-teacher ratio, hands-on play and physical activity.",

Updated 10:33 p.m. ET Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg has temporarily blocked lower court orders for depositions by two senior Trump administration officials in the multiple lawsuits over the new question about U.S. citizenship status on the 2020 census. The ruling comes after U.S. Solicitor General Noel Francisco filed a request Tuesday night for the high court to permanently block the court-ordered depositions by Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross and Justice Department official John Gore, as well as requests for internal documents. After the lawsuits' plaintiffs file a reply to the administration's request by 4 p.m. ET Thursday, Justice Ginsburg can either make a ruling herself or refer the request to the full Supreme Court. The Trump administration's request to the high court comes amid a last-minute scramble by its attorneys to stop Ross and Gore from having to sit for questioning under oath in the two lead lawsuits in New York. Evidence gathering for the two lawsuits is set to end this week. All of this legal back-and-forth is building up to the start of the first potential trial over the citizenship question, which is set to begin on Nov. 5, the day before the midterm elections, at the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York. Lawyers for the dozens of states, cities and organizations suing the Trump administration were set to question Gore on Wednesday and Ross on Thursday. Ross approved adding the citizenship question to the census as the head of the Commerce Department, which oversees the Census Bureau. Gore leads the Justice Department's Civil Rights Division that, the administration argues, needs responses to the citizenship question to better enforce the Voting Rights Act's protections against discrimination of racial and language minorities. Earlier on Tuesday, a three-judge panel of the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals rejected the Trump administration's effort to stop Ross' deposition, which the judges kept temporarily on hold to allow either the administration or the lawsuits' plaintiffs \"to seek relief from the Supreme Court,\" according to their order. The 2nd Circuit order on Tuesday upholds an earlier ruling by U.S. District Judge Jesse Furman, who wrote: \"Secretary Ross must sit for a deposition because, among other things, his intent and credibility are directly at issue in these cases.\" The administration's attorneys, however, argue that Furman should base his ruling on the cases on the internal documents the administration has already released as part of the lawsuits. Last week, Ginsburg turned down the administration's previous request for the high court to temporarily stop the depositions and document requests for the lawsuits but left the door open for the administration to ask the court to permanently block them. Ross has said he added the question so that the Justice Department can use the citizenship information to better enforce Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act. But the plaintiffs say the federal government does not need the 2020 census to collect citizenship data to enforce Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act. Since the law was enacted in 1965, the government has relied on estimates of voting-age citizens from a Census Bureau survey now known as the American Community Survey. More than two dozen states and cities, plus other groups, have filed suit to get the citizenship question removed from forms for the upcoming national head count. Citing Census Bureau research, they worry that asking about citizenship status in the current political climate will discourage households with noncitizens from participating in the census. That, in turn, would harm the accuracy of the information collected for the constitutionally mandated head count of every person living in the U.S. In their complaints, the plaintiffs say that Ross' decision to add the question was a misuse of his discretion over the census as the head of the Commerce Department. They also allege that the Trump administration's push for the question discriminated against immigrant communities of color. A question about citizenship status has not been included among the census questions for all households since 1950. Democrats in both the Senate and House of Representatives have been calling for Ross to return to Capitol Hill to testify about the citizenship question after internal memos and emails released as part of the lawsuits contradicted a timeline Ross described in past testimony. Before announcing the addition of the citizenship question in March, Ross told lawmakers that the Justice Department \"initiated\" the request for the question. Asked whether the White House directed him to add a citizenship question, Ross said during a House hearing, \"We are responding solely to the Department of Justice's request.\" In June, however, Ross disclosed in a memo filed as part of the lawsuits that he began considering adding the question to the 2020 census \"soon after\" he took over the Commerce Department in February 2017; the Justice Department sent its formal request to the Census Bureau later that year, in December. Ross also noted that \"other senior Administration officials had previously raised\" the issue of a citizenship question.",

Ron Johnson, R-Wisc., as he prepares to testify during his confirmation hearing before the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee on Wednesday in Washington, D.C. Updated 7:04 p.m. ET President Trump's nominee for the Census Bureau's next director, Steven Dillingham, took one step closer to filling a key leadership post for the 2020 census that's been empty for more than a year. Members of the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee questioned Dillingham Wednesday during his confirmation hearing on Capitol Hill. It's not clear when the committee members will vote on whether to send his nomination to the full Senate for confirmation. But the committee's chair, Sen. Ron Johnson, R-Wisc., said he wants to move it along \"as quickly as possible.\" If confirmed for a term lasting through 2021, Dillingham would lead the federal government's largest statistical agency as it embarks on the first U.S. census to be conducted mainly online. As its director, he would also join multiple lawsuits against the Census Bureau over a newly added citizenship question that could disrupt the final months of preparation for the constitutionally-mandated head count of every person living in the country. In the meantime, without permanent leadership, the bureau has been ramping up preparations for the 2020 census, set to kick off in rural Alaska in January of that year. After John Thompson stepped down in an earlier-than-expected retirement last June, the bureau has been led by Acting Director Ron Jarmin, a career staffer who previously led the Census Bureau's economic programs. \"No plans to voice an opinion\" While the senators' questions touched on reducing the cost of the census, cybersecurity risks, and the challenge of hiring enough census workers, a topic lawmakers returned to repeatedly during Wednesday's hearing was the hotly contested citizenship question. Dillingham avoided taking a position on the question that asks, \"Is this person a citizen of the United States?\" Asked by Sen. Steve Daines, R-Mont., if he supports including the citizenship question on the census, Dillingham replied: \"I have no plans to voice an opinion on that question. I think it would not be advisable in my position if I'm confirmed to be the director of the Census Bureau.\" The courts, he added, will decide whether or not the bureau will continue its plans to include the question on forms for the upcoming national head count. \"It will be my responsibility, if confirmed, to administer the decennial census in accordance and consistent with that judicial decision,\" Dillingham testified. As the next Census Bureau director, Dillingham would step into six lawsuits over Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross' decision to add the controversial question about U.S. citizenship status to the 2020 census. Ross has said he approved adding the question because the Justice Department needs the responses to better enforce the Voting Rights Act's protections for racial and language minorities against discrimination. The Census Bureau's chief scientist and other researchers, however, urged Ross to rely instead on existing government records about citizenship status to meet the Justice Department's needs. They also warned Ross that using the census to ask about citizenship status could discourage households with noncitizens, including immigrants living in the U.S. illegally, from participating in the head count. That, in turn, could harm the accuracy of the information collected from the census. The population count is used to determine how many congressional seats and Electoral College votes each state receives after the census, not to mention its portion of an estimated $800 billion a year in federal funding for schools, roads and other public institutions and services. \"Chilling effect\" Shortly after the White House announced Dillingham as the nominee in July, Rep. Carolyn Maloney, D-N.Y., who serves on the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, expressed concerns about his past experience as an adviser to the American Legislative Exchange Council, or ALEC, a conservative group that tries to shape state laws. \"Dr. Dillingham needs to reject the [Trump administration's] attempt to add a citizenship question,\" Maloney said in a written statement. \"If he does not, I believe the Senate should reject his nomination.\" While he did not speak out against the question during Wednesday's hearing, Dillingham did acknowledge that the Census Bureau's \"best and brightest ... identified the possibility that there could be changes\" in people's responses to the census because of the newly added citizenship question. Replying to concerns about a \"chilling effect\" raised by Sen. Maggie Hassan, D-N.H., Dillingham noted the bureau's plans to follow up with households that don't respond to the census immediately on their own. He also emphasized the need to counter any negative perceptions about any of the 2020 census questions with the bureau's planned advertising campaign. Sen. Kamala Harris, D-C.A., pushed Dillingham on whether he was concerned that the bureau has not conducted testing on a questionnaire for the 2020 census that includes the citizenship question. After expressing concern about the impact of all the 2020 census questions, he ultimately replied, \"If confirmed, I would certainly confer with the experts at the Census Bureau ... and determine their best views on that topic.\" \"Valuable experience\" Dillingham, who has a Ph.D in political science from the University of South Carolina, has been nominated for the bureau's top job without any prior experience working at the agency. But he did lead smaller federal statistical agencies during both Bush administrations, with stints at the Bureau of Justice Statistics and the Bureau of Transportation Statistics, which he left during the Obama administration. Under President Trump, he has led the Peace Corps Office of Strategic Information, Research, and Planning. Dillingham declined NPR's interview requests. Katherine Wallman, a former chief statistician at the White House's Office of Management and Budget, worked with Dillingham during his time at the Bureau of Transportation Statistics. She says his past service as a political appointee in prior administrations who reported to policy officials could help him as the head of the Census Bureau, which is overseen by the Commerce Department. \"I think that's very valuable experience to know how to work in that environment,\" Wallman says.",

The Revolutionary Power of Women's Anger by Rebecca Traister Hardcover, 284 pages | Your purchase helps support NPR programming. How? For author and New York magazine writer Rebecca Traister, Thursday's contentious hearing highlighted important differences in the way Kavanaugh and Christine Blasey Ford, who testified to the allegations, told their stories. Traister says Ford's polite and constrained demeanor was in stark contrast to Kavanaugh's use of a full range of expression. \"He had in his arsenal the ability to use anger, fury, tears in a way that he felt confident would resonate with the American people. I don't think that Dr. Christine Blasey Ford \u2014 I can't imagine a scenario in which she would have gone into that hearing room armed with that same weapon, that same tool; that she could yell and be furious in her retelling of what happened to her,\" Traister tells NPR's Rachel Martin. Traister's new book, Good and Mad: The Revolutionary Power of Women's Anger, is a deeper exploration of that dynamic. She says the idea for the book came to her just before the 2017 Women's March. She describes a buildup of anger \u2014 her own anger, the anger of other women that spilled over from the 2016 election of President Trump, and anger at many of the white women who voted for Trump in that election \u2014 as a catalyst for her book. Though the Women's March had a massive turnout and has been followed by \"a year that has women protesters opposing the health care repeal, teacher strikes, women running for office in historic numbers, and then #MeToo,\" Traister says the potency of women's anger and activism is still routinely diminished. In an interview with Morning Edition, she discusses why she chose to examine women's anger and how it has been both politically transformative and perilous for women throughout U.S. history. On why women's anger has been historically perceived as threatening Well, in part, that anger of the founding \u2014 our founders who were the white men chafing against their lack of representation and who were angry and protested in ways that we understand correctly to this is our revolutionary moment. But when they made their new nation, they codified some of the very inequities that they themselves were angry about with regard to the British government. So they built the nation on slavery and the disenfranchisement of women. On the silencing of women of color in the #MeToo movement I think it's almost impossible for us to conceive of the voices of women of color as being heard loudly enough because they have been so unheard and so marginalized for so long. In fact, it's women of color who have been the leaders and the leading thinkers of so many of our social movements, in ways that have remained invisible to us. So when we think about #MeToo, one of the things that gets lost is that the definition of sexual harassment stems from cases that were brought in the '70s by women of color. ... In 1991, it was Anita Hill, whose testimony against Clarence Thomas, claiming that he sexually harassed her, sort of cemented the idea that sexual harassment wasn't individual behavior but damage done to a class. It's Tarana Burke, who in 2006 pioneers and leads the #MeToo movement. And then when the #MeToo movement erupts \u2014 I think it's really important that we understand that the first people to get attention were very wealthy white actresses. ... I don't say that to diminish the experience or the reality of the harm they sustained. But in fact, all of that is foregrounded by women of color whose stories so often get lost or kind of erased. On why the power of women's anger is not limited to a progressive partisan agenda My argument is not that women's anger is always righteous. It's that it's very often politically potent and yet we're told not to take it seriously, still. I think that it's the anger that women are feeling across the country that is having a catalytic connective impact. And this is part of a long process \u2014 social movements take a long time. The kind of anger that women are feeling in this moment around Kavanaugh is going to be part of a far longer story that's going to extend deep into our future.

Updated at 7:50 p.m. ET Justice Anthony Kennedy announced Wednesday he would be retiring from the Supreme Court. With him go his three decades of experience on the bench and, more politically pressing, his moderate legal philosophy. It was this centrist streak that made his vote the key in many deeply divisive cases \u2014 so many, in fact, that Kennedy earned himself a reputation as the court's quintessential \"swing vote.\" Kennedy himself was no fan of the term. \"The cases swing,\" he once said. \"I don't.\" But when the high court's conservative and liberal blocs appeared at a stalemate \u2014 a fairly frequent occurrence in recent years \u2014 it would be no surprise to find his name in the slim majority when the ruling was released. On the occasion of his retirement, it's worth a look back on some landmark 5-4 rulings that were likely decided by a single vote \u2014 his. One need not look far. Janus v. AFSCME (2018) On Wednesday, the day of Kennedy's retirement, the Supreme Court ruled 5-4 for a child-support specialist who challenged an Illinois law requiring government workers to pay partial union dues, even if they're not members, to cover the cost of negotiations on their behalf. Mark Janus argued he should not be responsible for any collective bargaining fees if he has opted out of the union \u2014 and the high court's majority, including Kennedy and the conservative justices, agreed. The ruling dealt a significant defeat to public employee unions, which have had a pillar of their financial support knocked out from under them. Perhaps nowhere is it expected to have a greater impact than among teachers unions, which, as NPR's Cory Turner and Anya Kamenetz report, stand to lose members, money and influence in debates over education reform, among other things. Read the full opinion Trump v. Hawaii (2018) Just one day earlier Kennedy joined the court's conservative justices in a decision on the Trump administration's travel ban, which bars visitors from eight countries, six of which have Muslim majorities. The ban had undergone several revisions since its chaotic introduction just days into Trump's presidency, but each one had been rejected by lower courts as either illegal or unconstitutional. The high court disagreed with those rulings, finding that the proclamation falls \"squarely within the scope of Presidential authority.\" President Trump celebrated the ruling as a \"profound vindication\" of his immigration policies, which have drawn significant backlash for years, dating back to the first moments of his presidential campaign. It is also likely to have an outsize impact on the office of the presidency itself, having affirmed the chief executive's broad powers to dictate immigration policy as a response to changing conditions abroad. Read the full opinion and dissents Obergefell v. Hodges (2015) In the case that effectively legalized same-sex marriage nationwide, Kennedy cast his pivotal swing vote with the liberal bloc and wrote the majority opinion. \"It would misunderstand these men and women to say they disrespect the idea of marriage. Their plea is that they do respect it, respect it so deeply that they seek to find its fulfillment for themselves,\" he wrote. \"Their hope is not to be condemned to live in loneliness, excluded from one of civilization's oldest institutions. They ask for equal dignity in the eyes of the law. The Constitution grants them that right.\" Reporting at the time, NPR's Nina Totenberg was not shy in assessing the case's importance. \"This is probably right up there with Brown v. Board of Education and Roe v. Wade \u2014 if you like it or hate it \u2014 and today, Obergefell v. Hodges,\" she said. \"This was a historic moment.\" Read the full opinion Shelby County v. Holder (2013) The Voting Rights Act of 1965 went under the microscope in Shelby County, which saw the Alabama county challenging a key provision of the law. The portion in question required certain areas with records of racial discrimination \u2014 Alabama among them \u2014 to get approval from the federal government before making any changes to their elections procedures. But Kennedy sided with the court's conservatives, finding that the provision leveled unfair and outdated burdens on the affected states. \"Our country has changed,\" Chief Justice John Roberts wrote in the majority, \"and while any racial discrimination in voting is too much, Congress must ensure that the legislation it passes to remedy that problem speaks to current conditions.\" The ruling struck down the key section and stripped the Justice Department of some tools to monitor elections. And several states have since moved to implement stricter voting laws, including requiring voters to show ID and redistricting maps without federal approval first. Both developments have fueled new controversy in the courts. Read the full opinion United States v. Windsor (2013) Two years before Obergefell, Kennedy joined liberal justices in Windsor and wrote the majority opinion to strike down the 1996 Defense of Marriage Act. The law defined marriage as \"a legal union between one man and one woman as husband and wife\" and in so doing barred same-sex spouses from receiving federal recognition in matters of tax filing and insurance benefits, among other things. According to Kennedy's opinion, issued in June 2013, it also denied same-sex couples their Fifth Amendment right to \"equal liberty.\" Read the full opinion Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission (2010) Kennedy joined conservatives in the majority to hold that corporate donations to political campaigns are protected by the First Amendment. \"If the First Amendment has any force,\" Kennedy said in the opinion he wrote for the majority, \"it prohibits Congress from fining or jailing citizens, or associations of citizens, for simply engaging in political speech.\" The decision radically changed decades of campaign finance law by striking down limits on corporate and union political spending. And it changed the face of politics itself. Read the full opinion District of Columbia v. Heller (2008) In this landmark Supreme Court case addressing the Second Amendment, decided precisely a decade ago Tuesday, Kennedy joined the conservatives. The court sided with Dick Anthony Heller, a special police officer who challenged a D.C. regulation that kept him from having a handgun at home. Defying a precedent set nearly seven decades earlier, the justices in the majority defined the amendment as saying individuals \u2014 and not just groups \u2014 enjoy the right to bear arms. But there were limitations on that right, the court noted. Kennedy was the deciding vote, \"and it has long been assumed that the caveats in the decision were the price of his vote,\" Totenberg wrote earlier this year. Read the full opinion Roper v. Simmons (2005) This 5-4 ruling found that executing juvenile offenders constitutes \"cruel and unusual punishment\" and thus violates the Eighth Amendment. \"When a juvenile offender commits a heinous crime, the State can exact forfeiture of some of the most basic liberties,\" Kennedy wrote in the majority opinion, \"but the State cannot extinguish his life and his potential to attain a mature understanding of his own humanity.\" Unlike most cases on this list, it featured no clear ideological split, with the liberal-leaning Sandra Day O'Connor joining her conservative colleagues in dissent. Read the full opinion Planned Parenthood of Southeastern Pennsylvania v. Casey (1992) The ruling in Casey upheld Roe v. Wade. In an unusual move, the majority opinion was written by not one but three justices, including Kennedy. It introduced the \"undue burden\" test, which asserted that a state cannot make laws that impose a \"substantial obstacle in the path of a woman seeking an abortion before the fetus attains viability.\" The test has become a key factor in cases addressing abortion in the years since \u2014 including in Whole Woman's Health v. Hellerstedt, another closely argued decision released nearly a decade and a half later. In that 5-3 decision \u2014 delivered by a shorthanded court just months after Justice Antonin Scalia's death in 2016 \u2014 justices in the majority relied on the undue burden test to strike down a Texas law limiting abortion availability.

            "article_content": "Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross, who oversees the Census Bureau, appears before the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform to discuss the 2020 census, in Washington, D.C., in October 2017.\n                \n                    \n                    J. Scott Applewhite/AP\n                    \n                \nhide caption Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross, who oversees the Census Bureau, appears before the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform to discuss the 2020 census, in Washington, D.C., in October 2017. Updated on June 15 Why did Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross, who oversees the census, approve adding a hotly contested citizenship question to 2020 census forms? Ross has said the driving force is the need for more accurate citizenship data, which he wants to collect during the next once-a-decade head count of every person in the country as required by the U.S. Constitution. The question was requested this past December by the Justice Department, which says it needs data from the census to better enforce the Voting Rights Act's provisions against racial discrimination. Since the law was enacted in 1965, the federal government has relied on estimates of the citizen population based on Census Bureau surveys involving a sample of U.S. households. But critics of the new citizenship question \u2014 including more than two dozen states and cities who are taking the Trump administration to court to remove it \u2014 say they are skeptical of the Justice Department's reasoning. They're concerned that a question about citizenship status \u2014 a topic that the Census Bureau has not included in the census for all households since 1950 \u2014 will discourage noncitizens from participating in the census, especially given the increased immigration enforcement and rise of anti-immigrant rhetoric under President Trump. BREAKING: @TheJusticeDept has released 1,320 pages of emails, memos, other docs on hotly contested #2020census citizenship question from @uscensusbureau & @CommerceGov for lawsuit led by @NewYorkStateAG \u2014 and my editor @LuisClemens & I read them: https://t.co/auAUq8jpCg On June 8, the Commerce Department released 1,320 pages of internal memos, emails and other documents related to Ross's decision as part of the lawsuits against the citizenship question. They provide some new insight into the behind-the-scenes discussions leading up to the commerce secretary's controversial announcement in March \u2014 one that could have ripple effects on the 2020 census results that will be used to reallocate congressional seats, draw legislative districts and distribute an estimated $800 billion a year in federal funds. Census Bureau officials warned about a \"very costly\" citizenship question In a Jan. 19 internal memo prepared for Ross, the Census Bureau's chief scientist, John Abowd, wrote that adding a citizenship question to the 2020 census \"is very costly, harms the quality of the census count, and would use substantially less accurate citizenship status data than are available\" from existing government records at other federal agencies. Ross has said that he believes the cost of this last-minute change to the 2020 census would not be significant and has been factored into updated cost estimates. Still, Abowd projected that it would raise the price tag for the national head count by at least $27.5 million, which he described as a \"conservative estimate\" given the possible need for more door-knocking and other follow-up efforts to get noncitizen households to take part in the census. \"At the direction of Steve Bannon,\" Kris Kobach spoke with Ross about a citizenship question In a July 2017 email to Ross's chief of staff, Wendy Teramoto, Kansas Secretary of State Kris Kobach says Steve Bannon \u2014 the former White House strategist \u2014 directed Kobach to speak on the phone with Ross in 2017 during the early months of the Trump administration about the then lack of a citizenship question on the census. Kobach had once helped lead Trump's now-dissolved voter fraud commission. Neither Kobach nor Bannon have responded to NPR's requests for comment about this email. A Commerce Department spokesperson would not provide any details about the phone call between Kobach and Ross. \"The Kobach email is one out of over 500 pages of stakeholder records produced in the administrative record,\" the spokesperson wrote in an email. \"The notion that Secretary Ross decided to reinstate the citizenship question in response to a single email is clearly disproved by the robust administrative record.\" Still, after this communication was revealed, attorneys for plaintiffs in some of the citizenship question lawsuits filed a motion in San Francisco federal court to request that Kobach and Bannon testify out of court. Kobach told Ross including \"aliens\" in census numbers for congressional reapportionment is a \"problem\" In another July 2017 email, Kobach wrote to Ross that he was concerned that \"aliens who do not actually 'reside' in the United States are still counted\" in census numbers used to determine how many congressional seats each state gets. Noncitizens have been included in past population counts used for reapportioning seats in the House of Representatives among states ever since the first census in 1790. Later in his email, Kobach proposed wording for a census citizenship question that would ask noncitizens about their immigration status. The Census Bureau is trying to get access to citizenship information from other federal agencies Before Ross decided to add a citizenship question to the 2020 census, the Census Bureau's acting director, Ron Jarmin, and other officials tried to convince him to meet the Justice Department's needs by using existing government records about U.S. citizens. Ross ultimately decided to allow the bureau to request access to federal data sets to supplement the 2020 census responses to the new citizenship question. A draft internal Census Bureau document shows that the statistical agency has been working to get access to naturalization data from U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, visa and passport data from the State Department, and records from the Social Security Administration. A spokesperson for the Commerce Department, which oversees the Census Bureau, says the information detailed in the document is up-to-date. A spokesperson for the Social Security Administration, Darren Lutz, confirmed that the agency is \"currently working with the Census Bureau to renew\" a data-sharing agreement that expires at the end of September. Spokespeople for USCIS and the State Department said they could not address NPR's questions about the bureau's data requests by publication time.",

Democrats may hold 49 votes in the Senate but for all practical purposes, they have been completely disarmed when it comes to opposing President Trump's judicial nominees. Now Republican leaders, worried about possibly losing control of the Senate in the November elections, are racing against the clock to push through as many judicial nominations as they can. But even some of their own members are privately worried that abandoning longtime practices and understandings is undermining the Senate's constitutional power to provide its advice and consent on judicial nominations. For most of former President Obama's time in office, the filibuster still existed for judicial nominations, and Republicans used the threat or actuality of the filibuster aggressively to slow down or block Obama's nominations. By late 2013, Democrats were so frustrated that they abolished the filibuster for all judicial nominations except the Supreme Court. Republicans, however, found other ways to block and stall the Democratic president's choices \u2014 through other rules and longtime unwritten understandings that the GOP is no longer honoring now that one of their own is president. For McConnell, judicial confirmations are priority No. 1 Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., has made no secret of what he considers his greatest achievement: refusing to even consider Obama's nomination of Judge Merrick Garland to the Supreme Court for nearly a year, and the subsequent confirmation of Trump nominee Neil Gorsuch within the first six months of the new administration. That, of course, included abolishing the filibuster for Supreme Court nominations too. Since then, it's been on to the federal lower courts, where McConnell has made judicial confirmations a number one priority. Tuesday, he ebulliently bragged to reporters that one-eighth of the federal appeals court seats are now occupied by Trump appointees. The mood was quite different in the Senate Judiciary Committee two days later when senators met to vote on six judicial nominations, three of them very controversial. The date was May 17, the 64th anniversary of the Supreme Court's Brown v. Board of Education decision, which declared racial segregation of public schools unconstitutional. On this particular day, it rankled Democrats more than usual that two of the nominees before the Judiciary Committee, following the Trump administration playbook, had refused to say whether the Brown case was correctly decided. That is a marked departure from nominees in previous Republican administrations. Trump nominees, however, have been coached not to respond to questions about their personal beliefs, about concepts of law and about any specific Supreme Court decisions, no matter how historic. \"Good lord,\" exploded Sen. Patrick Leahy, D-Vt. \"I'll be darned if I'm going to have someone stand up and say 'I can't tell you if I agree with a Supreme Court decision which is the law of the land.\" In a scathing tone, Leahy asked, \"Is there anybody in this room who wants to repeal Brown v. the Board of Education?\" Sen. John Cornyn, R-Texas, objected, noting that all the nominees had said they would follow existing Supreme Court precedents. And Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, added that if a nominee were to answer one such question, that would create a \"slippery slope,\" leading to more questions about other decisions. A GOP senator's warning But Sen. John Kennedy, R-La., who has made no secret of his growing anger over the stonewalling by Trump judicial nominees, wasn't buying it. \"I do worry,\" he said, that \"our nominees are so well coached and for whatever reasons are so timid, that they won't discuss the law.\" And he had a warning for the Trump administration, declaring, \"I'm not going to vote for nominees anymore that won't answer my questions.\" Democrats have complained with increasing fervor about Republicans making it difficult to question nominees by lumping so many of them together in each hearing. They've complained about nominees with strong ideological activist backgrounds on such issues as abortion refusing even to discuss what criteria they would use in deciding whether to recuse themselves from cases. They've complained about the GOP's latest move: refusing to honor the tradition of not moving forward with nominees when both senators from a state object to the nomination. They've complained about changed FBI background check procedures. And they've complained about what they see as an overall ramming through of large numbers of nominees, without giving senators enough time to examine the nominees' records. Indeed, in the first year of the Trump administration, Republicans managed to win confirmation for 12 appeals court nominees, compared to three in the first year of the Obama and Clinton administrations, five in the George H.W. Bush administration, and six in the George W. Bush administration, according to a recent report by the Congressional Research Service. There are, of course, Republican explanations for these disparities \u2014 for instance, that President Trump has been more aggressive and prolific than past presidents in making judicial nominations. In the process, the administration has forwarded nominees to the Senate with relatively little substantive vetting. \"Those of us on our side have had enough\" But the biggest difference between the Trump nominations and those of previous presidents is that McConnell has made this his number one priority, while in the Obama administration, McConnell, even when in the minority, used every tactic at his command to slow down the confirmation process \u2014 tactics that he frequently refuses to allow Democrats to use since Trump took office. This week the ranking Democrat on the Senate Judiciary Committee, California's Dianne Feinstein, who until now has often seemed resigned to losing, threw down a marker at Thursday's hearing where the committee ultimately did not vote on any of the nominees. \"Those of us on our side have had enough,\" she said. \"And we're going to begin to be much more active than we have been\" about \"this effort to stack the circuit courts of the United States.\" Just how the Democrats will do that is unclear, but not without some Republicans breaking ranks \u2014 something that has not happened under McConnell's reign as Senate majority leader. At least not yet.",

Updated 4:20 p.m. ET, May 18 The acting head of the Justice Department's civil rights division, John Gore, dodged questions from lawmakers Friday about why the department requested a controversial citizenship question to be added to 2020 census forms. Testifying in front of the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee, Gore said he would not comment beyond publicly available information, citing the Justice Department's role in representing the Trump administration in ongoing lawsuits against the question. The division he leads at the department is charged with enforcing the Voting Rights Act \u2014 the law that the DOJ says is driving its push for the citizenship question. \"You can't answer a question as to whether you talked to your boss, who we pay?\" asked Rep. Elijah Cummings of Maryland, the top Democrat on the committee, when Gore avoided responding directly about what he and U.S. Attorney General Jeff Sessions have discussed about the department's request. During the hearing, Democratic Rep. Carolyn Maloney of New York called for the committee's chairman, Trey Gowdy, a South Carolina Republican, to issue a subpoena to force Gore to answer the committee's questions.

(right) and Ranking Member Elijah Cummings, D-Md., prepare for a hearing on May 8. Lawmakers were planning to issue a separate subpoena for Gore, who was a no-show after receiving an invitation to appear at the committee's May 8 hearing about the upcoming national head count. At this earlier hearing, lawmakers did hear testimony from the Census Bureau's acting director, Ron Jarmin, plus a former DOJ official under President Barack Obama and representatives from the Government Accountability Office and Commerce Department, which oversees the census. On Friday, Gore started his testimony by explaining that he did not attend the May 8 hearing so that he would not appear alongside a non-governmental expert witness testifying on a topic that's the subject of ongoing litigation. Still, he was admonished by committee members, including Rep. Darrell Issa, a Republican from California who suggested that Gore could have requested a separate hearing earlier. \"It is not for the Department of Justice to simply say, 'We're not showing up if we don't get what we want,' \" Issa said. In December, the DOJ submitted a last-minute request for the citizenship question to Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross, who approved the request in March. The DOJ says it needs a better count of voting-age citizens to enforce the Voting Rights Act's protections against discrimination of racial and language minorities. Since the law was enacted in 1965, the government has relied on estimates of U.S. citizens based on a smaller Census Bureau survey currently known as the American Community Survey. But the DOJ says it now requires citizenship data collected from every U.S. household through the census. More than two dozen states and cities are suing the Trump administration to remove the citizenship question from the 2020 census form. They cite research by the Census Bureau that suggests asking about citizenship could discourage noncitizens, especially unauthorized immigrants, from participating in the census. The U.S. Constitution requires a head count of every person living in the country, regardless of citizenship or immigration status. That census information is used for reapportioning congressional seats, drawing legislative districts and distributing an estimated $800 billion a year in federal funds. Whether the citizenship question stays on the 2020 census forms is likely to be determined by the courts or Congress. Some Democrats are working on bills that would remove the question, but their passage likely hinges on whether Democrats win majorities after the midterm elections in November. In preparation for the recent House hearings, Democrats on the oversight committee have been trying to obtain internal documents from the Census Bureau and Commerce Department. NPR has filed a Freedom of Information Act request for those same documents. During the May 8 hearing, Jarmin said the Census Bureau has been advised by attorneys to hold off on releasing the documents until they are filed with the federal courts as part of the lawsuits over the citizenship question. Cummings said the delay \"constrained\" the lawmakers' inquiries. He also expressed disbelief in the Trump administration's reasoning for the citizenship question \u2014 to protect the rights of voters. \"Give me a break!\" Cummings exclaimed.",

It was the latest step in a political career that has focused in large part on faith-based issues. The Sunday before Scott Pruitt's confirmation hearing to run the Environmental Protection Agency, Pruitt stood on the stage of his hometown church, bowed his head, and prayed. \"I stand on a platform today with a man of God who's been tapped to serve our nation,\" said the Rev. Nick Garland, the senior pastor at First Baptist Church in Broken Arrow, Okla. \"It's an honor for the kingdom of God to have a man of God who's going to fill that role,\" said Garland. \"We wanted to pray for you today, and ask God to bless you.\" Embedded featuring Taking Cover\n                \n                    \n                    NPR\n                    \n                \nhide caption The congregation at First Baptist, which is part of the Southern Baptist Convention and has a membership of some 4,500, has counted Pruitt as a member for nearly three decades. Pruitt is also a deacon at the church. Throughout his career, he has relied on the church for both spiritual and political strength. While Pruitt is probably best-known now for his aggressive attempts to roll back Obama-era environmental regulations \u2014 and perhaps for the increasing number of investigations into alleged ethical misconduct \u2014 much of his career has been driven by faith-based issues like abortion and religious freedom. Pruitt and the EPA did not respond to several requests for comment over nearly two months, including a four-page list of questions from NPR. But an examination of Pruitt's public statements and his record shows that his faith continues to inform his views of the environment and climate change. Pruitt's first legal case: a fight over religious freedom Pruitt is originally from Kentucky and went to the University of Kentucky on a baseball scholarship. He played second base and, according to E&E News, his fellow players nicknamed him \"The Possum.\" (\"I thought he looked like a possum,\" the team's shortstop, Billy White, explained.) Pruitt later transferred to Georgetown College, a Baptist school in Georgetown, Ky., before moving to Oklahoma to attend the University Of Tulsa College Of Law. After graduation, Pruitt got his first client, a woman named Judith Lyn Whittington. Judith Lyn Whittington was Scott Pruitt's first legal client. She sued her employer, Oklahoma's Department of Human Services, arguing that the state was infringing on her religious freedom.\n                \n                    \n                    Joe Wertz/StateImpact Oklahoma\n                    \n                \nhide caption Judith Lyn Whittington was Scott Pruitt's first legal client. She sued her employer, Oklahoma's Department of Human Services, arguing that the state was infringing on her religious freedom. In the early 1990s, Whittington sued her employer, Oklahoma's Department Of Human Services, alleging religious discrimination. Whittington had converted to Christianity later in life and was active in her church's crisis pregnancy center, which counsels women not to have abortions. (In general, such centers can be controversial, and medical groups and abortion-rights activists have accused some centers of misleading women.) Whittington also held a Bible study at her home. \"I was a fairly new Christian,\" she says. \"It was very important to me to be able to do the things that I thought God was leading me to do.\" Then came the conflict with her employer. Whittington had become friends with a woman through her work at the crisis pregnancy center. One day, she helped the woman and her young daughter move out of their living situation. Trouble arose, because the woman was also a client of the Department of Human Services. Supervisors at the department disciplined Whittington, because they said she was blurring the lines between her volunteer work for the crisis pregnancy center in her off-hours and her work for the state agency. Whittington says she got a call from one of her supervisors, who told her, \"You're not allowed to have any contact after hours with DHS clients or potential clients.\" As a result, Whittington decided to end her Bible study and stopped volunteering with the crisis pregnancy center. Eventually, she got in touch with the Rutherford Institute, a conservative nonprofit, which connected her with Scott Pruitt. \"He was a young lawyer, but he was a go-getter,\" says Whittington. \"I mean he started working on [the case] that day. He was excited about it.\" And Pruitt's excitement, Whittington says, came from his genuine dedication to religious freedom. \"He saw it as: This is what she truly believes and she has the right to do it,\" she says. The case ultimately was resolved because of a national religious freedom law signed by President Clinton. That law prompted Oklahoma to change its employment policies, and the state settled with Whittington. She was able to resume her work with the crisis pregnancy center and restarted her Bible study. Scott Pruitt's campaign for Oklahoma attorney general in 2010 featured Judith Lyn Whittington's story in an ad. The ad falsely implies that Whittington lost her job over the conflict with her employer, but Whittington still credits Pruitt for his help on the case. Whittington still credits Pruitt with reaching the settlement. \"He was there, a young attorney, when I needed an attorney so badly,\" she says. The case also stuck with Pruitt. He later featured Whittington in a campaign ad, in which he says the case sparked his interest in serving as Oklahoma's attorney general. \"He was so honest, he was so kind, and he was so on fire for God's work,\" Whittington says in the ad. Pruitt's church Soon after Pruitt came to Oklahoma and around the time of the lawsuit, he joined First Baptist Church in Broken Arrow, a suburb just outside Tulsa. Garland describes Pruitt as an active and faithful member of the church who has been involved in Sunday school teaching and eventually became a deacon. Outside the church's worship center, where roughly 2,500 people gather each Sunday, there's a brick wall inscribed with the names of people important to that church and who donated to the church's relocation.

Among the names is Scott Pruitt. On one end of the wall are four bricks, one for each member of the Pruitt family. Over the years, Pruitt and Garland have spent a lot of time together, though Pruitt has had fewer opportunities now that he is in Washington. Garland says Pruitt will still call or text him when he has a big meeting and will ask Garland to pray for him. Garland told Mother Jones that he recently went to a private reception at the EPA with Pruitt. Pruitt is also a former trustee with the Southern Baptist Theological Seminary, and he says his faith forms the foundation of his politics. \"A Christian worldview means that God has answers to our problems,\" said Pruitt, according to the seminary's website. \"And part of our responsibility is to convey to those in society that the answers that he has, as represented in Scripture, are important and should be followed, because they lead to freedom and liberty.\" The Southern Baptist Convention, as well as Garland and Pruitt, oppose same-sex marriage, abortion rights and transgender rights. In one 2016 sermon, Garland criticized the Obama administration's guidance on transgender students and bathrooms. \"In this generation, where people are trying to decide what they believe about sex,\" he said, \"it's because we've forgotten the one who made them male and female. In a generation, where we're not sure if God created, because we've propagandized evolution, we've forgotten that in the beginning, God.\" (Pruitt also sued the Obama administration over that guidance, calling it \"Obama's Transgender Power Play\" in The Wall Street Journal.) On the environment, Garland is also skeptical of the scientific consensus, which has argued for urgent action to prevent the potentially disastrous consequences of climate change. The Rev. Nick Garland, senior pastor at First Baptist Church in Broken Arrow, Okla., stands outside the church's worship center.\n                \n                    \n                    Joe Wertz/StateImpact Oklahoma\n                    \n                \nhide caption The Rev. Nick Garland, senior pastor at First Baptist Church in Broken Arrow, Okla., stands outside the church's worship center. \"Let's be a little more cautious,\" Garland says. \"Let's not overreact on supposition.\" On climate change, Pruitt has argued for a government-sponsored debate on climate science and the potential effects of greenhouse gases. And he recently told the Christian Broadcasting Network that he believes God blessed humanity with natural resources like coal and oil so that people may use them. \"The biblical world view with respect to these issues,\" he said, \"is that we have a responsibility to manage and cultivate, harvest the natural resources that we've been blessed with to truly bless our fellow mankind.\" Translating faith into policy There aren't sufficient scientific facts to establish the theory of evolution. EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt, speaking in 2005 Pruitt was elected to the Oklahoma State Senate in 1998, and an NPR review of legislation he sponsored shows a strong focus on faith-based issues. Early on, he sponsored a state Religious Freedom Act. He also sponsored legislation to provide state funding to faith-based organizations working in juvenile justice. Most years he was in the state Senate, he also sponsored legislation to restrict abortion, including what's known as an \"informed consent\" bill. Such bills mandate language that doctors have to use before performing an abortion. \"[Women] need to know that there's a link with breast cancer,\" Pruitt said in 2003. \"They need to know that there's a risk with infertility; they need to know that there are emotional risks attendant with abortion procedures.\" Leading medical groups say all of those claims are either false or misleading. While voting for another abortion restriction measure in the Oklahoma Senate, Pruitt said, \"I'm voting to say that an unborn child from the moment of conception should be considered a legal person under the 14th Amendment.\" The website for Scott Pruitt's unsuccessful 2006 campaign for Oklahoma lieutenant governor touted Pruitt's support for \"the rights of the unborn\" and \"traditional family values.\"\n                \n\n                    Screenshot by NPR/Internet Archive\n                    \n\nhide caption The website for Scott Pruitt's unsuccessful 2006 campaign for Oklahoma lieutenant governor touted Pruitt's support for \"the rights of the unborn\" and \"traditional family values.\" Such a move would effectively criminalize abortion. Around this time, according to filings NPR obtained from the Oklahoma Ethics Commission, Pruitt served on the board of a crisis pregnancy center in Tulsa. Pruitt also supported a bill called the Teacher Protection Act, which would have required textbooks in Oklahoma to add a 251-word disclaimer about Darwin's theory of evolution. That disclaimer included this line: \"any statement about life's origins should be considered as theory, not fact.\" In a 2005 radio interview first unearthed by Politico, Pruitt said, \"there aren't sufficient scientific facts to establish the theory of evolution.\" When Pruitt became Oklahoma's attorney general after the 2010 election, he continued to pursue many of these priorities. He fought a move by Oklahoma's Supreme Court to remove a public display of the Ten Commandments at the state Capitol, and he joined a lawsuit against the federal government over the Affordable Care Act's contraception mandate. \"Our Founding Fathers established a system to protect us from this type of coercive federal infringement on religious liberty,\" Pruitt argued.

Ambitions beyond the EPA The increasing number of ethics investigations into Pruitt's actions as EPA administrator have raised speculation that President Trump may fire him. In the past century, no presidential Cabinet has seen more turnover in its first year than this administration. Pruitt has argued that the criticism is partisan and says that his opponents will \"resort to anything\" to stop his regulatory rollback at the EPA. On Tuesday, the agency confirmed that two high-level EPA employees \u2014 Albert Kelly and Pasquale Perrotta \u2014 had left the agency. Whatever happens, it has been widely reported that Pruitt has ambitions for other positions, whether senator or governor of Oklahoma or even U.S. attorney general. His record on faith-based issues suggests he would continue to pursue those priorities in other offices. For now, Pruitt joins a weekly Bible study with other members of the Trump Cabinet. He recently told CBN News, \"it's such a wonderful thing\" to pray with \"a friend, a colleague, a person who has a faith [and] focus on how we do our job.\" Tom Dreisbach is a producer with NPR's Embedded; Joe Wertz is a reporter with StateImpact Oklahoma.",

Updated at 1:30 p.m. ET. Winnie Madikizela-Mandela, wife of the late South African leader Nelson Mandela, and a leading anti-apartheid figure in her own right during the country's most turbulent years, has died at age 81. The Mandela family said in a statement that she died Monday in Johannesburg \"after a long illness, for which she had been in and out of hospital since the start of the year.\" South African President Cyril Ramaphosa called her \"an abiding symbol of the desire of our people to be free. In the midst of repression, she was a voice of defiance and resistance.\" During the 27 years Nelson Mandela spent in prison, Madikizela-Mandela was one of the most outspoken critics of South Africa's white government. She was most visible in the 1980s, renowned for revving up crowds of young, black activists with her fierce speeches denouncing the country's comprehensive system of racial segregation. At the time, many blacks referred to her as \"Mother of the Nation.\" As she raised the couple's two young daughters, she was frequently harassed by the government, which at various times put her in prison, placed her under house arrest, banished her to a remote town and kept her under constant surveillance. She and her daughters were rarely allowed to visit Nelson Mandela in prison. In a 2004 interview on The Tavis Smiley Show, Madikizela-Mandela said: \"I probably would have never turned out to be what I am today had it not been the viciousness of apartheid. No human being with any honor and pride could have stood by and be a spectator and witnessed the horrors of apartheid without protesting. You had to fight for your dignity.\" Yet she also became a polarizing figure mired in repeated scandals that included criminal convictions. The most serious was in 1989, when her team of hand-picked bodyguards abducted and killed one of its own members, 14-year-old James \"Stompie\" Seipei, accusing him of being a government informant. Madikizela-Mandela denied involvement. But her chief bodyguard was convicted of the killing. She was convicted of his kidnapping and sentenced to prison, but the sentence was later reduced to a fine.

Nelson Mandela was released in 1990 and walked out of prison with Madikizela-Mandela at his side, both raising clenched fists as black South Africans celebrated nationwide. Mandela then led the negotiations with the white government that would lead to the end of apartheid \u2014 and his election as president \u2014 four years later. Meanwhile, Madikizela-Mandela continued to play a leading role as an activist, frequently appearing at rallies during this tumultuous period, when thousands of South Africans, almost all of them blacks, where killed in political violence. But the couple's relationship was clearly strained and they separated in 1992. They divorced in 1996, while Mandela was serving as the country's first black president. Winnie Madikizela-Mandela returns to the town of Brandfort, where she had been banished by the white government for nine years, to visit local children in 1986.\n                \n                    \n                    Gideon Mendel/AFP/Getty Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption Winnie Madikizela-Mandela returns to the town of Brandfort, where she had been banished by the white government for nine years, to visit local children in 1986. Nelson Mandela met Madikizela-Mandela in 1957 at a bus stop in Soweto, the huge black township just outside Soweto. He was almost 40, already a leading figure in the African National Congress, and she was 22, a young social worker at a hospital. He said he was immediately struck by her beauty. He then divorced his first wife and married Madikizela-Mandela the following year. They soon had two girls, but Mandela was often operating underground and seldom at home. He was arrested and sentenced to life in prison in 1964 for his role in the ANC's sabotage campaign against the white government. Madikizela-Mandela was still in her 20s at the time, but grew to become a spokeswoman for her husband and then a leading activist. She welcomed the media attention and could be a captivating speaker at rallies. While Nelson Mandela was moderate and called for inclusiveness, she was confrontational and defiant, angering not only the white government during the apartheid days, but the ANC in her later years. Madikizela-Mandela held a number of prominent positions in the post-apartheid era, serving as a member of parliament and head of the ANC's Women's League. But her reputation declined sharply due to the repeated controversies. In 1998, the country's Truth and Reconciliation Commission, headed by the Nobel Peace Prize laureate Rev. Desmond Tutu, found Madikizela-Mandela \"politically and morally accountable for the gross violations of human rights\" during the 1980s due to the actions of her bodyguards, who were formally known as the Mandela United Football Club. She was convicted of fraud in 2003 and continued to make provocative statements. In 2010, she was quoted in an interview as saying that her former husband had \"let blacks down.\" The ANC asked her to explain the comments, and issued a statement on her behalf claiming the interview was a fabrication.",

The first 10 changes to the Constitution were easy. Since then, it has been an uphill battle every time, and some of those battles are, at least technically, still undecided. We are speaking of the amendments to the U.S. Constitution, and those first 10 are, of course, better known as the Bill of Rights. They provide some of the most important guarantees of freedom associated with the U.S. Constitution \u2014 even though they were added years after the Constitution was first written in the summer of 1787. It wasn't that the framers of the Constitution didn't believe in freedom of the press or freedom of religion \u2014 or the right to own guns or have a fair trial. They clearly did. But many, including influential framer James Madison, believed these rights were implicit in the Constitution itself (and in the constitutions of the individual states). Madison and others considered a separate catalog of rights unnecessary and potentially troublesome because of what it might omit. In the process of ratifying that new Constitution 230 years ago, the founders got some pushback from the states. There was popular demand for spelling out citizens' freedoms and rights explicitly \u2014 so as to make them as clear and inviolable as the Constitution itself. So, when the first Congress met in 1789, Madison himself (a member of the House from Virginia) brought forth a package of 12 amendments \u2014 formally introduced just six weeks after George Washington had taken the oath as the first president. These \"further declaratory and restrictive clauses\" were soon passed with two-thirds votes of the House and the Senate. Ten of these were ratified in short order by the states, making them part of the Constitution as of Dec. 15, 1791. But two of Madison's original dozen were left behind, failing to get the three-fourths of the states of the time. One provided a formula for determining the number of seats in the House of Representatives, and the other said that congressional pay raises could not take effect until after the next election for the House. The zombie amendment These became what might be called orphan amendments, abandoned partway through the process. But Congress had included no expiration date on them, so they could also be called zombie amendments \u2014 kept in a suspended condition indefinitely, neither finally dead nor fully alive. In fact, one of those two early amendments, the one about the pay raise, actually came back to life. It was dusted off in the late 1980s \u2014 in the midst of a fracas over congressional pay \u2014 and states once again began voting on its ratification. Lo and behold, the necessary 38 states signed on, and, in 1992, the amendment that Congress had blessed way back in 1789, was finally ratified. It is now the 27th Amendment to the Constitution, the last (or at least most recent) of the amendments and one of only two added in the past 50 years. Altogether, the Constitution has only been amended 17 times since the Bill of Rights, and one of those amendments (the 21st) was done just to repeal another (the 18th, known as Prohibition). Five amendments have dealt with presidential succession, elections or terms in office. A flurry of amendments after the Civil War abolished slavery, guaranteed equal protection under the law and banned racial discrimination. A successor amendment in the 1960s banned the poll tax, often used to keep African-Americans from voting in states that once had slavery. Other momentous amendments have granted women the right to vote (19th), lowered the voting age to 18 from 21 (26th), imposed the income tax (16th) and provided for the direct election of senators by the voters rather than by state legislatures (17th). The Equal Rights Amendment that still hasn't been But not all the amendments passed by Congress have stood the test of ratification by the states. Counting that very first item in Madison's package, there are six in all. Call them orphans, oddities or zombies, but considering how much time has passed, it is perhaps most amazing that there have been so few. The best known of these in our time is the Equal Rights Amendment, which provided that \"Equality of rights under the law shall not be denied or abridged by the United States or by any state on account of sex.\" It was the culmination of the women's rights movement of the 1960s and 1970s. Its bipartisan support carried it to two-thirds majorities in the House and Senate in the 1970s. It went out to the states in 1972 of states with a full head of steam. But the number of ratifying states stalled out at 35 \u2014 three short of the 38 required. Eventually, the seven-year time frame Congress had set for ratification was extended by three years. But, by this point, a strong opposition movement had arisen, blocking ratification in the remaining states and persuading some state legislatures to reconsider and rescind their ratification. One key element in this opposition was the Eagle Forum, led by Phyllis Schlafly, a prominent social conservative from Alton, Ill. She argued that the ERA could force unwanted changes on women who preferred their traditional roles. For example, Schlafly and others argued the ERA could subject women to a military draft. Despite having a full decade to win ratification, the ERA fell short and expired in 1982. Still taxation without representation A similar fate befell the Voting Rights Amendment for the District of Columbia. Passed by Congress in 1978, it would have given citizens of the nation's capital city the same full representation in Congress as any state (one voting representative in the House and two senators). This amendment, too, survived a battle in Congress, where some conservatives argued the Constitution had been wise to restrict D.C., so that it did not become an overly powerful center of national politics on the model of London or Paris. The states proved less than enthusiastic, and the seven-year expiration date Congress had added as part of the deal (as with the ERA) meant the amendment died in 1985. (It should be noted that another amendment, the 23rd, at least gave D.C. a chance to participate in the Electoral College with three electoral votes \u2014 just as it would have if it were a state. That amendment was ratified in 1961.) For either of these amendments to go back to the states for another round of ratification votes, it would have to first be passed by two-thirds votes in the Congress. It is far from certain that either could surmount that hurdle in the current House and Senate. Three other zombies that linger There are three other amendments that remain in zombie space, as it were, as they have never been ratified by three-fourths of the states, but have never expired: 1. The oldest is the Titles of Nobility Amendment, first sent to the states in 1810 on the verge of the second war with Great Britain (to be known as the War of 1812). It provided that any American citizen who accepted or received any title of nobility from a foreign power (or accepted any gift from such a power without the consent of Congress) would forfeit his or her American citizenship. This amendment came close to ratification, with a dozen states giving thumbs-up within two years. But there were 17 states as of 1803, so the Anti-Title Amendment fell short. No states have since joined in, but in the absence of an expiration clause, this amendment remains technically available. The next of the zombies had a far shorter interval of viability but conjures a moment of maximum tension in U.S. history. 2. It was known as the Corwin Amendment after the Ohio congressman who proposed it, but it has been remembered as the Slavery Amendment. Passed by Congress in 1861, on the eve of the Civil War, the Slavery Amendment sought to halt the secession movement by guaranteeing the federal government would not abolish slavery or otherwise interfere with the \"domestic institutions of any state, including that of persons held to labor or service by the laws of said State.\" It came too late to appease the seceding states, which would eventually number 11. But it was ratified by two of the slave-holding states that did not leave the Union. Needless to say, interest in this measure was superseded by the 1865 passage and ratification of the 13th Amendment, abolishing slavery and involuntary servitude. But technically, the Slavery Amendment has never expired and remains outstanding. 3. The latest of this group of still-pending amendments is the Child Labor Amendment, granting the Congress power to regulate the labor of children under the age of 18. It was ratified by 28 states, far short of the 36 required at the time. The last state to ratify did so in 1937, nearly a decade after Congress had passed this amendment, but none has signed on since, largely because other laws enacted since (principally the Fair Labor Standards Act) have accomplished much of the amendment's intent.",

            "article_content": "Andr\u00e9 Holland did research with the Equal Justice Initiative in order to prepare for his role as a lawyer on the Hulu series Castle Rock.\n\n                    \n                    Patrick Harbron/Hulu\n                    \n                \nhide caption Andr\u00e9 Holland did research with the Equal Justice Initiative in order to prepare for his role as a lawyer on the Hulu series Castle Rock. Growing up in rural Alabama, actor Andr\u00e9 Holland spent countless Friday and Saturday nights sitting around on the front porch, listening to people tell stories. Looking back now, Holland credits those evenings \u2014 and the cadences he heard on the porch \u2014 with inspiring him to become an actor. Holland, who appeared in the film Moonlight, is currently playing Othello in Shakespeare's Globe in London \u2014 without a British accent. When he auditioned for a Shakespeare production earlier in his career, he was told by a casting agent to eliminate his \"southern sound.\" There's a sense, Holland says, that to do Shakespeare, you must \"elevate yourself to meet the text.\" But he rejects that idea; his grandparents were capable of expressing complex and beautiful ideas in their own way. \"The way they told those stories sounded a lot like Shakespeare,\" Holland says. \"Even to this day, when I call home and speak to my father ... [there's a] rhythm that we communicate in, and I feel like that has as much a place on the Globe Stage or any stage as does any kind of well-spoken, well-trained, perfectly-delivered mid-Atlantic sound.\" Holland also stars as a lawyer who works with death row inmates on the Hulu series Castle Rock, which is based on the work of Stephen King. On doing research with the Equal Justice Initiative to prepare for the Castle Rock role I just felt like I needed to understand what the process is that one goes through when defending an inmate who's on death row, and then also what the emotional toll is that that takes on a person. So one of the people who I spoke with ... who's an attorney there at EJI, really was very generous and walked me through it, and told me sort of step-by-step what it feels like and what some of the interactions are that she's had with inmates. ... Part of [it] is just that living in limbo that a lot of her clients feel, that sort of day-to-day not knowing if today is going to be that last day. And the sort of desperation and the look in their eyes as she comes in to meet with them \u2014 that sort of hope and also despair and resignation as well, and what that does to her. I just wanted to know what it felt like to carry that responsibility. She spoke about how often at the very, very last minute they'll come up with an idea that will get them to stay \u2014 that will extend the life of that individual just a little bit longer \u2014 and how sort of improvised a lot of that work is. On getting cast in Moonlight as the oldest of three Kevins, and how he never met the younger actors playing his same character We were cast and never met each other prior to filming. None of the Kevins met. None of the Chirons met. [Director] Barry [Jenkins] intentionally wanted it to be that way. ... He didn't want us to meet. I think he was concerned that we might fall into some sort of mimicry. ... Yesi Ramirez, who cast the film, did a wonderful job of finding actors who had a similar sensibility and look that maybe wasn't identical, but there was an essence about us that was the same. Then Barry, some of his framing and shot selection helped to tie the three parts of the story together. Now some of us, myself included, did sort of sneak around and I went to wardrobe one day, and \u2014 I don't know Barry knows this \u2014 and asked to see some photographs of the actor that they cast, just so I can get an idea of what it looked like, and they let me have a peek, but that was about all I could get out of them. On growing up in Bessemer, Ala. It was kind of a beautiful childhood, as I look back on it. ... Bessemer itself is a community that struggles financially. It's a very working class community. A lot of people are struggling and certainly were struggling back then as well, but I was raised in a house that was full of love and we never felt the lack \u2014 even though there certainly was \u2014 we never we felt it. And [I] had parents, have parents who just taught me to believe in myself, and to believe that anything was possible. On being called a racial slur by the first girl he liked \u2014 it was on Valentine's Day when he was in the fourth grade We went to school that morning and made, out of construction paper, we made these little mailboxes and bought our Valentine's cards and went around in the morning and passed them out and then at the end of the day we got to open our mailboxes and see all the mail that we had gotten and open our Valentine's cards. I remember opening mine and noticing that the one that I put into the box of this young girl \u2014 Brooke was her name \u2014 the one I put in Brooke's box had ended up back in my box. I opened it up and looked at it and on the front it said \"Happy Valentine's Day, I love you, to Brooke from Andr\u00e9,\" and I turned it over and she had written in pencil, \"I hate you, n*****.\" I remember holding that card and being really in shock and getting in the car with my mother later that day and sitting in the back seat and holding it and wanting to tell her what had happened, but feeling so ashamed of myself, I guess, that I didn't tell her. And instead I took it home and hid it in my dresser drawer. I still have it to this day. On feeling \"in the middle\" of two communities I had a cousin who I was very close to growing up ... and he got involved in some bad activity \u2014 essentially he and some other people who I know had a very, very bad idea to try and burglarize this little five and dime store that's in an area where we grew up in. And after they had gone in and ... they stole a few hundred dollars or whatever it was that they got, on the way out my cousin, who was 17 at the time, was shot in the back by the store owner ... and he died that night. The store owner was also my baseball coach. [I grew up] not quite knowing where I fit, how I fit, if I fit. And a lot of the characters that I play, choose to play, are also wrestling with similar things \u2014 that question of identity and where they fit. Andr\u00e9 Holland So there's always been down where I grew up just, like, really kind of complicated friction between people in the community that I grew up in [and] the white people who also sort of share that same community, or the community sort of adjacent to it. There's always been this tension. I've often felt sort of in the middle of that, definitely belonging to my own family and my own culture and my own neighborhood, but then also ... I went to a private school that was on the other side of town. And just not quite knowing where I fit, how I fit, if I fit. And a lot of the characters that I play, choose to play, are also wrestling with similar things \u2014 that question of identity and where they fit.

            "article_content": "A federal judge heard arguments in New York City for the largest of the six lawsuits brought against the citizenship question the Trump administration added to the 2020 census.  ARI SHAPIRO, HOST: Today a judge gave a legal victory to critics of the new citizenship question that the Trump administration added to the 2020 census. The court ordered the administration to release more internal documents about how it decided to add the question. More than two dozen states and cities are suing to get it removed. They fear the question will harm the accuracy of the numbers that are used to reapportion seats in Congress and distribute federal funds. NPR's Hansi Lo Wang was at the courthouse and joins us now. Hi, Hansi. HANSI LO WANG, BYLINE: Hey, Ari. SHAPIRO: Remind us what's at stake here. WANG: Well, the Trump administration says the Voting Rights Act is what's driving this push for a citizenship question on their behalf. They say the Justice Department needs a better count of citizens in order to enforce Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act which has provisions against racial discrimination. But the fact is the Census Bureau has not asked all U.S. households about citizenship status since 1950. And critics of this question, including more than the two dozen states and cities part of this largest lawsuit in Manhattan - they say that this current political climate, this increase immigration enforcement under the Trump administration really will discourage a lot of noncitizens, including their citizen relatives, from participating in the headcount in 2020. It's a constitutional requirement, and an inaccurate count of every person living in the country has a direct impact on how many seats in Congress each state gets, how legislative districts are drawn and how an estimated $800 billion a year in federal funds are distributed. SHAPIRO: So tell us more about what exactly the judge decided today. WANG: Well, the Justice Department has been requesting the judge to dismiss this case. The judge did not make a ruling, although he did say that it's not likely that he will dismiss the case in Manhattan in its entirety. And then he ruled on this motion to force the government - the federal - the Trump administration release more documents from the Commerce Department and the Justice Department, and he approved that motion. Just for full disclosure, I've filed for a Freedom of Information Act request - excuse me - on behalf of NPR for those documents as well. And the Commerce Department has already released more than 3,000 pages. And the judge cited one of those memos today and said that in that memo released by Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross, he revealed that he actually asked the Justice Department staff if they would submit a request for a citizenship question. So the judge says based on that new memo, it appears that this question for a citizenship question did not originate from the Justice Department, and that's enough to grant this request to see more documents, to see exactly what went into this decision. And, you know, outside the courthouse, there was a lot of cheering from critics of this question. Folks have been very skeptical of the Trump administration's reasoning that the Voting Rights Act is what's driving this. And one of those critics is Elizabeth OuYang of the New York Immigration Coalition. She's leading this New York Counts 2020 campaign. Let's listen to what she said. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) ELIZABETH OUYANG: The public must see the elephant in this courtroom - the intention to make America white again. We know the hard-fought and ongoing struggle for diversity and inclusion in this country, and we will not go back. WANG: You know, what OuYang is referring to is that fears that a lot of, you know, noncitizens are people of color and that if they're scared from participating from the census, that they won't be included in these really important numbers. SHAPIRO: The 2020 census may be two years off, but the questionnaire needs to be finalized soon. Is this going to be resolved in time? WANG: Well, the judge said that he hopes this case moves quickly. He set a tentative trial date in New York City on Halloween, although he emphasized that he does not expect to be the final word on whatever he decides. He's expecting appeals. And remember; there are five other lawsuits currently against this question. Another thing to keep in mind is the midterm elections in November. Democrats - if they win back the House, some lawmakers say they might propose bills to try to remove this question before 2020 starts. SHAPIRO: That's NPR's Hansi Lo Wang covering the census for us, and - appreciate your coverage of this case, which I know you will keep covering. Thanks for joining us. WANG: You're very welcome.

Senior medical student Giselle Lynch has plenty of accomplishments to list when she applies for a coveted spot in an ophthalmology residency program this fall. But one box she won't be able to check when she submits her application is one of the highest academic awards medical students can receive, election to the honor society Alpha Omega Alpha. It's not because she didn't excel. It's because her medical school, the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai in New York City, put a moratorium on student nominations because it determined the selection process discriminates against students of color. The award is open to the top 25 percent of a medical school's graduating class and can be a valuable career boost, making students more competitive for desirable residencies and jobs. Icahn administrators say the disparities in the selection process reflect deeper issues of racial inequality in medical education. \"AOA perpetuates systems that are deeply flawed,\" says Dr. David Muller, the dean for medical education at Icahn. \"We can't justify putting people who are historically at a disadvantage at an even greater disadvantage. It just doesn't seem fair to dangle in front of our students an honorific that we know people are not equally eligible for.\" \"AOA is an award of student excellence,\" says Lynch, who led student efforts at Icahn to fight racial inequality at the school. \"What was the argument that was being perpetuated about us if we're not being included?\"\n                \n                    \n                    Gabriela Bhaskar for NPR\n                    \n                \nhide caption \"AOA is an award of student excellence,\" says Lynch, who led student efforts at Icahn to fight racial inequality at the school. \"What was the argument that was being perpetuated about us if we're not being included?\" Over the past five years, around 3 percent of students chosen for the distinction at Icahn were from a racial background that is underrepresented in medicine, which includes blacks and Latinos. In that same period, about 18 percent to 20 percent of each graduating class at Icahn came from those groups. The school made the change after Lynch led a group of fellow students in an effort to fight inequality at Icahn. The students collected data on how many students from underrepresented minorities were nominated to the honor society at Icahn and presented it in a series of meetings with school leadership last year. Lynch, who is black, recalls one particularly moving meeting when they showed photographs of Icahn's past AOA students \u2014 and black and Latino faces were conspicuously sparse. \"Where are we? We're nowhere here,\" says Lynch, remembering her reaction. \"AOA is an award of student excellence. What was the argument that was being perpetuated about us if we're not being included?\" Announced in May of this year, the decision at Icahn was a controversial one, because many students and faculty fear that not participating in the award puts Icahn students at a disadvantage when competing for slots in residency programs. The honor society has existed since 1902 and is a sought-after line on the  r\u00e9sum\u00e9s of medical students across the country. Membership can help students secure training in competitive specialties and is a predictor of success in academic medicine. Membership is generally open to the top 25 percent of medical students in a graduating class, as determined by their grades and scores on standardized tests, but only about 16 percent makes it in. Each medical school has its own criteria for making final selections including qualities like leadership or professionalism. \"AOA perpetuates systems that are deeply flawed,\" says Dr. David Muller, the dean for medical education at Icahn.\n                \n                    \n                    Gabriela Bhaskar for NPR\n                    \n                \nhide caption \"AOA perpetuates systems that are deeply flawed,\" says Dr. David Muller, the dean for medical education at Icahn. Icahn is not alone in selecting a disproportionately low number of minority students for the honor society. A 2017 study in JAMA Internal Medicine showed that nationwide, black and Asian students were less likely than their white counterparts to be selected for the honor. Dr. Dowin Boatright, the study's lead author and an assistant professor of emergency medicine at Yale, hypothesizes that the disparities may be related to racial inequalities in grading and standardized tests, a phenomenon well-documented in medical education literature. Grading based on clinical performance is subjective, he notes, since it often reflects a global assessment of a student rather than technical skills or performance on a test. \"You're graded on things that are completely vulnerable to bias, like, 'How good is this medical student?' \" Boatright says. Other medical schools are also considering how their AOA chapters can accurately reflect the racial makeup of their student bodies, according to Dr. Eve Higginbotham, the president of AOA board. And at the University of California, San Francisco, faculty and students are debating whether the honor society has a future there. \"Systems we use [for student evaluation] fail to take into account the extra work minorities are doing,\" says Dr. Catherine Lucey, vice dean for education at UCSF.  \"[Minority] students have more stressors they have to deal with, low levels of racism that exist in our patients and our clinical environments.\" Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai in New York City is reconsidering its participation in Alpha Omega Alpha.\n                \n                    \n                    Gabriela Bhaskar for NPR\n                    \n                \nhide caption Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai in New York City is reconsidering its participation in Alpha Omega Alpha. Lucey says that UCSF changed its selection criteria for AOA in 2016 to focus less on grades. The number of minority students selected for the honor society that year increased to match the percentage of minorities in each graduating class. Dr. Jonathan Giftos, an internist in New York who was president of the Icahn chapter when he graduated in 2012, says disparities in the honor society are important to address because when medical education favors white students that can mean fewer minorities in leadership roles. \"It feels like a layering on of accolades that makes people who are doing well do better, have more access and power and opportunity,\" Giftos says. National AOA leadership says that diversity is a priority for the organization, but since every medical school is different, they leave the specifics of how students are chosen up to the school. \"We know that improving diversity will hopefully result in inclusion of talented individuals from different backgrounds, and that will help benefit our patient care,\" says Dr. Richard Byyny, executive director of AOA. \"But the schools themselves need to tackle this.\" Muller notes that Icahn has not officially closed its AOA chapter and will still nominate faculty and residents. And student activists at Icahn aren't celebrating yet. Lynch says she now wants to focus on discrimination in grading and medical school admissions. This, she says, can help address the dearth of minority physicians in different specialities \u2014 a problem with negative consequences for the health of minority patients. \"Many of us are still wary,\" Lynch says. \"It is a symbolic gesture, actually. We are interested in the deeper work.\" Mara Gordon is a family physician in Washington, D.C., and a health and media fellow at NPR and Georgetown University School of Medicine.",

In all, 13 of the cases decided by a liberal-conservative split, Justice Anthony Kennedy provided the fifth and deciding conservative vote. For four decades, the Supreme Court has been like a balance board, tilting this way and that. And, while it has moved more and more to the right with each reset, the center has held. This term, and for the foreseeable future, however, the board looks more like a slide. Justice Anthony Kennedy, who announced his retirement this week, may feel secure in his legacy. But Justice Sandra Day O'Connor did, too, only to be disappointed. In the early 2000s, Justice O'Connor sat at the center of the court alongside Justice Kennedy. When she retired, she thought her legacy was secure \u2013 including the protection of women's rights, abortion rights and the ability of the legislative branch of the government to regulate campaign money in order to prevent influence peddling and corruption. In subsequent years, she would privately make clear how unhappy she was with her replacement \u2014 Samuel Alito \u2014 for what she perceived as the undermining much of that legacy. Now, it is Anthony Kennedy. After 30 years on the court, he believes that once rights are recognized, they will not be taken away. That includes the right to abortion that he helped to preserve and the rights for gay people that he helped establish \u2014 including the right to marry and to be treated equally. Time, of course, will tell. But every indication is that President Trump in a little over a week will pick someone who does not think that those are rights fully protected by the Constitution. Once a nominee is confirmed, the only real question will be how far he or she will go to undermine or outright reverse the Supreme Court's prior rulings on these and other subjects \u2014 from regulation of the environment to presidential powers. The Supreme Court term that just concluded was a small taste of what is to come. In all, 13 of the cases decided by a liberal-conservative split, Justice Kennedy provided the fifth and deciding conservative vote. Moreover, his unwillingness to take a clear position on the question of partisan gerrymandering meant that the court punted on the issue for now and probably for generations to come. Technically, the court could again consider whether partisan gerrymandering is ever so extreme that it justifies being policed by the courts. But, in reality, Justice Kennedy's vote was the only one that was really up for grabs, with the rest of the court split between the liberals, who favor intervention in extreme cases, and the conservatives unilaterally opposed. Similarly, while a cake designer who refused to design a wedding cake for a gay couple technically won his case, the court left unresolved the issue of whether commercial business owners can refuse to sell products and services to gay people because of the business owner's religious beliefs. Justice Kennedy's vote was pivotal, too, in sustaining the Trump travel ban, a decision that enhances the president's powers to regulate immigration in the name of national security. His vote was critical in throwing out a California law that required anti-abortion health clinics to post signs informing patients that the clinics are not licensed medical facilities. On the voting rights front, he cast the decisive fifth vote making it easier for states to purge voters from the rolls when they haven't cast a ballot for two consecutive elections. And in a case involving the 2011 Texas redistricting, he joined a decision written by Justice Alito that made it more difficult to challenge racial gerrymanders that dilute the power of minority voters. In that case, Trump appointee Neil Gorsuch joined Justice Clarence Thomas in his long-held but until now idiosyncratic view, that the Voting Rights Act does not cover the drawing of legislative districts at all. Justice Kennedy's vote was also decisive in two other cases, involving workers' rights: One declared that employees have no right to sue their employers as a group when the employer has in place a waiver of the right to sue. The decision involved several large employers who have standard provisions that bar all their workers from bringing class-action suits on any subject \u2014 from wage grievances to sex and race discrimination claims. While that decision undercut the ability of private employees to challenge their employers in court, a second decision undercut the effectiveness of labor unions. In Janus v. AFSCME, Justice Alito capped a six-year campaign to weaken the influence of labor unions. Overturning a 41-year-old Supreme Court precedent, he wrote the decision for the conservative majority declaring that it is unconstitutional to require nonunion members who work for state and local governments to pay partial fees to help pay for negotiating a contract that, by law, provides salary raises and benefits for union and nonunion workers alike. The conservative majority called such partial fees \"compelled speech,\" in violation of the First Amendment. The liberal minority noted that 28 states do not allow such partial fees, but 22 do, and making that choice, the liberals contended, should be up to the state governments. The decision undoes a careful compromise on labor rights that has, for more than four decades, promoted \"labor peace\" and enabled more efficient government, the dissenters said. But the majority said the price for peace and efficiency cannot be paid by compelling individuals to support the labor unions, their goals and their influence. Taken together, the labor decision for public employees and the decision barring class actions by private employees are bound to have significant economic consequences for workers in both sectors. In states where Republican governors have recently gotten legislation enacted to get rid of mandatory union fees, there has been a dramatic drop in union membership and union dues. So has the influence of labor unions, and the salaries and benefits they have been able to negotiate for their members. There may be more of this in store for private employees, even those who are unionized. The same groups that for years have fought fair-share fees in the public sector may next target fair-share fees in unionized workplaces in the private sector. On all of these questions and more, expect the Supreme Court to be far more conservative in the future. Justice Kennedy, even when he cast conservative votes this term, clearly had a restraining hand in the crafting of some of the court's decisions. And on some other controversial subjects in the past, he has as well. For instance, when the court ruled for the first time that there is an individual right to own a gun, the opinion, written by gun enthusiast Antonin Scalia, included a section that was clearly the price of Justice Kennedy's vote, noting that reasonable regulations in the name of public safety are permissible. Since then, the court has for the most part stayed away from gun regulation cases, to the consternation of gun rights advocates. But that will not continue forever, and the restraining hand of Justice Kennedy will no longer be on the court. That will leave Chief Justice John Roberts with the next move. Though a consistent conservative, he occasionally has voted with the court's liberals, as he did this year in declaring that police must obtain a warrant to obtain cellphone location information from service providers. Few doubt that any new Supreme Court justice appointed by Trump will move the court decidedly to the right, but as professor Rick Hasen, of the University of California, Irvine, put it this week, \"The question is how John Roberts wants to move.\" Court observers have \"spent the last 11 years asking what Anthony Kennedy had for breakfast,\" he said. Now it's \" 'What did John Roberts have for breakfast?' and it's a slightly different menu.\"",

If elected, she would be the first black woman to serve as governor in the country, and only the third black governor elected in the 50 states.\n                \n                    \n                    Asma Khalid/NPR\n                    \n                \nhide caption Stacey Abrams is running for governor in Georgia. If elected, she would be the first black woman to serve as governor in the country, and only the third black governor elected in the 50 states. At Columbia Drive United Methodist church in Decatur, Ga., the congregation bowed their heads under a brightly lit cross and prayed for their fellow worshiper \u2014 Stacey Abrams, the former minority leader in the Georgia legislature now running for governor. \"We want to pray for Stacey Abrams,\" the pastor said, as people in the pews shouted \"Yeah, that's right\" in agreement. \"We want to pray, with her the season may change - that with her being elected as the governor of the great state of Georgia that all of those ideas from the current administration be answered to the way of righteousness.\" It was not lost on anyone at church the significance of what Abrams is trying to do. Not a single sitting governor in any of the 50 states is black. In fact, in the history of the United States only two African-American men have ever been elected governor. If elected she would not only become one of the few black governors in American history, she would also be the nation's first black female governor. Abrams, who faces a competitive primary against Democrat Stacey Evans on May 22, stepped up to the pulpit with a lesson from the scripture on voting, power, and the allocation of resources. \"I was sitting back there thinking about Esther chapter 4, verse 14,\" she said. \"And it's a verse that says, 'If you remain silent at this time, there will be salvation that comes for others, but you and your family may not see it.'\" This year, at least eight black candidates are running for governor across the country. They include candidates in Florida, Georgia, Kansas, Maryland, Wisconsin and Oklahoma. \"In terms of there being viable black candidates running for governor, this is definitely the biggest opportunity and biggest time we've seen this much at once,\" said Quentin James, the founder of the Collective PAC, a national group focused on recruiting, training and funding progressive black candidates. But despite the numbers running this year, individually, they all face an uphill battle. Voters seek visible black leadership \"I believe the only way to win Georgia is to... essentially get Democrats who have too often been overlooked and unheard to believe that this time if they engage, we can win,\" Abrams said. Her stump speech makes a nod to what her candidacy represents. She tells the story of being a high school valedictorian who was stopped when she was trying to attend a party for valedictorians with the governor. She says a guard told her, \"This is a private event, you don't belong here.\" \"I'm running for governor because I intend to... open those gates wide so no one ever doubts they belong in our Georgia,\" she told voters on a recent campaign stop in Marietta. Standing in the crowd was Ben Williams, 76, from nearby Mableton. He said he sees Abrams' run as a seismic change in politics - on the level of Barack Obama's election. \"We're in the deep south,\" he said. \"Stacey Abrams being elected as the first woman and the first black person of a southern state (would be) tremendous. Tremendous.\" In multiple interviews with black voters at Abrams events \u2014 and even in some interviews with voters at Evans events - issues of representation and race were common. \"Definitely having somebody that looks like you to represent you, always helps. But that doesn't mean it starts and stops there,\" said Gee Smalls, 41. He was at a lounge in Atlanta with his husband to hear from Abrams primary opponent Stacey Evans, who is white. Smalls said he's still undecided about his vote, but the race of the candidate carries some weight. \"[Abrams] does experience some of the same discriminations that we experience, that her opponent Evans will never be able to experience,\" he said. Over 30 percent of Georgia's eligible voting population is black, and the state is expected to become majority-minority by 2025, according to estimates from the States of Change project. Democrat Stacey Abrams greets voters at an early vote event in DeKalb County, Ga. Abrams is in a competitive Democratic primary with an opponent who shares the same first name, Stacey Evans.\n                \n                    \n                    Asma Khalid/NPR\n                    \n                \nhide caption Democrat Stacey Abrams greets voters at an early vote event in DeKalb County, Ga. Abrams is in a competitive Democratic primary with an opponent who shares the same first name, Stacey Evans. But that demography coupled with the lack of visible black leadership has led to some frustration. \"Black people have been very loyal in the Democratic party,\" said Aimee Allison, president of Democracy in Color, a national organization focused on race and politics. \"They're brand loyal. And white Democrats have counted on the black vote for electoral success.\" Allison lives in California, but she's one of many black women who flew to Georgia to help Abrams get out the vote. National groups like BlackPAC and Higher Heights for America are also investing in the race \u2014 helping with phone banking, door knocking and ads \u2014 specifically targeting African-American voters. Racial roadblocks and opportunity Historically, activists and analysts say black candidates have faced two major roadblocks to the governorship: Money and race, which can appear intertwined. Last month, Setti Warren dropped out of the governor's race in Massachusetts specifically citing his trouble fundraising. \"The money just isn't there to run the kind of campaign I want to run,\" he said in a statement. In Maryland, Prince George's County executive Rushern Baker is one of three African-Americans running for governor in the Democratic primary. Although he's considered one of the front-runners in a crowded field, he too said it was difficult for him to get people to support his campaign early on. \"The first issue issue for any person of color running statewide, the first thing they'll ask you about is money \u2014 'we don't think you can raise money,'\" said Baker. \"It's not even that you don't have the money, or we're gonna help you and see how you do. It's an issue about whether you have the ability to raise money.\" Then, if the Democratic leadership gets over that hurdle, Baker says there will be questions about whether you can realistically win. Four years ago, Democrats in Maryland elected an African-American as their nominee for governor \u2014 Anthony Brown. Brown went on to lose the governor's race to Republican Larry Hogan, even though there were twice as many registered Democrats as Republicans in the state. \"The question I get asked... is, 'How are you going to be different from Anthony Brown?\" said Baker. He thinks that question is biased and not as frequently asked of any of the white candidates running. Instead, Baker points to the 2006 election when Maryland was in a similar situation - two white Democrats trying to take on a sitting Republican governor, and he said the establishment didn't question the credentials of the Democrats at that time. \"People don't believe black candidates can win,\" said James. \"If you look at Georgia right now, that's been a big thing we've been hearing about Stacey Abrams, 'We like Stacey, but can she win statewide?'\" Political strategists say part of the issue is that we still live in segregated communities, and black politicians often get their start with majority-black constituencies as mayors or congressmen. It can be difficult to then translate that political reputation to a statewide office. But practical reasons aside, James is frustrated because he says the Democratic party will often clear the field for their favored candidate, but not for black candidates. \"No one lines up to have our backs early on,\" said James. \"Now, they'll get behind us if we win the primary, but it's such a cost to do so.\" But in a situation like Maryland \u2014 where there are three black candidates running for governor \u2014 that idea of clearing the field is more complicated. In addition to Baker, there are two other black candidates: Valerie Ervin, who's campaigning in place of her deceased running mate, and Ben Jealous, the former NAACP president who is trying to position himself as the progressive option, calling for Medicare for all and tuition-free college. Baker said people sometime ask the African-American candidates how they're going to differentiate themselves. Jealous said the fact that there are multiple black candidates is a sign of progress. Ben Jealous, former president of the NAACP, is one of two African-American men running for governor in the Maryland Democratic primary.\n                \n                    \n                    Asma Khalid/NPR\n                    \n                \nhide caption Ben Jealous, former president of the NAACP, is one of two African-American men running for governor in the Maryland Democratic primary. \"In a pluralistic society, you can have a pluralistic diverse set of candidates, where multiple racial groups have more than one candidate from their racial group and the voters have a choice,\" said Jealous. Research has shown that when there are candidates of color on the ballot it can motivate people of color to vote. So Jealous, like Abrams in Georgia, sees untapped voter potential. \"What most Americans fail to realize is you also have swing voters in the black community who swing between voting \u2014 typically for a Democrat \u2014 and not voting at all,\" he said. For Jealous, and other black candidates, the idea of leadership that more accurately resembles the base of the Democratic Party isn't just about representation. Representation is tied to to their strategy for winning.",

Voters in Anchorage, Alaska, narrowly rejected a controversial proposal last week that would have banned transgender people from using bathrooms that correspond to their gender identity. The \"bathroom bill,\" as it was called, mirrored legislation passed in North Carolina in 2016. The election result was a surprise to many in Alaska's largest city. It has implications for the upcoming midterm elections in other states and may provide a playbook for similar state-level battles. The results are a major shift from just six years ago. In 2012 municipal elections, voters rejected a broad equal rights ordinance on the ballot. The same anti-discrimination measures were eventually passed by the city's assembly in 2015. The Prop. 1 effort was a narrowed attempt to repeal some of those expanded protections, and is similar to bills introduced in other state legislatures, as well as two ballot measures that could go before voters in Montana and Massachusetts this November. In a statement, ACLU of Alaska Executive Director Joshua A. Decker wrote, \"For the first time anywhere in our nation a standalone, anti-transgender 'bathroom bill' \u2013 Prop. 1 \u2013 was defeated at the ballot box.\" The organization was one of the main opponents of the local measure. \"I would expect the understanding of what happened here to reverberate through the community very quickly, because it really was both a local and national effort here in Anchorage,\" says Casey Reynolds, spokesperson for the ACLU of Alaska. Watching the votes being tallied last week in the days following Anchorage's municipal election was tense for resident Lillian Lennon. \"I, of course, was a little nervous because it was like the final count-down,\" Lennon says of watching the last ballot results tabulated Friday afternoon. Lennon, a transgender woman, is a field organizer for Fair Anchorage, a group that spent more than a year organizing against what became Proposition 1, the bathroom bill. To the surprise of many in Anchorage, including some of the campaign's organizers, the measure failed. As of April 9, there were 4,120 more \"no\" votes than \"yes\" votes, a little more than 5 percent of the ballots cast. Lennon attributes the results to a coalition that included civil rights organizations, religious groups, the business community, and moderate Republicans. \"We were able to pull together a really strong trans-centered education campaign,\" Lennon says. \"Really show the lives of trans people and their families.\" Others point to the relatively high turnout in the city's first-ever election done by mail-in ballots, with the 78,113 votes cast representing nearly 36 percent of the electorate. Also on the ballot was a popular progressive mayor running for re-election at a time when many on the left are energized by national politics. But not everyone agrees with that analysis. \"A million dollars buys a lot of confusion,\" says Jim Minnery, president of Alaska Family Action, a Christian policy advocacy group. Minnery chaired the \"Protect Our Privacy\" campaign in favor of the bathroom bill. His group was outspent by a margin of more than six to one. According to campaign disclosures filed with the Alaska Public Offices Commission, Prop. 1 attracted more money than any other item on the Anchorage ballot by far \u2014 including the mayor's race. Donations from national progressive groups poured in, including the American Civil Liberties Union, Freedom for All Americans, and Planned Parenthood of the Great Northwest and Hawaii. Bolstered by strong individual contributions, too, Fair Anchorage raised $824,000. Minnery's campaign raised about $128,004, according to financial reports, and the majority of it's donations came directly from Alaska Family Action in the last month before the election. Going forward, the organization says it will focus on electing a more conservative governor and state house lawmakers this November, in the hopes they will override local policies in Anchorage. \"We're feeling pretty positive about it and just looking forward to another opportunity to bring some common sense back to this issue,\" Minnery says. Results are expected to be certified on April 17.",

Harris is the last surviving member of the Kerner Commission.\n                \n                    \n                    Russell Contreras/AP\n                    \n                \nhide caption Former Democratic Sen. Fred Harris of Oklahoma, seen in August 2017, holds a copy of The Kerner Report, as he discusses its 50th anniversary. Harris is the last surviving member of the Kerner Commission. In 1967, over 100 cities, large and small, exploded in fire and violence, the result of decades of discrimination against black populations in places like Cleveland, Nashville, Boston and Newark. The biggest riot at the time was in Detroit. After five days of rioting, 33 blacks and 10 whites were dead and property damage totaled more than $100 million. Unnerved by the scale of Detroit's unrest, and anxious to find the root causes of the violence, President Lyndon Johnson announced to the nation that he'd convened a new commission, the National Advisory Commission on Civil Disorders. The 11-person group would be headed by Otto Kerner, then governor of Illinois. Its charge: to discover what happened, why it happened and how to prevent it from happening again. The Commission's members (all male and all white, except for NAACP head Roy Wilkins and Sen. Edward Brooke, R-Mass.) took field trips to several trouble spots. They interviewed residents and consulted with their own team of demographers and analysts to understand the depths of the effects of segregation and other forms of discrimination. (During one such visit, a man told Commission members Fred Harris, then a senator from Oklahoma and his trip partner New York Mayor John Lindsay, he saw more white people in the Mississippi hometown he'd fled than his adopted city of Milwaukee. His life was that segregated.) Warnings in a best-seller The conclusions were dire. Institutional and systemic racism were responsible for many of the ills that beset black America, the report said. The segregated housing, subpar public schools and aggressive policing of black and brown communities could all be traced back to the second-class treatment of America's darker citizens. The nation, the report famously warned, was \"moving toward two societies, one black, one white--separate and unequal.\" The Commission's report was published as a paperback, and became a national best-seller. Virtually no one referred to it by its formal name Report of the National Advisory Commission on Civil Disorders; it simply became the Kerner Report. And while some progress has been made since the report was initially released, a lot of things have gotten worse. A new study that builds on the Kerner Report's work was released this week. Healing Our Divided Society: Investing in America Fifty Years After the Kerner Report was co-edited by Fred Harris (the sole surviving member of the original Commission) and Alan Curtis, CEO of the Milton Eisenhower Foundation. It notes that poverty has increased and so has the inequality gap between white America and Americans who are black, brown and Native American. The gains children of color made when efforts continued to desegregate schools in the 60s began to reverse by 1988. Court decisions that loosened oversight of previously de facto segregated schools resulted in a huge change: In 1988, almost half of all students of color went to majority-white schools. Today that number has plummeted to 20 percent. Poverty is such a problem, the study concluded, that if it is not mitigated, America's very democracy is threatened. \"I was 37 when I served on the (Kerner) Commission,\" Harris told NPR. \"Whoever thought that 50 years later, we'd still be talking about the same things? That's kinda sad.\" Kerner's continued relevance Julian E. Zelizer, a history professor at Princeton who has written extensively on the Kerner Commission, said the original report remains germane. \"In terms of criminal justice and the way race affects it, I think the findings are so relevant. You could almost take portions of the report, adjust them, obviously, to contemporary times, but they'd still resonate with what we're dealing with today.\" Zelizer says Johnson wasn't even sure he wanted to convene a panel to study racial unrest. That would be tricky even in the best of times, and those times weren't that. \"He's very fearful from the start that the Commission would end up blaming him,\" Zelizer explained. \"And at the same time, they'll say you have to do things that Congress, he knows, will never accept, and he would look bad.\" After his Herculean effort to pass the Civil Rights Act and the Voting Rights Act, could the architect of The Great Society be remembered instead as the president who bungled race? That possibility was very much on the president's mind. Johnson's trepidation \u2014 and his annoyance that his Great Society programs were not credited in the report (members said they didn't want to politicize their findings) \u2014 led him to ignore the Kerner Commission. There was no ceremonial handover of the report in the Oval Office or elsewhere, no handshakes, no thank yous. \"He refused to meet with us to receive our report,\" Harris confirms. \"And that's particularly sad to me because President Johnson did more against racism and poverty than any president before or since.\" No love from the White House Peniel Joseph, a University of Texas historian, says Johnson was in a tight spot. The Vietnam war was not going well. Martin Luther King Jr. was preparing to begin several marches that would highlight the poverty of black America. And politicians in his own Democratic Party, such as Minnesota Sen. Eugene McCarthy and, later former Attorney General Robert Kennedy, were making noises about challenging him for the presidency. He felt hounded on all sides. \"He was being criticized from his left by people like Dr. King, who was saying all the money he was spending in Vietnam should be spent on antipoverty efforts and racial justice efforts,\" Joseph says. \"And on his right,\" he continued, \"He was being criticized by conservatives who supported the war effort, but rejected the Great Society, and who felt as if the Great Society was justifying law and disorder.\" So the Kerner Report was put aside, and would soon be eclipsed by the tsunami of historical events that followed that year: King's assassination in April, Robert Kennedy's in June, the train wreck that was the Democratic National Convention in August, with its Chicago street protests and unhinged police violence. Richard Nixon's election campaign that fall centered on a law-and-order platform. But landmark anniversaries have a way of focusing people's attention. The date, the continued attention on problems the Kerner Report focused on (the militarization of police departments, for instance) and the new study may renew people's interest. And maybe enlightened self-interest will help. \"Racial and ethnic inequality is still with us,\" Fred Harris told the Washington Post. \"What's happening in the country is bad for all of us. Doing something about it is good for all of us.\"",

They are touring the country to talk to evangelicals about the midterm elections. On a recent evening in Houston, under the heavy branches of live oak trees, Doug Pagitt stood before a couple dozen people gathered on blue folding chairs on the Rice University campus. \"You've heard it said that to be a true Christian, you must vote like a Republican,\" he said. \"But we are here to be reminded that just ain't so.\" You have heard it said, 'America First,' but we are here to be reminded to 'seek first the Kingdom of God,' on behalf of all those everywhere in the world. Doug Pagitt Pagitt, 52, describes himself as a progressive evangelical. He pastors a church in Minneapolis and has been traveling the country by bus, preaching a message that juxtaposes Trump campaign slogans against quotes from the Bible. \"You have heard it said, 'America First,' but we are here to be reminded to 'seek first the Kingdom of God,' on behalf of all those everywhere in the world,\" he said, quoting the words of Jesus in the Gospel of Matthew. Pagitt's organization, Vote Common Good, is focusing on evangelicals and other Christian voters who feel out of place in President Trump's Republican Party. It's an uphill battle, given that more than 8 in 10 white evangelical voters supported Trump in 2016. Pagitt said the group has just under $1 million in private donations. They're touring the country ahead of the midterms, visiting more than 30 congressional districts that were chosen in part based on their religious makeup. At an event in San Antonio, Tracy Goodrich, 48, said she and her husband quietly left their evangelical church soon after the election.

Goodrich, who is still home schooling two of her four children, said she voted for Republicans until 2016. But she doesn't like the way Trump talks about vulnerable people, she said, like immigrants, women and the poor. Goodrich said many of her evangelical friends initially opposed Trump until it became clear he would be the Republican nominee. \"Literally all of a sudden, Donald Trump \u2014 we couldn't see anything wrong with Donald Trump. It was: Now we're blind to everything. But it was all on the abortion issue,\" she said. Goodrich describes herself as \"pro-life,\" but she said other issues, like helping the poor and helping those facing discrimination, should be just as important to Christians. Seeing the debate differently Singer Meah Pace has been traveling with the group, performing hymns like \"Amazing Grace\" at parks and churches. Pace grew up in a predominantly black Baptist church. Unlike their white evangelical counterparts, black Christians overwhelmingly vote for Democrats; Pace said people who've faced a history of disenfranchisement often see the abortion debate differently. \"When you are fighting to keep your family together; when you're fighting to keep your children safe \u2014 from criminals and from cops; when you don't know if someone's gonna pick up your r\u00e9sum\u00e9 because of your name; when you don't know how you're gonna send your kids to college \u2014 things like that, because things were set up that way to disenfranchise people,\" Pace said, \"us fighting about an issue like this is something that we feel we can leave in God's hands.\" Abortion is the key issue Doug Pagitt said the issue of abortion has come up again and again since the bus began touring in early October. He published an op-ed in USA Today this week, arguing that evangelicals should put more energy into reducing abortions than trying to criminalize them and should vote against politicians who support Trump's agenda.

Kristan Hawkins, who runs the anti-abortion-rights group Students for Life, is a former evangelical who converted to Catholicism. She said she has heard this argument before and doesn't think most conservative Christian voters will buy it because of how they view abortion. \"There are certainly a lot of issues that Christians care about when they go to vote,\" Hawkins said. \"But at the end of the day, we know there is a human rights atrocity happening inside of our country \u2014 and that atrocity is abortion.\" However the issues are framed, pollster Robert Jones of the Public Religion Research Institute said moving white evangelicals away from the GOP will be an uphill battle. \"Once you have several generations that are voting 80 percent Republican, it's less that they're doing that because of one particular issue, and more that it has become, in many ways, a kind of tribal identity that's just inextricably tied to evangelical identity,\" Jones said. \"And I think that is the tie that binds much more than any single issue.\" Vote Common Good is trying to push beyond those identities by talking to small groups of Christian voters almost daily in the weeks leading up to the midterms. Organizers say they're planning more events for the 2020 presidential cycle. Rep. Ted Lieu, the current vice chairman of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, has informally advised the group. He said he hopes they will \"help Americans understand that if they want to vote their conscience, there is a place in the Democratic Party for them.\" Lieu said Democrats could do a better job of reaching religious voters including Christians. \"Religion and faith is something that's been part of America for over two centuries,\" Lieu said. \"For one party to ignore that aspect of American life is not a good idea.\"",

            "article_content": "Rural Americans are preoccupied with the problems of opioid and drug addiction in their communities, citing it as a worry on par with concerns about local jobs and the economy, according to a new poll from NPR, the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation and the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health. \"For many years, the opioid crisis was seen as affecting only a few states \u2014 West Virginia, Kentucky and New Hampshire among others. But it never was just about those states,\" says poll co-director Robert J. Blendon, a professor of public health and health policy at Harvard. \"It's now at the same level of a very serious economic plight that people are really worried about. It affects elections, and it affects how people elected from rural areas view their priorities.\" Nearly equal proportions cited drug addiction or abuse (including opioids) and economic concerns as the biggest problems facing their local communities. Loading... Don't see the graphic above? Click here: What is the biggest problem facing you and your family? The difference between these two biggest problems was not statistically significant nationally. But rural residents of Appalachia cited drug addiction or abuse, including opioids, as the biggest problem in their communities much more frequently (41 percent) than did adults in other rural areas. Loading... Don't see the graphic above? Click here: What would you say is the biggest problem facing your local community? Optimism about the future Even as opioids and drug addiction have risen to essentially the same level of economic concerns, our poll shows clearly that rural America is far from a monolith. In fact, the poll also finds strong strains of optimism about the future in rural America. Eight in 10 rural Americans said they feel their lives are turning out either as they expected (42 percent) or better (41 percent). Only 15 percent said things are worse than they thought they would be. A majority (54 percent) said they are better off financially when compared with their parents at the same age, and a majority of rural parents (55 percent) said they think their children will be better off financially compared with themselves. \"Rural Americans are optimistic about the future, and they're also optimistic that things can be done to pull them out of the economic problems that they do face,\" says Blendon. One reason: While some rural communities are truly suffering, others are thriving, says Christopher Thornberg, founding partner of Beacon Economics. \"Let's take two kinds of rural communities. You might have a coal town and an oil town,\" Thornberg says. \"The coal town is doing terrible because coal can't compete in this era of cheap natural gas. On the other hand, because of fracking, these rural communities sitting on shale oil are booming and incomes are up dramatically.\" Akail Powell's experience bears that out. He's a 24-year-old truck driver in Grenada, Miss., a town of about 14,000 people. The town has problems with drugs, he says, but the economy is growing. \"Grenada is almost like a thriving town, starting to expand farther,\" he says. \"And bigger restaurants are being put here and in the last two years we have really developed.\" Economic and health concerns Still, when asked to name the biggest problem facing their family, as opposed to their community, people cited financial problems most frequently, followed by health or health care concerns. No other issues were mentioned by more than 5 percent of respondents. Drug or opioid addiction was cited most often as the most urgent health problem by rural Americans, followed by cancer and access to health care. Loading... Don't see the graphic above? Click here: What is the most urgent health problem currently facing your local community? An overwhelming majority nationwide said the problem of people being addicted to opioids in their local community has either gotten worse (48 percent) or remained about the same (40 percent) in the past five years. Loading... Don't see the graphic above? Click here: In the past five years, do you think the opioid addiction in your local community has _____? White rural Americans are more worried about a worsening opioid problem than are other racial and ethnic groups. They were more likely (52 percent) than African-Americans (32 percent) and Latinos (30 percent) to say the opioid problem in their local community has gotten worse over the past five years. And younger rural Americans of all races and ethnicities were significantly more likely to say they know someone who has struggled with opioid addiction: Among those 18 to 49 years old, 59 percent said they knew someone, compared with 42 percent of older rural Americans. And while there is optimism about the future, there is also plenty of negativity among rural Americans about the state of their local economy. When asked to rate the economy of the region where they live and work, a majority (55 percent) rated their local economy as only fair or poor. Rural Americans said that providing opportunities through long-term job growth and better public schooling would be the most beneficial solutions. They also reported high job satisfaction, but a significant share said they believe it will be important for them to get new training or skills to keep their job or find a better job in the future. Loading... Don't see the graphic above? Click here: Which of the following skills or training do you think you will need to keep or find a better job in your local community? Retaining young people has always been a concern in rural America. The poll finds that 4 in 10 parents (43 percent) with children over 18 said their children have moved out of their local community (not including time spent away at trade school, college or the military). An additional 16 percent said some of their children have moved and some have stayed. Of those parents whose children have moved, 61 percent said they moved to a city, followed by 17 percent who said their children moved to a suburb and 21 percent who said their children moved to another rural area. About half (52 percent) of parents whose adult children have moved away from their community said their children moved away for a job somewhere else, while 13 percent said their children had a hard time finding a good long-term job in their local community. More than one-third of younger rural Americans (36 percent) said the overall number of good jobs in their local community has increased over the past five years, compared with 25 percent of older rural Americans. A feeling of community Why do people stay? About one-third (31 percent) of respondents said it is because their family is there. Most rural Americans (81 percent) said they feel attached to their local community, and they identify its closeness as one of its biggest strengths. They also said life in a small town and being around good people are their community's biggest strengths. Loading... Don't see the graphic above? Click here: What would you say is the biggest strength of your local community? Will the problems that they do see be solved in the next five years? Half said they are confident they will be solved, but rural Americans largely see a need for outside help to solve them. Among this latter group, a majority think the government \u2014 federal, state and local \u2014 will play a major role in solving these problems. Three in 10 rural Americans who said they need outside help to solve major community problems said it will be the state that plays the greatest role. Loading... Don't see the graphic above? Click here: Which of the following groups do you think will play the greatest role in solving local problems? Overall, most rural Americans said that minority groups do not face discrimination in their local community, but there are significant exceptions. Substantial numbers said they see discrimination against certain groups: 30 percent said they think transgender people are discriminated against in their community; 29 percent said recent immigrants to the U.S. are; and 27 percent said gays and lesbians are. Significantly fewer rural Americans said that whites (9 percent), Asian-Americans (10 percent) or disabled people (12 percent) are discriminated against in their local community. Despite rural Americans' low general recognition of discrimination, rural adults belonging to minority groups are much more likely to identify discrimination against members of their own group. For example, only 21 percent of all rural Americans said they believed Latinos are generally discriminated against in their local community, yet 44 percent of Latinos living in rural areas said they did. The survey was conducted June 6-Aug. 4 among a nationally representative, probability-based telephone (cellular and landline) sample of 1,300 adults age 18 or older living in the rural United States. Interviews were conducted in English and Spanish. The margin of error for total respondents is 3.6 percentage points at the 95 percent confidence level. The sample of rural Americans is defined in this survey as adults living in areas that are not part of a metropolitan statistical area, following the definition used in the 2016 National Exit Poll, conducted by Edison Research for a consortium of ABC News, The Associated Press, CBSNews, CNN, Fox News and NBC News.",

His summer was marked by tweeting insults about black Americans who criticize him and praise for black celebrities who back him.\n                \n                    \n                    Nicholas Kamm/AFP/Getty Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption President Trump speaks at a campaign rally in Montana on Thursday. His summer was marked by tweeting insults about black Americans who criticize him and praise for black celebrities who back him. President Trump is known for throwing around insults, but his clashes with high-profile African-Americans this summer renewed focus on the language Trump uses to speak to and about black people. NPR examined Trump's Twitter feed between June 1 and Labor Day. It provided a snapshot of a president who directs venomous tirades at black public figures who bash him, while singling out black celebrities who support him for praise. During those three months, Trump tweeted almost 900 times about everything from tariffs to North Korea. Nearly 50 tweets were focused on a black person or black Americans in general, with 20 of those tweets negative in tone. Athletes and critics Trump started off his summer clashing with the Super Bowl champion Philadelphia Eagles over NFL players protesting during the national anthem. These protests have been mostly carried out by black players with a goal of bringing awareness to police brutality. Loading... In a tweet in early June, he announced he was canceling the traditional celebration for the championship team at the White House because he claimed most players were not going to show up because they disagreed with his criticism of kneeling during the anthem. Opposition to the NFL protests has become a rallying cry for Trump with his base. Critics argue he has used the issue to stoke racial divisions. In August, Trump tweeted that most of the protesting athletes can't even \"define\" what they are outraged about. This was not the only time this summer that Trump seemed to question the intelligence of notable black Americans. He repeatedly lashed out at U.S. Rep. Maxine Waters, a black Democrat from California, who has been highly critical of Trump and his policies. Loading... On Twitter, Trump called Waters an \"extraordinarily low IQ person,\" \"crazy\" and \"unhinged.\" In other tweets, Trump would also attack the intellect of former White House aide Omarosa Manigault Newman, NBA superstar LeBron James and CNN anchor Don Lemon. Trump fell out with Manigault Newman over the release of her book, Unhinged, in August, which painted a scathing portrait of his White House. He railed against Manigault Newman over the course of several days on Twitter, even calling her a dog in one tweet. \"Deepest stereotypes about race\" The dehumanizing language Trump used about Manigault Newman and other black celebrities cannot be disconnected from this country's history of racism and discrimination against black Americans, said Ian Haney Lopez, a law professor at the University of California, Berkeley. \"The language connects up with some of the deepest stereotypes about race that suffuse our culture,\" Haney Lopez said. \"All of this is really playing into this ugly sense that some people aren't really valuable as people. And again this is a set of ideas that run deeply in our society.\" Haney Lopez is the author of the book Dog Whistle Politics: How Coded Racial Appeals Have Reinvented Racism and Wrecked the Middle Class. Facing questions about Trump's disparaging tweets, White House officials have defended the president's comments. White House spokesman Hogan Gidley says the tweeted insults have nothing to do with race. \"By now, everyone understands President Trump is a counter-puncher and will defend himself against countless, unfounded, ridiculous attacks,\" Gidley said in a statement. One striking aspect of Trump's political rhetoric is that much of it seems to be a throwback to the 1980s and 1990s. His go-to phrases for endorsing Republican candidates for midterm elections are \"tough on crime\" and \"strong on crime\" \u2014 he used the phrases more than 30 times this summer. To draw a contrast, he typically calls Democrats \"weak\" on crime or the border. Loading... But, in the case of Stacey Abrams, the Democratic candidate for governor of Georgia, Trump deviated from this pattern. He did not use her name, but he described Abrams, who is African-American, as \"crime loving.\" Asked about the decision to aim such charged language at Abrams, Gidley said the tweet was not really specifically aimed at Abrams, but was meant to address Democrats generally. But Haney Lopez says Trump does not deserve the benefit of the doubt on these matters, especially when he was an outspoken promoter of false allegations that former President Barack Obama was not born in the United States. \"The presumption should be that Trump is as he has been for months, as he has been since his birther campaign, that Trump is intentionally engaging in racially provocative language,\" Haney Lopez said. \"And if he wants to suggest that he's not, the burden of proof should be on him and his administration.\" Trump's defenders often point to the fact that he attacks people of all races on his Twitter feed as evidence that he is not acting out of animus against black people. Over the past three months, Trump has lashed out at a number of people who have aggrieved him \u2014 black and white. One of his most common put-downs still happens to be \"crooked,\" the derogatory nickname he assigned his former presidential rival, Hillary Clinton. He referred to Clinton with that insult 26 times. \"Privately, I've seen a man who really treats everybody the same regardless of color, and that's the God honest truth,\" said Mark Burns, a black pastor who is a member of Trump's informal evangelical advisory panel. \"What I've discovered is he is an equal opportunist when it comes to really rebutting any attacks that he might have received.\" \"SPECTACULAR\" Trump does have kind words for those black politicians whom he views as on his team, including John James, a black Republican Senate candidate in Michigan. Loading... James was the only candidate this summer whom Trump called \"spectacular\" in all caps in his endorsement tweet, which also mentioned that James was an African-American leader. Trump also seems to relish highlighting any black celebrity who voices support for him. He bragged on Twitter about receiving compliments from rapper Kanye West, football legend Jim Brown and golfer Tiger Woods. Loading... Many of these tweets highlighting black celebrities that back Trump also mentioned that black unemployment has fallen to record lows since Trump became president. Trump constantly mentions the African-American unemployment numbers when making the case for the success of his tenure so far. The ubiquitous talk of black unemployment is a way to shield Trump from accusations of racism, says Clarence Lusane, chair of the political science department at Howard University. \"The target is really white voters who are going to be uncomfortable with thinking that they're voting for an overtly racist president,\" Lusane said. \"When Trump talks about black unemployment he is not talking to black people. He's talking to the white voters that they don't want to scare away as they head into the 2020 election.\" Trump's rhetoric this summer does not seem to have helped his standing with the black community. An ABC News/Washington Post poll released in late August found Trump's approval rating with African-Americans was just 3 percent. NPR intern Libby Barry contributed research to this story.",

Updated at 10:55 p.m. ET Supreme Court nominee Judge Brett Kavanaugh weathered another long day of questions from the Senate Judiciary Committee Thursday. He was pressed once again for his views on presidential power. Sen. Dick Durbin, D-Ill., sought a promise from Kavanaugh that he would be willing to serve as a check on the president who nominated him. \"Give us some reassurance about your commitment to the democratic institutions in this country, in the face of a president who seems prepared to cast them aside,\" Durbin said. \"Whether it's voter suppression, the role of the media \u2014 case after case, we hear this president willing to walk away from the rule of law in this country.\" \"No one is above the law,\" Kavanaugh replied. \"I've made clear in my writings that a court order that requires a president to do something or prohibits a president from doing something under the Constitution or laws of the United States is the final word in our system.\" Sen. Mazie Hirono, D-Hawaii, complained that the Supreme Court had been unduly deferential to President Trump this summer when it upheld his travel ban, despite what she called the administration's \"obviously bogus\" justification. She pressed Kavanaugh on when the high court should question a president's national security claims. \"National security is not a blank check for the president,\" Kavanaugh said, pointing to a number of cases in which the court had overruled the administration. \"Even in the context of wartime, the courts are not silenced. Civil liberties are not silent.\" Kavanaugh told lawmakers he is so committed to judicial independence, he stopped voting in national elections after he became a judge. Sen. Kamala Harris, D-Calif., again asked Kavanaugh if he'd ever spoken with anyone at the law firm of Trump's personal attorney Marc Kasowitz about special counsel Robert Mueller's investigation, renewing a line of questioning she'd opened Wednesday night. \"The answer is no,\" Kavanaugh said. As he's done throughout the hearing, Kavanaugh declined to answer a series of questions from Harris about issues that might come before the high court, including abortion, same-sex marriage and immigration. The White House issued a statement late Thursday praising Kavanaugh. \"Through long hours and days of questioning, Judge Kavanaugh consistently reinforced his firm belief in the bedrock principles of judicial independence and the rule of law,\" deputy press secretary Raj Shah said in the statement. Kavanaugh was asked repeatedly during the televised hearing about whether he would support opening the Supreme Court to TV cameras. He promised to keep an open mind, but said he would also want to consider the views of the eight current justices. Thursday's session began with Democrats on the committee in open revolt over the handling of documents from Kavanaugh's tenure in the George W. Bush White House. Some documents have been withheld altogether. Others have been provided to the committee on \"confidential\" terms, meaning senators can see them but they can't be made public. Democrats object that the confidential label has been applied to a wide swath of records, many of which contain no personal or sensitive information. They also complain that classification decisions were made by former President Bush's attorney, William Burck, a former deputy of Kavanaugh's. Sen. Cory Booker, D-N.J., released some of the confidential documents Thursday morning. Hirono also released \"confidential\" documents, drawing a stern rebuke from Sen. John Cornyn, R-Texas, who called them \"irresponsible and outrageous.\" \"This is no different from the senator deciding to release classified information,\" Cornyn said Thursday morning. \"No senator deserves to sit on this committee, or serve in the Senate, in my view, if they decide to be a law unto themselves and willingly flout the rules of the Senate and the determination of confidentiality and classification.\" Read the documents released by Sen. Hirono here and the documents released by Sen. Leahy here. For all the theatrics on both sides, the debate over documents fizzled by Thursday afternoon, once it became clear their release had been authorized by Bush's attorney overnight. \"We cleared the documents last night shortly after Senator Booker's staff asked us to,\" Burck said in a statement. \"In fact, we have said yes to every request made by the Senate Democrats to make documents public.\" And an aide to Grassley told NPR that \"counsels for the senators who requested waivers last night/this morning for particular documents were notified that their requests had been honored beginning at around 3:50 this morning.\" But a spokesperson for Hirono said the senator was not informed that the documents released by her office Thursday morning had been approved to be made public. It is not clear whether Booker knew the documents he released had already been approved before his statements Thursday morning at the beginning of the hearing \u2014 when he said that his decision to release the documents was a form of civil disobedience and that he was aware he was risking expulsion from the Senate for making the documents public. \"Cory said this morning that he was releasing committee confidential documents, and that's exactly what he's done,\" Booker spokeswoman Kristin Lynch said in an email to NPR. \"Last night, he was admonished by Republicans for breaking the rules when he read from committee confidential documents. Cory and Senate Democrats were able to shame the committee into agreeing to make last night's documents publicly available, and Cory publicly released those documents as well as other committee confidential documents today. And he'll keep releasing them because Republicans are hiding Brett Kavanaugh's record from the American people.\" Sen. Cory Booker, D-N.J. \u2014 sitting next to Sen.

In a 2002 email, Kavanaugh wrote that security procedures adopted in the wake of the Sept. 11 attacks should ultimately be race-neutral, though he acknowledged that developing such procedures could take time. Others in the White House suggested racial profiling might be legally justified if it enhanced security. In a 2001 email, Kavanaugh addressed a legal challenge to an affirmative action program within the Department of Transportation. \"The fundamental problem in this case is that these DOT regulations use a lot of legalisms and disguises to mask what in reality is a naked racial set-aside,\" he wrote. Kavanaugh had sidestepped questions from Booker on Wednesday night about the circumstances in which government can and cannot use race-conscious measures to address past discrimination. He conceded that hopes he expressed nearly two decades ago for a color-blind society have not been fulfilled. \"We see on an all-too-common basis that racism still exists in the United States of America,\" Kavanaugh said. \"Our long march to racial equality is not over.\" Separately, The New York Times reported on leaked emails from the \"confidential\" file. One is an email drafted by Kavanaugh in 2003, in which he questioned whether the Supreme Court's 1973 Roe v. Wade decision legalizing abortion should be described as \"settled law of the land.\" Pressed on that email by Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., on Thursday, Kavanaugh explained he was simply summarizing views of legal scholars and not offering his own view. On Wednesday, Kavanaugh said he understands the weight that many people attach to Roe. But he declined to say whether that case was properly decided. Throughout the hearing, Kavanaugh has avoided commenting on Trump's behavior, despite urging from Senate Democrats. \"I'm not going to get within three zip codes of a political controversy,\" he said Thursday, when Sen. Richard Blumenthal, D-Conn., asked him about Trump's attacks on judges, including Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg. \"I've spoken about my respect and appreciation for the eight justices on the Supreme Court,\" Kavanaugh said. \"I know they're all dedicated public servants who have given a great deal to this country.\" Barring surprises, Kavanaugh appears likely to win confirmation in time to take his place alongside those eight justices when the Supreme Court begins its fall term next month.

            "article_content": "White House counsel Don McGahn (left) reportedly spent 30 hours talking to the team investigating Russian interference in U.S. elections. Another White House special counsel, John Dean, became a witness against President Richard Nixon 45 years ago.\n                \n                    \n                    Jacquelyn Martin/AP and AP\n                    \n                \nhide caption White House counsel Don McGahn (left) reportedly spent 30 hours talking to the team investigating Russian interference in U.S. elections. Another White House special counsel, John Dean, became a witness against President Richard Nixon 45 years ago. The median age in America is roughly 37. So most of the people in this country today have no memory of events in the 1970s, much less the 1950s. But President Trump does. He has not only memories but also direct personal connections to some of the actors in those eras. And the drama of those times remains vivid to him, or at least worthy of mentioning on Twitter. The latest barrage of presidential tweets attacking independent counsel Robert Mueller has made mention of two historical figures who were household names in America a generation or two ago \u2014 names that can still raise eyebrows \u2014 and blood pressure. One is John Dean, a key figure in the exposure of President Richard Nixon's role in the Watergate scandal in the early 1970s. That scandal led to Nixon's resignation, on the brink of impeachment, in 1974. Dean was the White House counsel in 1972, when burglars were caught bugging the headquarters of the Democratic National Committee in the Watergate Hotel. The burglars were working for Nixon's re-election committee, and a cover-up of that connection was engineered within the White House. Watergate and the limits of a White House counsel Dean initially took part in that cover-up but eventually decided to tell the truth, both to independent prosecutors and to a special Senate committee that held televised hearings in the summer of 1973. (He still had to serve a jail term for his earlier role.) He told the committee that he had warned Nixon that \"there was a cancer growing on the presidency and if the cancer was not removed, then the president himself would be killed by it.\" That was on Trump's mind this past weekend because the current White House counsel, Don McGahn, has reportedly spent 30 hours talking to Mueller's team, which is investigating obstruction of justice and possible collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia. Trump was at pains to say McGahn had not become a witness against the president \u2014 as Dean had 45 years ago. \"The failing @nytimes wrote a Fake piece today implying that because White House Councel Don McGahn was giving hours of testimony to the Special Councel, he must be a John Dean type 'RAT,' \" he tweeted. The failing @nytimes wrote a Fake piece today implying that because White House Councel Don McGahn was giving hours of testimony to the Special Councel, he must be a John Dean type \u201cRAT.\u201d But I allowed him and all others to testify - I didn\u2019t have to. I have nothing to hide...... Dean, still alive and well at 79, was a guest on NPR's All Things Considered on Monday and said he had not been shocked when Trump called him a rat. He said it struck him as a \"fairly normal sort of invective from the president,\" who in another tweet referred to Mueller's investigators as \"thugs.\" Dean added that the president might not know everything that McGahn told the investigators over those 30 hours of interviews. \"I think he probably provided timelines,\" Dean said, for events in the campaign and in the White House. Dean called this \"just invaluable testimony.\" Reporting of McGahn's cooperation with Mueller \u2014 and the specific fact that McGahn had sat for 30 hours of interviews with Mueller's team \u2014 appeared Saturday in The New York Times. That story said McGahn and his personal attorney had begun to fear that he was being made the \"fall guy\" if Trump or others in the White House were found to have broken any laws. A similar suspicion has long been seen as part of Dean's motivation in turning against Nixon 45 years ago. Dean on Monday told NPR's Ailsa Chang that McGahn's own personal lawyer was \"smart in making [McGahn] a witness and not a target\" in Mueller's overall investigation. \"That was in McGahn's interest, because he thought he was being set up to be a target.\" Beyond that, Dean noted, the law requires the White House counsel to represent the office of the president as a government employee \u2014 not to represent the president as a personal client: \"If McGahn is aware of any wrongdoing on the president's part, he has to really report that up and out under the standard code of professional conduct that now exists.\" A 1950s spectacle with a personal tie to Trump Trump's Sunday morning Twitter storm also included another, stranger historical reference. It urged Americans to \"study Joseph McCarthy,\" suggesting that Mueller's probe was so unfair and out of bounds that it made the notorious 1950s Communist hunter \"look like a baby.\" Anyone familiar with McCarthy's history would have to smile at that image. Although the youngest member of the U.S. Senate when he first took the oath in 1947 at age 38, his receding hairline and perpetual five o'clock shadow made him look much older. McCarthy's first years in office attracted little attention outside his home state of Wisconsin. But in February 1950, he gave a speech in Wheeling, W.Va., alleging that he had a list of actual communists working in the U.S. State Department. Sen. Joseph McCarthy listens to his attorney, Roy Cohn, during the televised Army-McCarthy hearings in 1954. The series of hearings badly damaged the senator's image and led to a vote of censure by the Senate.\n                \n                    \n                    Bettmann Archive/Getty IMages\n                    \n                \nhide caption Sen. Joseph McCarthy listens to his attorney, Roy Cohn, during the televised Army-McCarthy hearings in 1954. The series of hearings badly damaged the senator's image and led to a vote of censure by the Senate. The charge created a sensation in the atmosphere of the time, when war was breaking out in Korea and powerful Communist regimes ruled China and the Soviet Union. McCarthy tapped into the fear and confusion of the Cold War era and greatly contributed to both. Supporters even wanted Dwight Eisenhower to put McCarthy on the national ticket in 1952 (Eisenhower instead chose Nixon, then a senator from California). While denied a shot at the vice presidency, McCarthy used his investigative powers as a subcommittee chairman to haul a procession of witnesses before the cameras on Capitol Hill. There they were grilled relentlessly by McCarthy or his principal counsel, Roy Cohn. Their abusive style eventually proved their undoing when they took on the U.S. Army over the promotion of a major they found suspicious. The televised Army-McCarthy hearings in 1954 badly damaged the senator's image and led to a vote of censure by the U.S. Senate. Humiliated, he gradually withdrew from the Senate and entered a hospital in Washington, where he died in 1957 at the age of 48. Years later, when the full records of McCarthy's committee were released, Sens. Susan Collins, R-Maine, and Carl Levin, D-Mich., wrote this in the preface: \"Senator McCarthy's zeal to uncover subversion and espionage led to disturbing excesses. His browbeating tactics destroyed careers of people who were not involved in the infiltration of our government. ... These hearings are a part of our national past that we can neither afford to forget nor permit to reoccur.\" Trump was only 10 when McCarthy died. But he has a personal connection to him through Roy Cohn, who returned to New York City and became a legendary paladin for powerful politicians, mob bosses, sports figures and entertainers. Trump and Cohn met at a Manhattan nightclub in 1973, when Trump and his father, Fred, were being sued by the federal government for racial discrimination in their rental units. Cohn advised the Trumps to defy the government and defended them in court. The case eventually settled with no admission of guilt. Trump would later describe Cohn not only as his attorney but also as a mentor. One of Cohn's proteges, Roger Stone, would become a confidant and sometime aide to Trump. Stone had worked for the Nixon re-election effort back in 1972 as an opposition researcher and operative \u2014 sometimes described as a \"dirty trickster,\" although he was not among those prosecuted in the Watergate era. He later set up a lobbying firm in Washington with Paul Manafort, who would be Trump's campaign chairman for several months in 2016. Cohn's ultra-aggressive lawyering eventually led to his disbarment in 1986 for unethical conduct. He died later that year of complications of AIDS (insisting in public that he was suffering from liver cancer). But 30 years later, experiencing frustrations as he moved into the White House, Trump was still missing his mouthpiece and mentor and reportedly asking his inner circle: \"Where's my Roy Cohn?\" Trump has since relied on a succession of personal lawyers \u2014 among them John Dowd, Ty Cobb, and now Rudy Giuliani \u2014 who are not likely to make him forget Roy Cohn. And any thought that his White House counsel, McGahn, was filling that role would now seem ill-conceived.",

Afro-Brazilian culture is so central to Brazil's port city of Salvador that the city has earned the nickname Roma Negra, or \"Black Rome.\" The nickname resonates with Brazilians who recognize Salvador as a black cultural and intellectual capital \u2014 a place where city and culture are as deeply intertwined as Christianity is with Rome. Afro-Brazilian drummers, snack vendors and visual artists hum through Salvador's streets and plazas. These cultural fixtures are also small businesses \u2014 and their challenges are emblematic of those shared nationwide by black Brazilians in business. Souvenir salesman Paulo Costa wants to expand, he says, but \"it's really hard. No one makes this investment.\" Black Brazilians make up the majority \u2014 54.9 percent \u2014 of Brazil's population, and a higher majority among Brazil's poorest. (Many Brazilians are mixed-race and define themselves by a wide range of skin colors. Officially, black Brazilians include those who self-identify in the census as preto \u2014 black \u2014 or pardo, often translated as brown or mixed-race). On average, black Brazilians earn just over half as much as whites. The wage gap can be higher for black Brazilians with a college degree than for those without. And black Brazilians are not well represented in the upper echelons of business, accounting for around 30 percent of directors of companies with two or more people and around 5 percent of directors of the country's largest 500 companies. \"The data points to structural barriers to black Brazilians advancing in the labor market, including racial prejudice,\" says Alexandre Loloian, an economist with Seade, a S\u00e3o Paulo statistics bureau. Paulo Rog\u00e9rio Nunes is a cofounder of Dend\u00ea Valley, a consultancy and startup accelerator in Salvador.\n                \n                    \n                    Catherine Osborn/NPR\n                    \n                \nhide caption Paulo Rog\u00e9rio Nunes is a cofounder of Dend\u00ea Valley, a consultancy and startup accelerator in Salvador. Slavery, in practice for more than 350 years, lasted in Brazil until 1888, later than anywhere else in the Americas. Only within the last six years did Brazil begin requiring affirmative action policies in public universities and government bodies, which are now required to accept quotas of black applicants. \"No one likes to say it out loud, but Brazil is still all too comfortable with the idea of slave labor,\" says Loloian. But more and more young Afro-Brazilian entrepreneurs have been starting new businesses promoting their identity \u2014 and they are receiving support. Salvador, the capital of the northeastern state of Bahia, has become a hub for Brazilians trying to reduce the racial wealth gap. A strategy known as \"black money\" is coaxing resources toward black-owned businesses, with the idea that consumer and funder preference for these companies strengthens the black community as a whole. \"This strategy has been around since the 19th century, when some black Brazilians would team up to buy others' freedom,\" explains Paulo Rog\u00e9rio Nunes, a co-founder of a Salvador startup accelerator and consultancy geared to black entrepreneurs. \"I wasn't seeing many black people on dating apps\" The accelerator that Nunes and three others co-founded has dubbed itself Dend\u00ea Valley, a reference to Silicon Valley but with a nod to dend\u00ea, palm oil, an important ingredient in Afro-Brazilian cuisine. Through its doors pass what \u00cdtala Herta, another co-founder, calls \"high-potential entrepreneurs who have been underestimated\" because \"they don't have the profile that investors are used to: white and wealthy.\" Dend\u00ea Valley prioritizes entrepreneurs who are black, women and residents of Salvador's peripheries, and trains them in order to strengthen their business plans and \"to make them more competitive when pitching investors,\" says Nunes. Demand is high: This year, 107 companies applied for the accelerator's 30 spots. Twenty-nine-year old Lorena If\u00e9's journey to Dend\u00ea Valley began, she says, in January 2017, \"when I realized I wasn't seeing many black people on dating apps\" \u2014 even though she knew that 80 percent of Salvador's population is black. If\u00e9 had just begun dating after a breakup. As the mother of a toddler, she had limited time for spontaneously meeting a partner. She also wanted to form new friendships, in part to be able to \"go out in places that are majority-white\" \u2014 bars in the city center, for example, instead of its sprawling outskirts \u2014 \"and feel safe and comfortable.\" So she started a Facebook group for black Brazilians to meet and plan social and romantic outings, naming it Afrodengo after a slang word meaning \"show of affection\" or \"loved one.\" Within a week, 5,000 people asked to join. One year, two Afrodengo marriages, and a packed online album of couple selfies later, If\u00e9 applied to Dend\u00ea Valley to develop Afrodengo into an app and business. Hers became one of the 30 companies chosen for the 2018 acceleration round, and Afrodengo now has more than 44,000 members. Sauanne Bispo do Nascimento is the founder of Go Diaspora, an agency that facilitates cultural and educational exchanges.\n\n                    \n                    Catherine Osborn/NPR\n                    \n                \nhide caption Sauanne Bispo do Nascimento is the founder of Go Diaspora, an agency that facilitates cultural and educational exchanges. Dend\u00ea Valley, which is funded by Brazilian foundations, chooses startups to support based on social impact as well as business return. L\u00edvia Suarez, 31, runs a company called La Frida Bike, catering to women from city peripheries. She has trained 200 black women and girls how to cycle. Cycling improves women's health and independence, she says, adding there is a powerful symbolism to being able to \"occupy the city\" \u2014 especially in Salvador, whose colonial architecture recalls its past as one of the largest slave ports in the Western Hemisphere. Now, every Saturday morning, a group of black women cyclists led by Suarez chattily pedals through its streets. It's a social activity on the side of money-making bike rentals and repairs, but Suarez says it is central to the company's mission. The \"major challenge\" of investment Dend\u00ea Valley's 30 startups took part in a business plan and legal boot camp in April. Several are currently considering whether to carry out a certification process to become \"B Corporations,\" signaling their transparency and social impact. Their next step, securing investment, \"remains a major challenge,\" says Dend\u00ea Valley's Nunes. He and colleagues teach founders about public credit options and funds focused on diversity, such as the Kellogg Foundation's Fundo Baob\u00e1, which has a history of funding black-owned social enterprises. They also facilitate direct introductions with potential funders. In late July, the accelerator will take 10 of its startup leaders who won a pitch competition on a trip to meet investors in S\u00e3o Paulo. They've also been invited to apply to present at next year's South by Southwest festival in Austin, Texas. Herta, who previously ran an event production company, says funding difficulties for black business owners are worsened by bureaucracy and low caps on both government and private credit lines in Brazil. \"The national development bank overwhelmingly opens its pockets for huge corporations,\" she says. \"It is a stimulus that disregards Brazil's reality and misses a chance to make the economy more dynamic.\" L\u00edvia Suarez asks a question during Dend\u00ea Valley's business boot camp for startups.\n                \n                    \n                    Catherine Osborn/NPR\n                    \n                \nhide caption L\u00edvia Suarez asks a question during Dend\u00ea Valley's business boot camp for startups. That critique of the bank is so common that its planning director and evaluation director addressed it in an op-ed in O Globo this month, writing, \"It falls to [the bank] to act in a transparent way and evaluate its contribution to development.\" The bank has announced it will test a new line of credit for small businesses this year, and it plans to launch a startup accelerator in 2019. Nunes will study the new options and work to make Dend\u00ea Valley applicants competitive, he says, but questions whether there will be \"a clear policy of affirmative action to attract more black and female entrepreneurs to participate.\" \"'Black' is something valuable\" In the meantime, Dend\u00ea Valley has teamed up with other Brazilian accelerators in S\u00e3o Paulo, Belo Horizonte and Rio de Janeiro to raise a million-dollar fund for black and working-class entrepreneurs from investors in Brazil and beyond. Conta Black, a financial technology startup in S\u00e3o Paulo that offers low-interest credit, financial education and other services, launched last year with an eye on clients in Brazil's expanding black money ecosystem. Branding focuses on \"the message that 'black' is something valuable,\" says co-founder Fernanda Le\u00f4ncio, adding that \"all types of people are encouraged to join.\" The company predicts it will more than triple its client base this year. Its founders are betting on a quality they say accompanies black and working-class Brazilians through boom and bust economic cycles: resilience. \"How would we have survived without entrepreneurship?\" says Sauanne Bispo do Nascimento, whose startup facilitates cultural and educational exchanges. Despite burglary of her offices and a loan refusal from her longtime bank, the 32-year-old has sent over 400 clients abroad and became one of 10 winners of Dend\u00ea Valley's pitch competition this year. \"I will not stop,\" she says. \"I know how competent I am, and I know how far I can go.\" Rio de Janeiro producer Valdemar Geo contributed to this story.",

There's less than a month left in the Court's term and many of the most controversial and contentious cases will be decided in the coming weeks. On Monday at 10 a.m., the Supreme Court might release opinions in a number of significant cases on this year's docket, deciding the fate of President Trump's travel ban, public sector unions and political redistricting \u2014 among other possibilities. The Court never says in advance which opinions it's releasing, and it has until the end of June to either release opinions or decide to postpone the decisions. So there's no way of knowing what, exactly, might get dropped on any given opinion day. But there are a number of closely watched and highly anticipated cases still pending. Here are a few of the big ones to watch: Masterpiece Cakeshop v. Colorado Civil Rights Commission This is the famous \"Cake Case\" \u2014 a battle over whether a bakery in Colorado can refuse to bake a wedding cake for a same-sex couple, with swirling tensions over free speech, freedom of religion and freedom from discrimination. The case stems from the state's anti-discrimination law, which prohibits companies from discriminating against customers based on their sexual orientation. (Worth noting: There is no federal law banning discrimination against gay people, and state laws vary, meaning that many bakeries could turn away gay couples without consequence.) The bakery owner argues that this is a First Amendment case: Colorado is attempting to force him to bake a cake that sends a message \u2014 support for gay marriage \u2014 that he does not believe in. The state argues that this isn't about free speech, but instead is about a refusal to serve a certain class of people. So, is a wedding cake a statement, or a service? The answer \"could have huge implications for all retailers and service providers,\" as NPR's Nina Totenberg has written. Totenberg reports that all eyes were are Justice Anthony Kennedy during oral arguments, because he's likely to be the deciding vote \u2014 and he's a noted supporter of both gay rights and free speech, which are in tension in this case. Trump v. Hawaii Days after taking office in January 2017, President Trump abruptly imposed a travel ban, blocking people from several majority-Muslim countries from visiting the U.S. His executive order led to immediate chaos at airports \u2014 and kicked off a long, complicated legal battle. The travel ban has been revised several times, and several lower courts have found those various versions illegal or unconstitutional. Still, the latest version went into effect in December. It was always destined for Supreme Court review. The state of Hawaii says that Trump's executive order exceeds his actual powers, illegally discriminates based on nationality, and violates religious freedom laws by specifically targeting Muslims \u2014 an argument based in part on Trump's statements about a \"Muslim ban.\" The administration says the president has broad powers over immigration policy and that the revised ban is appropriate and legal \u2014 and that it is based on issues of national security, not religion. Many critics have challenged the national security justifications for the ban as specious at best. But the administration says it's not the judicial branch's job to question the president's judgment on national security issues \u2014 an argument that several justices on the court seem to find compelling. Janus v. AFSCME Can public sector unions charge non-members fees to cover the costs of negotiations on their behalf? In 1977, the Supreme Court decided the answer was yes; the question is whether the 2018 court still stands behind that decision. And it's a big question. \"Because states generally require unions to bargain for and represent all workers, regardless of their membership in a union, this case is something of a dagger pointed at labor's heart,\" NPR's Nina Totenberg writes. If the previous ruling is overturned, it would be a serious blow \u2014 potentially a devastating blow \u2014 for public sector unions across the country. Unions argue that non-members benefit financial from negotiated raises, for instance, and it's fair to require them to chip in. They agree that they cannot charge non-members for political activities, just for negotiations that benefit them. But conservative critics of the policy say that everything a public-sector union does is political \u2014 for instance, a wage increase is funded by taxpayers, hence a negotiated raise for workers constitutes a policy change, hence it's political. Justice Neil Gorsuch \"is likely to be the deciding vote, given that the other justices split 4 to 4 in a similar case in 2016,\" Totenberg reports. \"That case was decided just after the death of Justice Antonin Scalia, and the balance didn't seem to change\" at oral arguments in February. Gill v. Whitford Benisek v. Lamone Decisions in these gerrymandering cases could literally reshape American politics. Gerrymandering is the practice of drawing electoral maps to give one party an advantage over another. (If you want to know how it works, The Washington Post has a 3-minute explainer.) It's not a new practice \u2014 the word was coined more than two centuries ago \u2014 but modern technology allows for ever more sophisticated slicing and dicing of the voting population. At its most extreme, gerrymandering means elections are effectively decided based on who drew the maps, rather than how voters vote. But as Jeffrey Toobin, a legal writer for The New Yorker, has noted, that's a problem that's \"easier to identify than to rectify.\" But the Supreme Court might be ready to drop some possible solutions. Gill v. Whitford centers on redistricting in Wisconsin, where Republican-drawn maps delivered a resounding victory to Republicans in terms of districts won \u2014 despite winning less than 50 percent of the votes across the state. Benisek v. Lamone is about redistricting in Maryland, where Democrats redrew the map to flip a district in favor of the Democratic party. The two cases make different legal arguments, Totenberg notes, but hearing both might also allow the court to strike down redistricting without seeming to take the side of either party. (This issue is playing out across the country, and the court is also considering a complicated case about gerrymandering in Texas \u2014 you can read more about it at SCOTUS blog.) Overall, though, if the court decides to limit gerrymandering, then Republicans would lose out in the short term, she says: \"In the last two decades, the GOP has greatly increased and entrenched its dominance in the state legislatures and Congress through the use of partisan redistricting. The GOP now has control of state legislatures in 32 states, covering 61 percent of the population, while Democrats control just 13 state legislatures, covering 28 percent of the population.\" If you want to read an unconventional defense of the status quo, the solicitor general of Utah has written a short play imagining the headache it would cause if the Supreme Court tries to require fairer redistricting maps. Husted v. A. Philip Randolph Institute In Ohio, if you're registered to vote and you don't show up on Election Day, you can get purged from the voter rolls. Under former President Obama, the Justice Department said that was illegal. Under President Trump, the Justice Department switched gears and supported Ohio's policy. Ohio emphasizes that it sends mail to voters' houses if they don't vote in multiple elections, giving them the chance to confirm their voting status and remain registered. But some frustrated Ohio residents say they never saw the notices, and that unregistered mail is not the only \u2014 or best \u2014 way to confirm a person's address. As Totenberg reports, an argument on the steps of the court got to the heart of the disagreement. Ohio's secretary of state, Jon Husted, said Ohio was making it \"easy to vote and hard to cheat.\" An Ohio mayor and military veteran said he was on active duty when he was purged from the voting rolls for not voting and not sending back the mailing. \"I came back home after defending that right [to vote], and could not exercise it because of this archaic, terrible policy,\" he said. Now the Supreme Court will weigh in. Minnesota Voters Alliance v. Mansky Another voting case focuses on the politics-free \"buffer zone\" around polling places. Totenberg notes that the Supreme Court has long upheld laws creating a campaign-free zone around polling places. This case is about what happens inside polling places. Specifically, can Minnesota require voters to hide or remove all political badges, buttons or shirts when they go to vote? Or is that violating voters' right to free speech? At oral arguments, \"the court did not indicate which way it was leaning,\" Totenberg reports. Carpenter v. United States The court is poised to decide whether police officers need a warrant to seize cell phone records, including location data. The eponymous Carpenter, Timothy Carpenter, was a cell phone thief who was busted by cell phone location data \u2014 which the government got from a wireless provider without a search warrant. The question is whether that violated the Fourth Amendment, which protects against \"unreasonable searches and seizures.\" Changing technology complicates the question, as Totenberg notes. Cell phone location data was originally hit-or-miss (Serial fans might recall the difficulties of pinpointing location based on cell towers) but they have grown more precise over time. Meanwhile encryption is making some kinds of digital data inaccessible to law enforcement even with a warrant. At oral arguments, \"a majority of the justices across ideological lines indicated they may be willing to impose new limits\" on the government's access to that data, Totenberg writes. Lozman v. City of Riviera Beach This is Fane Lozman's second case before the Supreme Court. His first asked whether his floating home was a boat or a house. (A house, the court said.) This one asks whether the City of Riviera Beach in Florida had the right to put Lozman in jail after he called local politicians corrupt. He was charged with disorderly conduct, but the charges were later dropped The city says there was \"probable cause\" to arrest him, regardless of what he was saying. Lozman says the arrest was retaliatory, and the \"probable cause\" just a excuse. \"The city argues that in the context of law enforcement, an open-ended right to sue for false arrest would be chaotic, expensive for municipalities and dangerous,\" Totenberg reported in Februrary. Lozman says if he's not allowed to challenge the arrest, it would suggest that government officials could use a minor crime \u2014 like jaywalking \u2014 as a pretense for arresting people based on the content of their protected speech. Totenberg notes that media organizations have filed a brief in the case, pointing out that journalists have been arrested for critical coverage of the government.",

            "article_content": "Behind the Stories features perspectives from the reporters, editors and producers who create NPR's content, offering insights into how and why they do what they do. For this post, we talked with National Correspondent Leila Fadel about her work on \"Muslims in America: A New Generation\" and \"How Muslims, Often Misunderstood, Are Thriving in America,\" products of a year-long reporting endeavor that aired on NPR and published in National Geographic. Tell us a little about your background and how you got to this point in your reporting career. I've long been an international correspondent, first for Knight Ridder, then McClatchy Newspapers, then The Washington Post and now NPR. I've spent most of my career in the Middle East. I covered the war in Iraq, the occupation, the drawdown of troops and what it's like to live through that. I moved to Egypt two weeks before the revolt against then President Hosni Mubarak and covered the wave of uprising across the region from Libya to Egypt to Tunisia and beyond. Now I'm back in the U.S. as a national correspondent, traveling across the country covering race and diversity for NPR. How did the collaboration with National Geographic come about? National Geographic heard I was back in the states on a fellowship with the Council on Foreign Relations and covering race and diversity in America, including Muslims, for NPR. They reached out to see if I'd be interested in writing a piece for the magazine and the collaboration was born. Why did it feel right to tell this story both in audio and in print? I was able to do two different things. In print, I told a story about the deep history of Islam in America and built characters that represented what it means to be Muslim American today and how that doesn't look one way and doesn't mean one thing. With the magic of audio, I was also able to tell stories that allowed the audience to hear directly from the people I reported on \u2014 to hear the sound of people's voices as they spoke about discrimination, triumph, fear, community organizing, being American and being Muslim. By reporting the stories as a series, I was able to introduce a range of communities to our listeners. Often Muslims, like other minority groups, are spoken about in a monolith rather than the diverse mosaic that they are. Bilqis Abdul-Qaadir coaches a clinic in Chicago.\n                \n                    \n                    Leila Fadel/NPR\n                    \n                \nhide caption Bilqis Abdul-Qaadir coaches a clinic in Chicago. How long did it take you to report this series? And how did you go about finding sources from across the U.S.? I spent nearly a year reporting this series. Reporting is a lot like a phone tree. I called Muslim leaders, innovators, trend setters, doctors, high school students, etc. to ask what was missing in the stories told about Muslim Americans, who make up an estimated 3.45 million people in this country. Then I just started visiting communities across the country to get a sense of the diversity, the challenges, the day to day life being lived. I learned so much, but, in the end, this project represents only a slice of what it is to be Muslim in America. I told so many stories, but I also met dozens more people than you see in these pieces. Those people taught me the history, the nuance, the issues of gender and race that exist in Muslim communities in America just as they exist in other communities.

The mosque serves a fast growing Latino Muslim community. In the last piece in the series, you wrote, \"In a year of reporting on Muslims across this country, I walked away knowing that there is no one story to tell, there are many stories.\" Of all the stories you encountered, how did you narrow it down to the ones that made the series? That was the most difficult part about this whole project. I wanted to profile people who weren't the same few voices that are often heard from. I wanted the pieces to be human, illuminating and honest. I ended up trying to tell an overarching story that not only got at what it's like to be Muslim in America today, but also highlighted often marginalized voices in an already marginalized religious group. In my reporting, I found that people were tired of being put in this box as villain or victim, good or bad. Often, Muslims say they are told who they are rather then asked who they are, what they care about. So I told the stories of what that looks like from the podcasters who are telling their own stories, to the community organizers trying to affect change in Chicago, to black Muslims who make up a third of American-born Muslims, but are often invisible when it comes to the stories told about Muslims in the U.S. Imam Jamil Bastress opens the barn on their Sufi commune in rural Pennsylvania.

They often pray here on Fridays. We loved the voices in \"Telling Your Own Story\". What was the thinking behind sharing those first-person perspectives? What better way to end a series about Muslims who insist on crafting their own stories than with a montage of the first-person perspectives of our listeners? We got over 200 diverse and interesting responses from across the country. What was it like reading all the answers that came in? It was like having little windows into completely different lives across the country, from think tankers in DC, to a Trump supporting teen in Missouri, to doctors in the Midwest, to comic creators and musicians. Islam is one of the, if not the, most racially and ethnically diverse faith groups in the country, and that showed in the responses. Today at 1pm EST/10am PST @LeilaFadel is doing a @reddit AMA about her story on Muslims in America\u2014get your questions ready! pic.twitter.com/eDkyIPVsxL What was your motivation for doing a Reddit AMA on the series? Were any questions particularly tough to answer? I like interacting with readers and listeners. Of course, I worried about trolling and straight-up Islamophobia, but, in actuality, people were really curious about these communities and asked questions that made me think. The hardest questions are the ones where people want to know what Muslims as a whole think or are challenged by. I answer these questions by breaking down the monolith and explaining that Muslims, Christians, Jewish people etc. don't all think one thing. They are individuals. Were you surprised by anything you learned through reporting this series? What shocked me was just how much the communities I visited seem to be flourishing at a really difficult time for Muslim Americans. Despite the anti-Muslim rhetoric, people are out there telling their own stories. They're getting into politics and fashion and music and storytelling. I also was surprised by the incredible diversity of practice and culture that exists here. I've covered the Muslim world for over a decade, and I don't think I've seen such diversity within Islam outside of the Muslim pilgrimage, Hajj, in Mecca. What do you hope readers and listeners will take from reading or listening to \"Muslims in America\"? I hope people listen to these as stories about Americans they might not know otherwise. One of the things I've been struck by since coming back to the U.S. is how we live in a country with such rich diversity of culture, religion and race but so often people feel stuck in a stereotype of their own community. After the presidential election, which was seen as so polarizing, I think a lot of people felt they didn't know their fellow citizens. I want these stories to be about knowing and understanding people not through the lens of what you think they might be, but who they actually are.

Mary Fallin vetoed a bill allowing adults to carry firearms without a license and signed a bill to let private agencies deny placing a child for adoption based on religious beliefs. Oklahoma Gov. Mary Fallin managed to anger both gun rights and LGBTQ-rights activists late Friday with two separate actions. In a rare blow to the National Rifle Association, Fallin vetoed a bill that would have loosened gun laws in the conservative state. Had it passed, SB 1212 would have allowed gun owners to carry a firearm \u2014 either open or concealed, loaded or unloaded \u2014 without a state license or permit. About a dozen states have passed similar so-called \"constitutional carry\" laws. In a second move late Friday night, she signed into law the so-called adoption bill that allows private child-placement agencies to deny the placement of a child in foster care or adoption if that placement would \"violate the agency's written religious or moral convictions or policies.\" In vetoing the gun bill, Fallin sided with law enforcement officials, who opposed the bill because of loosened training requirements, officer safety concerns and a reduced level of background checks. In a statement, the Republican governor reiterated her support for the Second Amendment and noted the bill would have scrapped the requirement for gun owners to complete a safety and training course and demonstrate \"competency\" with a pistol before carrying a gun in public. \"Again, I believe the firearms laws we currently have in place are effective, appropriate and minimal, and serve to reassure our citizens that people who are carrying handguns in this state are qualified to do so.\" Fallin noted that she had previously signed both conceal-carry and open-carry legislation. The bill had the support of state Republicans and the NRA. The NRA's chief lobbyist, Chris Cox, said in a statement that SB 1212 \"was an important piece of self-defense legislation\" and that Fallin's veto violates her promises to NRA members when she ran for re-election. \"Make no mistake, this temporary setback will be rectified when Oklahoma residents elect a new, and genuinely pro-Second Amendment governor.\" Fallin is in the final months of her second term as governor. She will not seek re-election because of term limits.

Republican state Sen. Nathan Dahm, who wrote the bill, said he was disappointed by the veto but \"not surprised.\" Dahm, who is running for Congress, said in a video on Facebook that what he called RINOs, or \"Republicans in name only,\" are \"either drinking the Kool-Aid or the swamp water.\" The current requirements, he said \"are a burden to the poor and elderly who should be afforded the right to defend themselves without having to pay the government to do so.\" Oklahoma's legislative session has ended, so any further action over the bill will have to wait until next year. In the meantime, Fallin faces outrage from LGBTQ-rights supporters over the adoption bill. JoDee Winterhof, senior vice president of policy and political affairs at the Human Rights Campaign, calls the move \"shameful\" and says the bill signs discrimination into law. In a statement, the group said law will allow private agencies to turn away \"qualified Oklahomans seeking to care for a child in need, including LGBTQ couples, interfaith couples, single parents, married couples in which one prospective parent has previously been divorced, or other parents to whom the agency has a religious objection.\" \"The bill is now the first anti-LGBTQ state bill signed into law in the country this year,\" it added. Fallin's statement on the legislation says the agencies would not be required to \"perform, assist, counsel, recommend, consent to, refer, or participate\" in a placement that would violate their written policy. \"SB 1140 allows faith-based agencies that contract with Oklahoma to continue to operate in accordance with their beliefs. In a day and time when diversity is becoming a core value to society because it will lead to more options, we should recognize its value for serving Oklahoma also because it leads to more options for loving homes to serve Oklahoma children. Other states that have declined the protection to faith-based agencies have seen these agencies close their doors, leaving less options for successful placement of children who need loving parents.\" She added that the number of children under state custody has been reduced by 21 percent during her time as governor, thanks to the cooperation of public-private agencies, \"some of which are faith-based.\" According to The Oklahoman newspaper, several Oklahoma faith leaders supported the bill, citing concern over protection of religious freedom and advocating it as \"proactive and similar to legislation that has been passed in other states like Texas, Virginia and South Dakota.\" But not all faith leaders agreed. According to the Family Equality Council, more than 100 religious leaders signed a letter urging for the bill's veto. Senate Democrats said said the move would have negative impacts, including leading to expensive litigation and harming business recruitment to the state. .@GovMaryFallin approval of SB 1140 is dissapointing; will allow adoption agencies to engage in discriminatory practices when placing children, result in expensive litigation costs, and negatively impact business recruitment in Oklahoma Americans United has threatened to sue Oklahoma over the bill, saying it has taken similar actions in other states. The bill is to take effect Nov. 1.",

Cory Booker, D-N.J., has released plan that would create pilot job guarantee programs in 15 communities where unemployment is particularly high. The 2018 midterm primary season is really heating up this week, which means it's time to think about elections \u2014 like the 2020 Democratic presidential primaries. No major candidates have declared that they're preparing a run against President Trump in two years, but whispers are building around potential candidates. A few of them have coalesced around a seriously ambitious policy idea \u2014 guaranteeing a job for every American who wants one. If enacted, such a program could be big or small; it could create massive reverberations in the private sector; and it could reshape monetary policy. One thing that is more certain is that Americans will be hearing about the idea of job guarantees for the next few years. But why now? \"My impression is it may have been the shock effect of Trump's election and the recognition that there are a host of policies, projects, that we previously didn't think were imaginable or reasonable that are being considered on the other end of the political spectrum,\" said William Darity, an economist at Duke University and a proponent of job guarantee programs. On top of that, even before Trump won the presidency, 2016 candidate Sen. Bernie Sanders also showed that voters could be won over by a \"Democratic Socialist,\" as he describes himself, who proposed massive, progressive policy overhauls that opponents also derided as being unfeasible. Sanders of Vermont is an independent who caucuses with the Democrats. Proposals like a job guarantee, Medicare for all and tuition-free college have moved from the policy fringe on the left toward the mainstream in the Democratic Party, embraced by some of those interested in challenging Trump as the party tries to give voters a clear, memorable outline of what Democrats stand for. So here's a primer on jobs guarantees \u2014 what they are, how they would work, and why we're hearing about them when unemployment is already really low. What is a jobs guarantee? A jobs guarantee program can take different forms, but the basic idea behind any program is the same, according to Darity. \"Under the conditions of a federal job guarantee, everybody would be assured of getting to work if they were seeking work. So in effect, the unemployment rate would be zero,\" said Darity. \"In an ideal world, if I lost my job in the morning, I could walk over to what we would now truly call an employment office and have new work by the afternoon.\" This separates it from a job subsidy program, he said, in which the government would help boost the number of jobs \u2014 perhaps massively so \u2014 but neither create all those jobs itself nor guarantee the jobs to those seeking one. The idea is that the job guarantee program could be what economists call an \"automatic stabilizer\" \u2014 a program that grows when the economy is in a downturn and shrinks when things are going well. But many job guarantee programs are about more than just assuring a certain quantity of jobs; they also focus on quality. Several plans \u2014 one co-designed by Darity, a proposal from New Jersey Sen. Cory Booker, another outline from Sanders \u2014 also would provide wages much higher than the federal minimum wage (currently $7.25) and benefits that are unheard of for many current low-wage workers. \"The idea is that we would then drive bad jobs out of existence,\" said Darity, \"because no one would be obligated to take those jobs since they would have a superior option.\" All of which is to say: This is a big policy idea. Implementing a job guarantee would make the federal government the employer for potentially millions \u2014 or even tens of millions \u2014 of Americans. Who is backing one? Most notably: Booker, New York Democratic Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand and Sanders. In addition, The Intercept recently reported that Massachusetts Democratic Sen. Elizabeth Warren \"has begun looking closely at\" the idea. Those aren't necessarily the only members of Congress who believe in job guarantees, but they do happen to all be oft-mentioned as 2020 Democratic presidential hopefuls. If Republicans could give $1.5 trillion in tax cuts to corporations and the wealthiest among us, why can\u2019t we invest a similar amount in a guaranteed jobs plan for regular Americans who are unemployed and willing to work to better their local community? Booker is the only one of these three with a fully fleshed-out proposal out there. His plan, unveiled late in April, would create pilot job guarantee programs in 15 communities where unemployment is particularly high. All of the jobs would give people paid family and sick leave, pay that eventually phases up to $15 an hour, and \u2014 according to Booker's website \u2014 \"health coverage like that enjoyed by Members of Congress.\" Gillibrand, Warren and fellow Democatic Sens. Kamala Harris and Jeff Merkley co-sponsored that bill. (Harris of California and Merkley of Oregon have also hinted at possible 2020 campaigns.) Sanders also has a proposal in the works. An outline provided to NPR shows the plan would be more sweeping than Booker's pilot program by establishing 2,500 job centers nationwide. Gillibrand's office tells NPR that she has a plan forthcoming, to be released in the next few weeks. Economists have also proposed having the Labor Department invest in creating jobs in the fields of child care and building infrastructure or setting up arrangements such as \"community job banks\" where jobs that can be filled immediately would be posted.

What could go wrong? \"Problem No. 1 is you're not just going to get people who have been unable to find work in the private sector for whatever reason,\" said Douglas Holtz-Eakin, a former director of the Congressional Budget Office and president of the right-leaning American Action Forum. \"You're going to get a lot of people. And a lot of people means a lot of money, so the federal budget is going to explode.\" And with that could come another problem, Holtz-Eakin said: An expensive program could mean tax hikes. And he fears those tax hikes could exacerbate the problems that a jobs guarantee is designed to help. \"You're going to actually undermine the private economy that's needed to pay those bills. So it doesn't really add up,\" he added. But beyond the cost, there are other major potential problems. One is that businesses would have to substantially raise prices in order to compensate their employees competitively with the new government jobs. It's also possible that the federal government, by investing all this money into the labor market, would crowd out the private sector, competing with businesses for labor and stifling growth. Proponents argue the policy's critics are overstating the potential dangers. For one, they say the program would at least partly pay for itself. \"I mean, if you look at all of these programs that are trying to make up for either no work or inadequate paying work as companies outsource their labor costs on us, the taxpayers,\" Booker said, \"those programs alone are worth billions and billions of dollars.\" As far as higher prices, Darity believes that is not a serious argument against a job guarantee. \"Insofar as we're maintaining an environment in which prices are lower for products because people are poorly paid, I think that that's a real ethical concern for any society,\" he said. And it may be possible to avoid the crowding-out phenomenon, economist Conor Sen recently argued (Sen, to be clear, isn't a proponent of the plans \u2014 in fact, he says he feels \"skepticism\" about the idea). His idea is to make sure the program's funding is \"countercyclical\" \u2014 that is, that it shrinks in good times and grows in bad. This sounds ... out of the ordinary as far as policies go. It is. Even for Darity, who has been a fan of job guarantees for years, it's strange to have the idea in the mainstream. \"It's a little bit surreal, because for such a long period of time, there were some of us who were talking about this, and we were roundly dismissed or ignored, and now it looks like it's something people are viewing as a credible policy option,\" he said. Wait. I keep hearing we're near \"full employment.\" Why put this plan out there now? \"Full employment\" doesn't mean that everyone who wants a job has one. It's a term economists use to describe, roughly speaking, the lowest the unemployment rate can be expected to go at any given time. Try to pull it even lower, the idea goes, and inflation would be the result. The current unemployment rate of 3.9 percent refers to the portion of people who are actively looking for work right now who can't find a job. But then, there are people working part time who want full-time work, and there are \"discouraged workers\" who have stopped looking for work. Those people are not counted in the headline unemployment rate. But count all of them, and by its broadest definition, unemployment stands at around 7.8 percent. On top of all that, in good times and bad, some people persistently just can't find work. \"Here we are at 4 percent unemployment, and we still have lots of pockets of insufficient opportunity,\" said Jared Bernstein, former chief economic adviser to Vice President Joe Biden and a senior fellow at the left-leaning Center on Budget and Policy Priorities. \"So we need a jobs program.\" That \"insufficient opportunity\" he talks about hits some groups particularly hard. \"The black unemployment rate is always twice that of the white rate,\" he added. \"And I gotta tell you, that's not written in the Good Book somewhere. That's the outcome of a persistent market failure that's very much leavened by racial discrimination.\" Onetime presidential candidate Sen.

Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., visits protesters at a March rally at the Capitol during a national walkout by students calling on Congress to act on gun violence prevention. Doesn't that make the term \"full employment\" misleading? Yeah, probably. Even at \"full employment,\" some groups are persistently far more fully employed than others. It's not that the U.S. hasn't done a major jobs program before. It has \u2014 Darity said his job guarantee plan is comparable to the employment programs of the Great Depression, like the Works Progress Administration. However, he adds that there are key distinctions. \"What's different about the job guarantee is that it is universal and it's permanent. So it's an option that would exist not only in times of massive unemployment, but it also would exist in times where the unemployment rate is lower,\" Darity said. \"But we still have large numbers of bad jobs. It's not just an emergency.\" The point, proponents say, isn't just to keep unemployment from skyrocketing during recessions; it's to correct labor market problems that persist even when unemployment is low. And even people opposed to the idea of job guarantees agree that those problems need fixing. \"The reason you don't want to be dismissive of the intent of people who propose these things is there is a set of workers out there who aren't getting jobs no matter how well the economy is performing,\" said Holtz-Eakin. So candidates are proposing this just because they think it's the right thing to do? Candidates don't tend to put out sweeping proposals because of economics alone. So why \u2014 politically \u2014 is this happening now? One explanation is that Democrats are trying to rebuild after a devastating election in 2016, which many emerged from thinking the party didn't have a clear message for what it stood for. If the party nominates a candidate in 2020 who embraces a job guarantee program, Medicare for all and tuition-free or debt-free college, it will send a clear signal that the party has embraced a progressive platform well to the left of where it has been for decades. \"I do think it is further to the left than what you've seen from Democratic politicians probably since the Obamacare debate,\" said Adam Jentleson, who served as deputy chief of staff to former Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid. \"But that represents where the party is headed and not just where the party is right now, but where Democrats think the party is likely to be in the heat of the 2020 campaign.\" A policy like a job guarantee could help win over the left wing of the party. But it's also the kind of idea that may never be much more than a campaign promise.",

Clary/AFP/Getty Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption Rapper Kanye West and President-elect Donald Trump met in 2016 at Trump Tower in New York. It was a week into the bizarre \"red pill\" Kanye West tour that the whole affair seemed to reach its zenith \u2014 or its nadir, depending on where you're sitting. Kanye completed his transmogrification into a sentient Reddit thread when he appeared on TMZ this week, parroting well-worn talking points about black-on-black crime and calling slavery in America \"a choice.\" Van Lathan of TMZ was not having it. Kanye West \u2014 rapper, music producer, clothing designer, provocateur of debatable guile \u2014 emerged from a period of relative quietude only to spend the two weeks thrusting himself into our exhausting culture wars. He shouted out the alt-right-adjacent commentator Candace Owens. He reiterated his affection for President Trump, who returned the love. He snapped a red-hat selfie. And for good measure, he wrote a verse that says black people were still on \"the Democratic plantation.\" Kanye said that he was \"free thinking\" and that he had slipped the bonds of black political conventions. The reactions to Kanye West's noisy rightward lurch perfectly illustrated some important, particular dynamics about black voting behavior \u2014 why a country with so many black conservatives continues to have so few black Republicans. When mainstream conservatives rallied around Kanye, they saw the possibility of a broader political shift: Maybe Kanye could make the GOP cool enough to upend black allegiance to the rival party. They were operating under the presumption that the arithmetic for black voting works the way it does for white voters: Conservative-leaning people vote for the GOP; liberal-leaning people vote for Democrats. Conservative publications hyped a lonely Reuters poll that showed that Trump's approval rating among black men had jumped to a slightly-less-abysmal number over the week of Kanye's MAGA-lite paroxysms. They were making a dent! But black folks seemed to largely respond to Ye with eye rolls (or the way Van Lathan did in the TMZ video above): Is this the same dude who went off script after Hurricane Katrina to say that George W. Bush didn't care about black people? Was this some kind of elaborate troll to drum up publicity for a new album? Has Kanye lost his damn mind? Ismail White, a political scientist at George Washington University, said that the response from black people to Kanye was to be expected: Trump remains less popular with black people than with any other racial group, and no other group leans as heavily Democratic in national elections as black folks. But there has long been debate about why those inclinations have remained so strong. A common explanation has been the notion of \"linked fate\" \u2014 the belief among black folks that their individual prospects are tied to a collective well-being. But White said that belief can't really explain how the powerful norm for black people to cast votes for Democrats has maintained itself over the past 50 years; norms, after all, have to be policed. What White and and three other researchers found in a recent study is that social pressure from other black people is how this Democratic norm gets policed. They found that the expectations around this norm were so powerful that simply having a black questioner ask a black respondent about their voting preferences made that respondent more likely to say they were voting for a Democratic candidate. Chryl Laird, one of the study's authors, said this is how everyone votes. We like to think of our voting choices as purely rational, but we take cues from the people around us, especially when we don't know much about a candidate or an issue. Laird said social influence and pressure partly explain why most white evangelical voters in Alabama supported Senate candidate Roy Moore last fall, even after he was accused of sexual misconduct involving minors. But she said these social effects are more intense for black people because of their history in the United States. \"Even going back to slavery, during planned slave revolts, black people would find ways to socially sanction people who informed of their plans,\" she said. \"During Reconstruction, we see instances of people who were planning to vote for the Democratic Party out of self-interest \u2014 maybe they were bribed by a white person \u2014 and those people were ostracized.\" Enforcing that solidarity has historically been a matter of life or death. But entrenched segregation today keeps black people of different ideological stripes in close social and spatial proximity to one another. It's easier to enforce collective norms, to feel affirmation or sanction from black folks, when you have black neighbors, go to black schools and mosques and churches and hair salons, when you carry around around that social history and that sense of shared stakes. Black people are surrounded by black Democrats, so they vote like black Democrats. And when they don't, they get checked. Laird pointed to an example of this from the Kanye mess: John Legend, Kanye's friend and sometimes collaborator, sent him a text message nudging him to reconsider \u2014 or just consider at all \u2014 what he was saying. (Kanye, being Kanye, posted a screenshot of that exchange to Twitter.) That nudge from John Legend, Laird says \u2014 or even Chance the Rapper's publicly distancing himself from Kanye's comments \u2014 is what enforcing those norms looks like in real time. So Kanye isn't wrong when he says there is a lot of social pressure for black people to vote Democratic. But how those pressures extend to Kanye is a different question. Laird said that the black people who are most likely to cast ballots for Republicans tend to have more attenuated social connections to black communities \u2014 like hypothetically, a famous entertainer who lives in an ultrawealthy town with a 3 percent black population. Kanye has always cast himself as an iconoclast, brave enough to flout prevailing expectations for black people. But it makes sense to ask how much his current ideological trajectory owes to his own changing personal arithmetic around social sanction and social rewards. He is not in Chicago anymore. And Kanye, as famous for his self-obsession as he is for his music, could just be looking for affirmation from the people in his current social universe who can give it to him. (That math is different for John Legend and Chance, who are more closely tied to black communities through their activism.) So where does that leave black conservatives more broadly? It's certainly not hard to find them: the capitalists who think supporting black banks can offset the effects of racism on black wealth; the social conservatives who see absent fathers as exacerbating black marginalization. There are folks who believe that black uplift lies in sufficient guile and thrift, and folks who believe that gun ownership is necessary to fend off white supremacy. There are powerful impulses coursing through institutions as disparate as black sororities and fraternities and the Nation of Islam. And it's the blackness of those philosophies that confounds the conventional left-right political continuum. Black conservatives are more likely to take as a given that racism \u2014 and anti-blackness, in particular \u2014 is a defining force in American life. If the old saw goes that a conservative is a liberal who has been mugged, then a black conservative is a conservative who has been assumed to be the mugger. To put this another way: Those black conservatives differ from mainstream conservatism because they aren't organized around white interests. Black conservatives get black people whereas white conservatives who applaud Kanye for \"escaping the Democrat plantation\" are so removed from black folks that they think it makes sense to invoke the language of slavery to describe the overwhelming majority of black voters. Whiteness, demographically and ideologically, has been so central to the mainstream conservative project that bringing black conservatives into the fold and into the Republican Party \u2014 which derives almost all of its electoral support from white conservatives \u2014 wouldn't just change its racial demographics. It would effectively change the party's ideological composition, as well. Leah Wright Rigueur, a Harvard political scientist and the author of the Loneliness Of The Black Republican, said rank-and-file black Republicans often express frustration with their party's messaging and policies toward black people. They are often ignored by fellow Republicans. But they're also viewed with suspicion by other black folks. \"There's research that shows that black folks hold much more negative opinions about black Republicans than they are of white Republicans with the same views, because they feel like it's a betrayal,\" Rigueur said. And because the handful of black Republicans with higher profiles \u2014 Herman Cain, Allen West, Ben Carson, Mia Love \u2014 don't talk to or about other black people with any particular warmth or facility, it adds to the sense that their primary role is to be the Republican Party's \"black friend.\" And so the very things that endear figures like Kanye to Republicans \u2014 his willingness to troll black people, to proclaim concerns about race obsolete, to embrace white conservatives \u2014 are the very same things that ignite black people's distrust of figures like Kanye. And it's the thing that both Kanye and Republicans who see him as a potential evangelist to black folks keep missing: You can't break bread if you're not invited to the cookout.",

Clary/AFP/Getty Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption With two new songs, Kanye West shows his affinity for President Trump and the art of the troll. Sometimes, good music is not enough. Not even for Kanye West, the musical genius and G.O.O.D. Music mogul who stooped, and fell, to cretinous levels in the eyes of many fans this week. What a week it's been, too. America's Dad was convicted in a court of law, and we learned just how nasty Nas and Kelis' former marriage may have been after she alleged being physically and mentally abused by him in a new interview. When the unmasking of heroes and villains happens all at once, it can be hard to distinguish which is which. It's the kind of inherent contradiction that lines up perfectly with Kanye's Gemini sensibilities. His latest attention-grabber is a new song uploaded to kanyewest.com Friday night. Titled \"Lift Yourself,\" it comes complete with one of his signature sped-up soul samples \u2014 identified as the 1973 song \"Lift\" by Amnesty \u2014 which dissolves into a bare-bones dance house beat before the big reveal. \"This next verse though, these bars,\" he yells, before proceeding to doo-doo all over the track in figurative fashion: \"Whoopity scoop / scoop dee dee whoop / whoopty scoopty poop,\" 'Ye raps, spitting what amounts to straight gibberish. It's a classic head fake from the artist who's prided himself in playing the troll all week long. If there's a proclamation of personal liberty buried somewhere beneath all Kanye's B.S., count yourself as collateral damage in his political provocation. Surely, you've caught snatches from his Twitter highlight reel: the scrolling mix of self-promotion (\"You would love a pair of Yeezys. Don't play yourself.\"), the dime-store philosophy (\"get past the past\"), the political contrarianism (\"You don't have to agree with trump but the mob can't make me not love him. We are both dragon energy.\"), Ye's praise of conservative black pundit and Black Lives Matter denigrator Candace Owens (\"I love the way Candace Owens thinks\") and the red MAGA hat selfie that made him an overnight darling of the alt-right. It amounts to what many have rightly interpreted as a denial of systemic racism, couched in free-thought rhetoric. But political leverage in the electoral sense is not Kanye's primary motive \u2014 it's access to an absolute power and privilege that black boys from the south side of Chicago aren't blessed with at birth. That hasn't stopped him from following the blueprint of a long line of men who've used capital to compromise our national conscience. But his latest inspiration comes straight from the playbook of the Commander-in-Chief. Call it trolling for clout, on a hundred thousand trillion. Late Friday night, L.A. radio station Power 106 premiered another new song from Kanye, featuring T.I., appropriately titled \"Ye Vs. The People.\" The song finds the two of them trading bars back and forth, as Kanye tries to convince T.I. there's a mastermind strategy behind his sunken-place politics. \"I know Obama was heaven-sent / But ever since Trump won it proved that I could be President,\" he raps. When T.I. attempts to reason with him, as the voice of the people, Kanye responds. \"You just readin' the headlines, you don't see the fine print/ You on some choosin'-side s***, I'm on some unified s***.\" T.I. fires back: \"It's bigger than your selfish agenda / Your election ain't gon' stop police from murdering n*****.\" Ye then follows up with an attempt to explain his MAGA hat selfie. \"Bruh, I never ever stopped fightin' for the people / Actually wearin' the hat'll show people that we're equal.\" And later: \"See that's the problem with this damn nation / All blacks gotta be Democrats, we ain't made it off the plantation.\" It's a flimsy equivalency at best \u2014 as if Trump's party affiliation is the biggest point of concern for critics within the black community. Kanye isn't the only voice in hip-hop to cast metaphorical votes against his racial self-interest, unwittingly or not. To be clear, hip-hop shares some complicity in the rise of the Trump mythology. As Doreen St. Felix points out in The New Yorker, rappers galore \u2013 from '90s-era Raekwon the Chef to Lil Wayne \u2014 referenced The Donald as a symbol of wealth long before he became the alt-right's candidate of choice. The tune only changed to \"F*** Donald Trump,\" as YG's 2016 protest anthem goes, when Trump laid bare his populist agenda. Contrary to prevailing stereotypes, black folks are equally prone to the pull-yourself-up-by-your-bootstraps myth that masquerades today as law-of-attraction optimism. It's partly why traditional conservative values have such strong grounding in the black community. The idea of rising above one's circumstances is as African-American as sweet potato pie. \"Hopped off the Amistad and made 'I'm A God,' \" Kanye raps in a recent sampling of new music for TMZ. It's the kind of line that captures his penchant for the paradoxical, but a deeper reading suggests 'Ye sees himself as having transcended systemic racism and the vestiges of the Transatlantic Slave Trade. This isn't new age optimism; it's narcissism. A direct reflection of the ideology he espouses via Twitter, the negative impact is likely to trickle down to Kanye's black fanbase through regressive economic policies rationalized by such logic. Plenty of people have attempted to call him out \u2014 from Ebro of Hot 97 to friend and former G.O.O.D. Music signee John Legend. Another proteg\u00e9 and Windy City homie, Chance the Rapper, got caught in the crossfire after coming to Kanye's defense: \"Black people don't have to be Democrats,\" he tweeted. The rapper, whose father worked as an aide to Barack Obama when he was an Illinois senator, quickly came to his senses after President Trump leaped at the chance to use him as a pawn in the effort to discredit his own critics. \"Kanye West has performed a great service to the Black community,\" Trump tweeted, while paying homage to Chance and Dr. Darrell Scott \u2014 the black pastor on Trump's early transition team who falsely claimed Chicago gang leaders would \"lower the body\" in exchange for federally-funded social programs \u2014 in the same sentence. \"I'd never support anyone who has made a career of hatred, racism and discrimination,\" Chance apologized in a Twitter post Friday, admitting his original post was a \"deflection\" from the real issue. \"I'd never support someone who'd talk about Chicago as if it's hell on earth and then take steps to make life harder here for the most disenfranchised among us.\" Kanye, on the other hand, sees himself as a college dropout who bucked the system and graduated to fortune and fame. After being on the bad side of two past presidents \u2013 from Republican George Bush, who blamed Kanye for the worst moment of his presidency, to Democrat Barack Obama, who labeled him a \"jackass\" \u2014 Kanye has found a kindred spirit in fellow Gemini and fire-breathing dragon Trump. Among Kanye's last tweets before the weekend began was a bold-faced admittance of his own cluelessness when it comes to party politics. \"I haven't done enough research on conservatives to call myself or be called one,\" he tweeted Friday. \"I'm just refusing to be enslaved by monolithic thought.\" Black Twitter has its own hot takes. One popular meme finds George Bush turning the tables on the rapper who notoriously criticized him during failed disaster recovery efforts following Hurricane Katrina. \"Kanye West doesn't care about black people,\" it reads in a comical twist of fate. History may be a better judge, but for now the joke's on us.",

            "article_content": "Credit:  AP Updated at 3:08 p.m. ET After five hours of testimony before a joint session of two Senate committees on Tuesday, Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg returned to the Capitol for a second straight day of grilling \u2014 this time before the House. For another five hours on Wednesday, Zuckerberg took questions from the House Energy and Commerce Committee. Representatives took a generally sharp tone, pushing Zuckerberg to commit to \"yes or no\" answers and occasionally exclaiming with mock surprise when he protested that he couldn't answer. And the questions extended far beyond questions of security, privacy and data-sharing, addressing diversity at Facebook headquarters and whether the company is tacitly allowing illegal drug sales on the platform. You can watch video of the proceedings above, or on YouTube via PBS. Or, of course, read on for highlights. The congressional hearings, Zuckerberg's first, come in the wake of a scandal in which Facebook user data was sold to Cambridge Analytica, a third-party group that assisted the Trump campaign. (Cambridge Analytica says it did not use the Facebook data in its 2016 election work.) Zuckerberg has repeatedly apologized for the Cambridge Analytica scandal, while blaming the information-sharing on a researcher who, according to Facebook, violated the platform's terms of service. Zuckerberg says he found out that the data was sold to Cambridge Analytica after The Guardian reported on the issue. \"Do you routinely learn about these violations through the press?\" Rep. Mike Doyle, D-Pa., asked on Wednesday. \"Sometimes we do,\" Zuckerberg said. He told members of the House that his own data was included in the privacy breach. Facebook co-founder and CEO Mark Zuckerberg prepares to testify before the House Energy and Commerce Committee in the Rayburn House Office Building on Capitol Hill on Wednesday. This is the second day of testimony before Congress by Zuckerberg, 33.\n                \n                    \n                    Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption Facebook co-founder and CEO Mark Zuckerberg prepares to testify before the House Energy and Commerce Committee in the Rayburn House Office Building on Capitol Hill on Wednesday. This is the second day of testimony before Congress by Zuckerberg, 33. A few of the other topics discussed in the hearing: What is Facebook? Rep. Greg Walden, R-Ore., committee chairman, noted that Facebook has exclusive broadcasting deals as well as tools that allow people to transfer money. \"Is Facebook a media company?\" he asked. \"Is Facebook a financial institution?\" Zuckerberg replied: \"I consider us to be a technology company because the primary thing that we do is have engineers that write code and build products and services for other people. There are certainly other things that we do do. ... We build planes to help connect people, and I don't consider us to be an aerospace company.\" Facebook has been testing planes that broadcast Internet signals to the ground. Does Facebook's data collection amount to surveillance of users? Rep. Bobby Rush, D-Ill., accused Facebook of \"the wholesale invasion and manipulation of users' right to privacy.\" \"What is the difference between Facebook's methodology and the methodology of the American political pariah J. Edgar Hoover?\" he asked, referring to the former FBI director. \"The difference is extremely clear, which is that on Facebook you have control over your information,\" Zuckerberg said. \"The content that you share, you put there. ... The information that we collect, you can choose to have us not collect. You can delete any of it, and of course, you can leave Facebook if you want. \"I know of no surveillance organization that gives people the option to delete the data that they have or even know what they're collecting,\" Zuckerberg said. Do consumers understand what they've agreed to as they use Facebook? Walden asked Zuckerberg, \"Did it ever cross your mind that you should be communicating more clearly with users about how Facebook is monetizing their data?\" \"I would say that we do try to explain what we do as time goes on,\" Zuckerberg said. Every time someone adds content to Facebook, he said, there is \"a control right there about who you want to share it with. ... I think that in the product that's quite clear. I do think that we can do a better job of explaining how our advertising works.\" Rep. Michael Burgess, R-Texas, approached the same question from a different angle. \"Can the average layperson look at the terms and conditions and make the evaluation: Is this strong enough protection for me to enter into this arrangement?\" he asked. Zuckerberg said, \"I think if someone wanted to know that they could, but a lot of people probably just accept terms of service without taking the time to read through it. I view our responsibility not as just legally complying with laying it out, getting that consent, but actually trying to make sure that people understand what's happening throughout the product.\" He repeatedly said he believes users do understand how their data will be used. Multiple lawmakers expressed skepticism on that point. The question of financial penalties In an occasionally tense exchange, Rep. Diana DeGette, D-Colo., challenged Zuckerberg over his company's billions of dollars in profit and what she described as the lack of financial penalty over prior privacy breaches. She cited two settled class-action lawsuits \u2014 Lane v. Facebook, in which users received no compensation, and Fraley v. Facebook, in which users received $15 each. DeGette expressed surprise when Zuckerberg said he was not familiar with the details of the cases. She also asked whether there was a financial penalty involved after a Federal Trade Commission investigation ended in a 2011 consent decree. Zuckerberg said he couldn't remember, which prompted more skepticism from DeGette. \"The reason you probably don't remember is because the FTC doesn't have the authority to issue penalties for first-time violations,\" she said. \"We continue to have these abuses and these data breaches, but at the same time, it doesn't seem like future activities are prevented,\" DeGette said. \"I think one of the things that we need to look at in the future ... is putting really robust penalties in place in case of improper actions.\" On racial diversity within Facebook's staff and leadership Congressional Black Caucus member Rep. G.K. Butterfield, D-N.C., said that Facebook lists five leaders on its website, none of whom are black. \"This does not reflect America,\" he said. \"We have a broader leadership than just five people,\" Zuckerberg said. \"Do you plan to add an African-American to your leadership team in the foreseeable future and will you commit that you will continue to work with us, the Congressional Black Caucus, to increase diversity within your company? \"Congressman, we will certainly work with you,\" Zuckerberg said. \"This is an important issue.\" Butterfield asked for data on the retention of employees by race; Zuckerberg said he would discuss it with his team. Rep. Yvette Clarke, D-N.Y., also pushed Zuckerberg hard on the question of diversity, tying the \"monolithic\" makeup of the company to Facebook's failures to anticipate and prevent disinformation campaigns. Is Facebook doing enough to stop opioid sales? Rep. David McKinley, R-W.Va., brought up America's opioid crisis and posted a photo of drugs available for sale on Facebook, no prescription necessary. \"Your platform is still being used to circumvent the law and allow people to buy highly addictive drugs without a prescription,\" he said. \"Facebook is actually enabling an illegal activity, and in so doing, you are hurting people.\" Zuckerberg replied, \"There are a number of areas of content that we need to do a better job policing on our service.\" \"You've said before you were going to take down those ads but you didn't do it,\" McKinley said. \"When are you going to take them down? ... Where is your accountability to allow this to be occurring?\" Zuckerberg said Facebook relies on users flagging inappropriate content to be taken down. He said with billions of pieces of content shared daily, it was not feasible for the company to examine all those posts. But he said the company hopes to use artificial intelligence tools to help flag inappropriate content. On Facebook's collection of data on non-Facebook users Zuckerberg's congressional testimony has focused on how Facebook handles user data. But Rep. Ben Luj\u00e1n, D-N.M., pushed Zuckerberg on how exactly Facebook uses the data of people who are not users of the service. Their conversation went like this: Luj\u00e1n: \"Facebook has detailed profiles on people who have never signed up for Facebook, yes or no?\" Zuckerberg: \"In general, we collect data from people who have not signed up from Facebook for security purposes.\" Luj\u00e1n: \"... On average, how many data points does Facebook have on each Facebook user?\" Zuckerberg: \"I do not know off the top of my head.\" Luj\u00e1n: \"The average for non-Facebook platforms is 1,500. It's been reported that Facebook has as many as 29,000 data points for an average Facebook user. Do you know how many points of data Facebook has on the average non-Facebook user?\" Zuckerberg: \"Congressman, I do not off the top off my head, but I can have our team get back to you afterwards.\" Luj\u00e1n: \"I'd appreciate that. It's been admitted by Facebook that you do collect data points on non-Facebook users, so my question is, can someone who does not have a Facebook account opt out of Facebook's involuntary data collection?\" Zuckerberg: \"Congressman, anyone can turn off and opt out of any data collection for ads, whether they use our services or not, but in order to prevent people from scraping public information ... we need to know when someone is trying to repeatedly access our services ...\u00a0\" Luj\u00e1n: \"You've said everyone controls their data, but you are collecting data on people who are not even Facebook users, that have never signed a consent, a privacy agreement, and you're collecting their data. And it may surprise you that on Facebook's page, when you go to 'I don't have a Facebook account and would like to request all my personal data stored by Facebook,' it takes you to a form that says, 'Go to your Facebook page and then on your account settings you can download your data.'\u00a0 ... You're directing people who that don't even have a Facebook page to have to sign up for a page to reach their data. We've got to fix that.\" How does Facebook use information it collects, as opposed to what users provide? In his testimony, Zuckerberg has consistently emphasized the information people voluntarily supply to Facebook \u2014 photos they upload, status updates they write, pages they click \"like\" on. He says people own that data and can delete it at any time. He also stresses that Facebook, while it uses that data to power its ad business, does not sell the data itself to advertisers. Rep. Joe Kennedy, D-Mass., pressed Zuckerberg on something different \u2014 the \"metadata\" about users that Facebook gathers without users uploading it themselves. That includes things like when and how users access Facebook and what they click on or look at, including on sites other than Facebook. (The Wall Street Journal recently published a visual breakdown of data provided vs. data collected by various platforms.) \"There's an awful lot of information that is generated that people don't think that they're generating, and that advertisers are being able to target because Facebook collects it,\" Kennedy said. \"Yes,\" Zuckerberg said. \"My understanding is that the targeting options that are available for advertisers are generally things that are based on what people share. Now, once an advertiser chooses how they want to target something, Facebook also does its own work to rank and determine which ads are going to be interesting to which people. So we may use metadata or other behaviors of what you've shown that you're interested in in news feeds or other places in order to make our systems more relevant to you, but that's a little bit different from giving that as an option to an advertiser.\" \"I don't understand how users then own that data,\" Kennedy said. He then ran out of time for questions. On its business help pages, Facebook tells advertisers it can target ads based on, among other things, users' purchase behaviors and \"activities people engage in on and off Facebook.\" Members of Congress also asked pointed questions about how Facebook will defend civil rights \u2014 by preventing housing discrimination in advertising, for instance \u2014 whether the platform suppresses conservative speech or might in the future, and the degree of responsibility Facebook has over content on its platform, including disinformation. On Tuesday, the hearing before the Senate covered many of the same topics as well. As NPR's Peter Overby reported earlier this week, Facebook \u2014 like Silicon Valley in general \u2014 has grown more involved in Washington politics over the years: \"Facebook opened its D.C. office when it was five years old \u2014 and already worth billions. It routinely hires lots of top-tier, veteran lobbyists, as does Google. \"The current lobbying environment is ideal. Many lawmakers still don't fully grasp the technology. Congress long ago defunded its in-house technology office, which could have taught them. \"Facebook reported its 2017 lobbying cost at nearly $12 million. Google spent even more: $18 million. ... Some of the money goes to think tanks, where experts can shape policy debates on Capitol Hill. ... Then there's campaign money. ... \"Facebook's PAC and employees made political contributions totaling $4.5 million in the 2016 cycle, according to the nonpartisan Center for Responsive Politics. For Google's parent company, Alphabet, the total was nearly $8 million.\"",

            "article_content": "In 1996, right after voters in California banned affirmative action in employment and college admissions, minority student enrollment at two and four-year institutions plummeted. What has happened since though, is pretty remarkable. Of the 2.8 million students attending college in California today, two out of three come from racially and ethnically diverse populations. The most eye-popping increase in enrollment has been among Latinos. They now make up 43 percent of all college students in California. Twenty-six percent are white, followed by Asian and Pacific Islanders at 16 percent and African Americans at 6 percent. Michele Siqueiros, CEO, Campaign for College Opportunity\n                \n                    \n                    Leroy Hamilton/Campaign for College Opportunity \n                    \n                \nhide caption Michele Siqueiros, CEO, Campaign for College Opportunity Business, education and civil rights groups agree these numbers are encouraging and have far-reaching implications for California's workforce and economy. But there's a problem. Among faculty and people in leadership positions, women, Latinos, blacks and Asians are still poorly represented and now, a new study is sounding the alarm. It's titled, \"Left Out: How Exclusion in California Colleges and Universities Hurts Our Values, Our Students and Our Economy\". I sat down Michele Siqueiros, who co-authored the report and heads the non-profit Campaign for College Opportunity to dig deeper into the numbers. Why does this disparity between students and faculty and administrators hurt students? When we talk to students we hear how important it is for them to see themselves in the faculty and in positions of leadership. Asian students, for example, are woefully under-represented not just among faculty but on the community college board of governors and California State University board of trustees. Overall, Latinos are the least represented even though they're the single biggest minority group. It's incredibly disturbing. Does this report offer evidence of blatant bias, racism or discrimination in hiring practices or are the findings pointing to deeper, institutional problems? We did not analyze \u2014 and I can't say for sure \u2014 that racism or bias exists. The data indicates its very probable. Newer more recent hires are not very diverse. And adjunct faculty are not diverse at all. But isn't this a \"pipeline\" problem? Not discrimination or racism, but the fact that there are so few racial and ethnic minorities on the pathway to faculty or leadership positions. I don't think the pipeline is the main problem. Higher education leaders who use that excuse are not willing to look at their own hiring practices. When we look at the numbers [of minorities] earning their masters and Ph.D.'s, we see there's a very large pool of potential faculty. Colleges need to be courageous. Are their hiring committees diverse and representative of their student body? What are colleges doing to mentor and put [minorities] on a path to senior leadership positions? In most hiring practices, we tend to hire people who are \"like us.\" The fact that hiring committees are mostly male and not diverse means that we'll continue to hire white males for positions where qualified people of color and women could be hired. Is this reflective of recent hiring policies or decades of inattention to this issue? We didn't look at trend analysis or examine what faculty and leadership looked like in the 70's, 80's or 90's. But I suspect that if we did, we would see progress. [Today] we almost have equity in the representation of women who are college presidents in the California State University system. Our report does not diminish that, but it's not enough. Fifty-four percent of undergraduate students are female and yet two-thirds of those who govern our higher education system are male. Only 7 of the 26 members of the University of California board of regents are women. Your study shows that for women, tenure is a major hurdle. If you look at the UC system, only 33 percent of tenured faculty are women. It's pretty disturbing that two-thirds of the tenured faculty are men. If the goal is proportionate representation so that faculty and institutional leaders reflect the racial, ethnic and gender make-up of California's college students, aren't you then promoting hiring quotas which the courts and many Americans oppose? I think it's desirable to ensure proportional representation. The question I would throwback is: Why is it acceptable that on some college campuses more than 70 percent of faculty and leaders are white? Why aren't we concerned about the bias and racism that prevents qualified people of color from taking up those positions? I'm not convinced that there are insufficient numbers of qualified minorities and women for these jobs. So what happens to these findings and what impact do you want your study to have? People can no longer plead ignorance. We have an election in November, so we're urging the gubernatorial candidates to consider more women and minorities in their appointments to the UC board of regents, the Cal State University board of trustees and community college board of governors. We're asking them to make a commitment to that. We need to make sure that there is equity and opportunity for [all].California cannot survive as the sixth largest economy in the world if its higher education system is leaving two-thirds of its population out of faculty and leadership positions.",

            "article_content": "During the past two years, fake news has been a frequent topic of real news, with articles considering the role of social media in spreading fake news, the advent of fake videos and the role these play in the political process. Something less well-known, though, is that fake news has also become a topic of scientific investigation. In a paper published in March in the journal Science, David Lazer, Matthew Baum and 14 co-authors consider what we do and don't know about the science of fake news. They define fake news as \"fabricated information that mimics news media content in form but not in organizational process or intent,\" and they go on to discuss problems at multiple levels: individual, institutional and societal. What do we know about individuals' exposure to fake news and its influence upon them? How can Internet platforms help limit the dissemination of fake news? And most fundamentally: How can we succeed in creating and perpetuating a culture that values and promotes truth? Fitting for this broad focus, the authors represent a variety of areas of expertise. Lazer and Baum, the paper's lead authors, are affiliated with programs in network science, quantitative social science, global communications and public policy. Other contributors hail from law schools, departments of psychology, schools of journalism and industry research groups, to name just a few. The paper makes a compelling case that the science of fake news is timely and important. One conservative estimate is that in the month before the 2016 election, the average American was exposed to somewhere between one and three articles from a known publisher of fake news. Another alarming result is that when it comes to political topics, tweets containing false information propagate more rapidly and broadly on Twitter than those containing reliable information. As a cognitive scientist, one of the questions that most fascinates me is whether and how fake news affects people's attitudes and behaviors. This is a question for social science, with a particular role for social and cognitive psychology. To find out more, I reached out to Steven Sloman, professor of cognitive, linguistic and psychological sciences at Brown University, and one of the paper's 16 authors. Sloman is also author of The Knowledge Illusion: Why We Never Think Alone, a book about the merits and failings of our collaborative minds, published in 2017 with co-author Philip Fernbach. Sloman was kind enough to answer a few questions about the science of fake news by e-mail. Our exchange is below. Your science paper is unusual in bringing together 16 authors who span disciplines, academia and industry. What brought you together over the topic of fake news? The election of 2016 and its immediate aftermath scared many of us out of our political daze. The new administration's willingness to make up facts while accusing mainstream media of doing the same woke us up to the reality that we would have to fight if we wanted to ensure that public opinion would have some grounding in evidence. To solidify resistance to the post-truth era, David Lazer and Matthew Baum organized a conference at Harvard entitled \"Combating Fake News: An Agenda for Research and Action.\" They invited political scientists, legal experts, information network specialists, psychologists, fact checkers, historians, pollsters, and journalists to come together to share perspectives and insights. Guided by David and Matt, that conference turned into the paper in Science. Misinformation, disinformation and political propaganda are not new. Does \"fake news\" today present a novel or especially acute problem? If so, why? You're absolutely right that political interests have lied and distorted facts to help achieve their own ends probably since the dawn of civilization (and maybe before). The problem today is threefold. First, because of technology, anyone in the world can be a source of news. To get people's attention, one only needs to be clever enough to excite the interest of enough people in order for your message to go viral. One way to do this is to put your message in the hands of social media bots, machines whose sole purpose is to fool social media into thinking they are real people so that their contribution counts (e.g., by massively increasing the number of \"likes\" on Facebook). Success has little to do with the truth of one's message. Second, again because of technology, we are inundated by information. We just don't have time to separate the facts from the falsities. Even fact-checkers don't have time. A message can go viral before any serious truth filter has been applied. This leads to a positive feedback cycle. If one team is passing around unfiltered information, then its opponents feel the need to respond in real time. So they won't be able to check their facts either. The positive feedback is further increased by individuals' tendency not to read very carefully. People share messages without even reading them, never mind evaluating their accuracy. Finally, the huge variety of news media in our culture means that people have the freedom to tune into news sources that tell them what they want to hear, and we all like to hear news consistent with our beliefs. Some cable TV stations, for instance, don't even pretend to be unbiased. They each serve up a digestible meal of news to their respective partisans. We no longer have Walter Cronkite providing the entire country with a common set of facts. What can psychology, in particular, contribute to our understanding of fake news? Psychological methodology has some obvious things to offer: Does tagging news as fake reduce its effect on public opinion? What kind of personalities are most susceptible to fake news? Does repetition of fake news make it seem more true? What properties of fake news make it seem real? Lots of psychologists are addressing questions such as these, and some of the answers are cited in the Science piece. One of my favorite pieces of research is Gordon Pennycook and David Rand's demonstrations that the propensity to think analytically as measured by the Cognitive Reflection Test (CRT) predicts who is able to distinguish fake news from real news. I think this is important because it indicates what skills are required to identify fake news, namely, the ability to reflect before responding rather than going immediately with one's gut intuition (as most of us do most of the time). Perhaps more important, it shows that it's possible for individuals to discriminate fake from real news, though it isn't easy, especially when the fake news is created by a pro. Despite relevant prior work in psychology, there are many open questions concerning fake news, its propagation, its consequences, and how any negative consequences can be mitigated. What do you see as the most pressing open research question(s) for psychological science? I think there's a deep question about fake news that has not been fully addressed: Does it really matter? The great fear that civil society will be undermined by a false narrative supported by \"alternative facts\" presupposes that people's beliefs are influenced by what they perceive to be facts. But the history of psychology shows that it's not so simple. We know that the primary determinant of whether people believe a message is whether or not they agree with it. If they don't, they're much more likely to check its veracity. Moreover, opinion depends more on the beliefs of your community than it does on facts. Individuals are just not rational processors of information. So fake news may be more about flag waving \u2014 reinforcing people's group affiliations \u2014 than it is about persuasion. Does it in fact influence belief? And what else does it influence? For example, does it affect people's feelings of resentment more than their attitudes? These are questions that psychologists should focus more on, and questions that a responsible government would want to fund research on. You and your co-authors write that in the face of fake news and its dissemination by social and other forms of media, \"A new system of safeguards is needed.\" What kinds of safeguards can individual news consumers (as opposed to governments or producers) put into place? In particular, can psychological science offer any advice for media consumers who want to limit their susceptibility to fake news? The simplistic answer is \"be more reflective.\" Don't believe everything you read, but consider the possibility that it's false. But I consider this too simplistic. The problem with fake news is the cultural narrative that it supports. The worst kind of fake news gets people discussing the implications of something that just isn't true. So the right kind of solution should be cultural. We need to foster norms of discourse in which it's OK to challenge what others say without the conversation immediately devolving into invective. The most effective lab meetings are like that: If someone disagrees with the presenter, they say so (politely). And by doing so, they might be saving the presenter from embarrassment in a more public forum. A community that encourages individuals to point out when statements are false (or unclear or vacuous) benefits everybody by helping discern the truth. In the long run, the truth will win out. My preferred society encourages the truth to win out before great damage is done. Tania Lombrozo is a psychology professor at the University of California, Berkeley.

            "article_content": "Wyoming attorney Karen Budd-Falen, recently named as Deputy Solicitor for Parks and Wildlife at the Department of the Interior, sits in her law office in Cheyenne, Wyo.\n                \n                    \n                    Mead Gruver/AP\n                    \n                \nhide caption Wyoming attorney Karen Budd-Falen, recently named as Deputy Solicitor for Parks and Wildlife at the Department of the Interior, sits in her law office in Cheyenne, Wyo. A Wyoming property rights attorney who's long criticized what she calls federal overreach over public land management will take a position as one of the U.S. Department of Interior's top litigators. The DOI confirmed in an email Monday that Karen Budd-Falen will join the agency as deputy solicitor for parks and wildlife. Despite being a vocal opponent of federal lands policy, she told The Fence Post magazine she believes there are a lot of \"good people\" in Washington and she hopes she'll be able to bring the perspective of the West to the agency. \"I think unless you've lived out here and tried to make a living on the land and really worked with people out here, I think you don't have the perspective,\" she said. Budd-Falen had reportedly been considered as a finalist to lead the Bureau of Land Management. The bureau doesn't have a permanent leader under the Trump administration. She also served on the president's transition team after the 2016 election. In Wyoming and elsewhere in the rural West, Budd-Falen has made a career of representing ranchers and local governments in property rights' disputes with federal land agencies. In the early 1990s, she worked as a consultant for a county in rural New Mexico that openly tried to challenge federal control of the land. And more recently she's traveled the rural West speaking to county commissioners about ways to have more local input in federal management decisions, appearances that occasionally draw protesters who support public lands. The announcement has drawn swift criticism from environmental groups who have tried to tie Budd-Falen to the so-called Sagebrush Rebellion. That's the term given to a near-century-old loose association of ranchers who graze their cattle on public lands that argue, sometimes violently, that the federal government has no authority over the land. Land Tawney, president of the Montana-based conservation group, Backcountry Hunters and Anglers said Budd-Falen has a history of attacking the very agency she'll now join. \"We should be putting people into leadership positions that want to build and make things better, versus those that have spent a career trying to take them down,\" Tawney said. The choice of such an outspoken critic of federal lands management for a top role in a federal lands agency is unusual, though not necessarily a surprise in the Trump administration. Interior Sec. Ryan Zinke has repeatedly said he opposes any effort to transfer federal public land ownership into state control or private interests. It's unclear how much \u2014 if any \u2014 influence Budd-Falen might have when it comes to those decisions. In a statement, the DOI said only that they were excited to have someone with such extensive industry experience joining the agency. Budd-Falen did not immediately respond to a request for an interview. But as a deputy solicitor, she has said she expects to work on legal issues surrounding the Endangered Species Act, the National Park Service and national monuments. The Trump administration has dramatically reduced the size of several national monuments recently, including the Bears Ears and Grand Staircase-Escalante monuments in Utah, where tribal groups and environmentalists have sued to block the plan. Budd-Falen is originally from Wyoming, where she grew up on her family's fifth generation cattle ranch near Big Piney. This is not the first time she's worked at the Department of Interior \u2014 she was an appointee and served in the Reagan administration for three years, specializing mostly in mineral leasing. She's expected to assume her new role at DOI in early November.",
