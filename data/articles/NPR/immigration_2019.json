Donald Trump's immigration stances \u2014 family separation, a ban on immigrants from several majority-Muslim nations, the cancellation of the Deferred Action For Childhood Arrivals program, to name a few \u2014 have given Democrats much to criticize as the 2020 presidential election approaches.

However, they differ on the particulars of what policies they would like to put into place instead and, in many cases, have not articulated what they would do specifically.

They call themselves the \"Sardines\" \u2014 because they want to quietly pack Italy's main public squares like fish in a can. Organizers say their goal is to stop a far-right, anti-immigrant wave rising in Italian society and politics. On Saturday, tens of thousands turned out in Rome's St. John Lateran Square for their largest rally yet. Retirees mingled with teenagers and families with kids, many holding fish-shaped signs. They sang Bella Ciao, a World War II-era anthem of the anti-fascist resistance. For the past month, the grassroots Sardines movement against populism and racism has drawn growing crowds and intense national media attention. It comes as populist politicians have amassed large followings while promoting a nationalist agenda and bashing immigration, seeking to win regional Italian elections next month. To counter hateful rhetoric, the Sardines say they are staging peaceful flash mobs to spread messages of civility, equality and social inclusion. \"By taking a stand, we can create a new narrative \u2014 the first step toward a new reality,\" movement co-founder Mattia Santori told the crowd in Rome on Saturday. Participants in a rally in Rome hold sardine-shaped signs, a symbol of the movement.\n                \n                    \n                    Sylvia Poggioli/NPR\n                    \n                \nhide caption Participants in a rally in Rome hold sardine-shaped signs, a symbol of the movement. The movement began a month ago in the northern Italian city Bologna in response to the growing popularity of the politician Matteo Salvini, leader of the right-wing, anti-immigrant League party. Bologna is the capital of the Emilia-Romagna region. Once a center-left bastion, the region's attitudes have been shifting rightward and polls suggest the League could win regional elections there in January. Posting on Facebook, Santori and three friends announced an anti-Salvini rally for Nov. 14. They aimed to attract 6,000 people \u2014 and more than doubled that turnout. The idea caught on in other Italian cities. Lorenzo Donnoli, who days later organized a Sardine rally in another city of the region, Ferrara, told NPR the movement's name symbolizes civil society's strength in numbers. \"Being a Sardine means to be part of a huge group \u2014 a sea \u2014 to be part of a sea to defend you, defend our mutual ideas and values and use this energy to share the values around the country, around the world,\" he says. Then a man named Stephen Ogongo launched a Rome Sardines Facebook group around midnight a few days later. By morning, 10,000 requested to join. Today it has over 145,700 members. A native of Kenya, Ogongo says he did not believe Italians were racist when he first arrived 25 years ago to study at Rome's Pontifical Gregorian University. But when right-wing politicians exploited frustrations over higher numbers of migrants, he says, many Italians kept quiet. \"This made racist politicians believe that they had a majority in the country because they were so vocal and their supporters who are equally vocal, that people who were not racist in a way went underground,\" he says. Roberto Marozzi (from left), Mattia Santori and Andrea Gareffa are three of the original Sardines founders in Bologna.\n                \n                    \n                    Sylvia Poggioli/NPR\n                    \n                \nhide caption Roberto Marozzi (from left), Mattia Santori and Andrea Gareffa are three of the original Sardines founders in Bologna.

It's an opportunity \"to gather and rediscover that the beauty and the strength that feeling close to each other can bring to the political discourse,\" he says. Sardines in Rome this weekend expressed a similar sentiment. \"I feel in unison with these people,\" one Rome rallygoer, Tania Alessandri, said. \"Their ideals have reawakened my political consciousness and stimulated my need to participate in the political process. I feel vital again.\" Standing nearby, white-haired Settimia Migliori agreed. \"There's something new in the air here \u2014 I like these young people's ideas. After so much hatred, oppression, exclusion and indifference, their language is new and civilized,\" Migliori said.

League leader Salvini has mocked the movement, tweeting that he likes kittens more because they \"eat sardines.\" He later softened his tone, saying, \"The more people participate, the better.\" Sardines co-founder Santori does not want the movement to become a political party. He is aware, however, that the movement has tapped into something potentially powerful. \"How do we channel this energy?\" he asks, \"how do we reach our original goal to curb \u2014 hopefully stop \u2014 the populist wave and propose a political idea that's both serious and appealingly cool?\" Meeting after the Rome rally, the Sardines organizers agreed to continue to focus on regional elections in January. They plan to stage more rallies especially in small towns and rural areas \u2014 more vulnerable, they believe, to the siren call of right-wing populism.",

Cuccinelli, the former attorney general of Virginia, has made enemies in his own party. He used to lead a group that raised money to challenge incumbent Republican senators, including Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell. Trump announced two weeks ago that Kevin McAleenan, who had been the acting secretary, would leave his post. That touched off a wave of jockeying for the position between competing factions inside the White House over who should lead the department charged with immigration policy, a key pillar of his presidency and re-election campaign. Sources say immigration hard-liners inside and outside the White House are fighting to keep Cuccinelli \u2014 who Trump made his acting director of U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services \u2014 in the running. A Republican Senate aide told NPR that Trump has said he would name Cuccinelli if he thought Senate leadership would support his nomination. A White House official confirmed Trump has told allies he wants Cuccinelli in the role. \"President Trump needs someone at DHS that believes in his vision for immigration enforcement, and that person is Ken Cuccinelli,\" the Republican Senate aide said. Cuccinelli has championed some of Trump's toughest immigration policies, including new protocols making it harder for immigrants to obtain legal permanent residency by denying green cards to those who use or are likely to use government benefits, such as Medicaid and food stamps. A spokesman for McConnell declined to comment, but directed NPR to previous comments the Republican leader has expressed about Cuccinelli as a candidate for the job. \"I've not spoken to [Trump] about any of them. I have expressed my, shall I say, lack of enthusiasm for one of them ... Ken Cuccinelli,\" McConnell told reporters during a briefing in April. Cuccinelli did not mince words when raising money for the Senate Conservatives Fund in August 2017, criticizing sitting Republican senators. \"Mitch McConnell has filled the Senate with people like Lisa Murkowski, John McCain, Shelley Moore Capito, Lamar Alexander, and Dean Heller who all promised the voters they would repeal Obamacare, but when the time came to do it they refused,\" Cuccinelli wrote in a fundraising message for the group, Roll Call reported. \"Instead of admitting his mistake, McConnell is blaming the president for having 'excessive expectations' even though he was the one who set those expectations with years of empty promises!\" It's unlikely that enough Republican senators would support a nominee who led efforts to defeat them, said Alex Conant, former communications director for Sen. Marco Rubio's 2016 presidential campaign. Republican Senators are angry about Syria, weary of an impeachment trial and would rather not confirm somebody who is likely to cause more headaches. Alex Conant \"Given the president's precarious political situation, asking Republican senators to support someone who funded primaries against them is a difficult ask,\" Conant said. \"Republican Senators are angry about Syria, weary of an impeachment trial and would rather not confirm somebody who is likely to cause more headaches.\" White House staffers have warned Trump that Cuccinelli is not eligible to become acting DHS secretary because of technicalities in federal vacancy rules, according to two people familiar with the conversations. Sean Doocey, the White House director of presidential personnel, told Trump that both Cuccinelli and another candidate \u2014 Mark Morgan, the acting commissioner of U.S. Customs and Border Protection \u2014 were ineligible because of federal vacancy laws. But hard-liners have argued the White House should find work-arounds to federal vacancy rules. The Federation for American Immigration Reform, a group close to the administration that advocates for immigration restrictions, argues McConnell works with other Republican senators once backed by the Senate Conservatives Fund, so he should be able to get over his political differences with Cuccinelli. While the fund once backed a primary challenger to McConnell, that was before Cuccinelli became its president, FAIR says. Dan Stein, president of FAIR, warned Republicans could face political consequences by picking the wrong person in the middle of an election year. \"Enough with the acting secretaries \u2013 come together and confirm someone who works well with the president and is totally in line with his immigration agenda,\" Stein said.",

Updated at 10:02 p.m. ET Acting Homeland Security Secretary Kevin McAleenan is leaving his post, the latest casualty at the department responsible for protecting U.S. borders. President Trump said in a tweet Friday night that McAleenan had done an \"outstanding job\" but that he wanted to \"spend more time with family and go to the private sector.\" Trump added that he would announce a new acting secretary next week. Kevin McAleenan has done an outstanding job as Acting Secretary of Homeland Security. We have worked well together with Border Crossings being way down. Kevin now, after many years in Government, wants to spend more time with his family and go to the private sector.... During his tenure, McAleenan, a career civil servant, managed to decrease the number of people entering the United States illegally across the southern border. But in an interview with The Washington Post last week, he complained about the \"tone, the message, the public face and approach\" of the nation's immigration policy. The departure continues a purge of leadership at the Department of Homeland Security at Trump's behest and raises more uncertainty over management at the massive agency created after the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks. Trump supporters praised the decision. \"President Trump is now completely rid of the team that delayed, undermined, and stalled the 2016 election's mandate,\" a hard-line immigration enforcement ally of the administration said. \"He has what he's never had before: competent personnel to carry out his vision on immigration.\" Some are already calling for Trump to move acting Citizenship and Immigration Services Director Ken Cuccinelli into the role. \"The president understands that the opposition seeks to stop his efforts to secure the border and restore control over our nation's immigration system through court orders and injunctions,\" the ally said. \"What better force to stop this than the former AG of Virginia and one of the most skilled appellate lawyers in the country?\" Since April, former Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen, U.S. Secret Service Director Randolph \"Tex\" Alles and acting U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement Director Ronald Vitiello have resigned. In June, Trump also accepted the resignation of acting Customs and Border Protection Commissioner John Sanders. Trump elevated McAleenan to serve as acting replacement for Nielsen just days after he said he wanted the administration to go in a \"tougher direction\" as illegal border crossings had increased. McAleenan previously served as commissioner of U.S. Customs and Border Protection after having served as acting commissioner since the beginning of the Trump administration. He was well-liked among Republican and Democratic administrations. In a letter to Congress obtained by ABC News expressing \"enthusiastic support\" for McAleenan's nomination to lead U.S. Customs and Border Protection, officials from both the George W. Bush and Barack Obama administrations called McAleenan \"supremely qualified.\" But he quickly drew scrutiny from hard-liners close to Trump for his ties to the Obama administration, where he was deputy commissioner of the agency. McAleenan thanked Trump for the opportunity to serve and said DHS had \"made tremendous progress mitigating the border security and humanitarian crisis.\"",

Australia's Prime Minister Scott Morrison won re-election on Saturday, stunning pollsters who had anticipated his defeat for several months. Morrison championed working-class economic stability during his campaign, and his victory is part of a populist trend, which now stretches across the U.S., Brazil, Hungary and Italy. At his victory party in Sydney, Morrison said, \"Tonight is about every single Australian who depends on their government to put them first. And that is exactly what we are going to do.\" In his speech, Morrison also paid tribute to \"the quiet Australians\" who voted for his coalition. \"It has been those Australians who have worked hard every day, they have their dreams, they have their aspirations, to get a job, to get an apprenticeship, to start a business, to meet someone amazing,\" he said. \"To start a family, to buy a home, to work hard and provide the best you can for your kids.

Morrison's coalition of Liberal and National Parties maintained seats in contested suburbs, while also picking up support across Australia's countryside. In the northeastern state of Queensland, the site of a controversial proposal to build a coal mine, several Liberal Party candidates also won, signifying that jobs are of more importance to Australian voters there than environmental concerns. If the Adani coal mine is built in Queensland, it will be one of the largest in the world. In a suburb of Sydney, however, the Liberal Party did suffer a setback. Former Prime Minister Tony Abbott lost his race there, where voters are demanding action on climate change. In his concession speech, Abbott said, \"It's clear that in what might be described as 'working seats,' we are doing so much better. It's also clear that in at least some of what might be described as 'wealthy seats,' we are doing it tough, and the Green left is doing better.\" Morrison is an evangelical Christian, who has professed admiration for President Trump. During his campaign he promised voters he would lower energy prices, and cut costs for first-time homeowners. In 2013, as immigration minister, Morrison advocated denying asylum seekers arriving by sea the right to apply for settlement in Australia. Morrison's opponent, Bill Shorten, the leader of the Labor Party, promised \"real action\" on climate change and the economy. On Saturday night he conceded defeat. \"I know you're all hurting,\" he told supporters in Melbourne. \"And I am, too.\"",

Updated at 5:45 p.m. ET Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban visited the White House on Monday, his first formal meeting with a U.S. president in more than 20 years. Then-President Bill Clinton received Orban, now one of Europe's most prominent nationalists, in 1998, back when the Hungarian leader was a 35-year-old reformist who had earned his pro-democracy street cred as an anti-Soviet activist. Orban had helped his country transition out of communism. Today, Orban is running Hungary like a \"soft autocracy,\" according to one biographer, and alarming the European Union. The Obama administration limited diplomatic ties with Hungary over concern that Orban is undermining democratic values. But some analysts say the Hungarian leader has found a kindred spirit in President Trump, a fellow nationalist. Trump's former chief strategist, Steve Bannon, once called Orban \"Trump before Trump.\" The two men both have hard-line views on immigration. They slam critical coverage as fake news. Both have strained relationships with traditional American allies in Europe, and both have spoken positively about Russian President Vladimir Putin. \"Both Donald Trump and Viktor Orban have made immigration their signature issue,\" says Kim Lane Scheppele, the Laurance S. Rockefeller professor of sociology and international affairs at Princeton University and an expert on Hungary. \"Whipping fears and nationalist sentiments is exactly how they operate. So it would be really tempting to say that they're working from the same song sheet. And they sort of are, at the level of rhetoric and rallies and election campaigns.\" The difference, according to Scheppele, is that Orban has had far more success turning his campaign pledges into law. \"Viktor Orban's a lawyer, and he works like a lawyer and he works by the law,\" she says. \"And in that way, what that enables him to do is to pass legal reforms that are instructions to the government, instructions to the civil service. He actually creates a legal blueprint that captures everybody in its web.\" Orban is considered a brilliant political tactician whose ruthlessness was forged after his Fidesz party lost elections in 2002 and he found himself out of power. \"Viktor Orban is famous for his view that politics is war,\" says Gabor Gyori, a senior analyst at the Budapest-based Policy Solutions think tank. \"This is destroy or be destroyed.\" Under Orban, Hungary has rewritten its constitution to strengthen his control over parliament and has gerrymandered the country's electoral map. His party, which controls parliament, has weakened the courts. Orban supporters control most of the media; critics are either ignored or vilified. His administration is cracking down on nonprofits supporting migrants and minorities. \"This all has the veneer of legality, so you assume Hungary is still a democracy based on the rule of law and respecting fundamental rights and European Union values,\" says Petra Bard, a Hungarian constitutional law scholar now living in Frankfurt, Germany. \"It's hard to stomach that laws have been used to drive a democratic country into authoritarianism.\" Orban has told supporters that he wants to transform Hungary into an \"illiberal democracy,\" balancing individual freedom with the interests of the nation. He promised Hungarians that he would protect the country's homogeneity. \"We must defend Hungary as it is now,\" he said in a speech last year. \"We must state that we do not want to be diverse. ... We do not want our own color, traditions and national culture to be mixed with those of others.\" That sentiment was most prominently on display in 2015, when hundreds of thousands of asylum-seekers from the Middle East and elsewhere trekked through Europe. Many tried to cross through Hungary to reach Western European countries like Germany and Sweden. Orban was outraged that migrants, many of them Muslim, could cross into \"Christian Europe.\" He eventually built a barbed-wire border fence to keep them out of Hungary. They instead rerouted to neighboring countries like Croatia and Slovenia. \"I would like to raise the voice of the people all over in Europe that they are full of fear,\" Orban told reporters in 2015. \"And the reason why they are criticizing us is that we are not defending the European borders.\" The message hit home in Hungary, where church bells ring every day at noon to commemorate a military commander who stopped an invasion by Ottoman Turks in 1456. In the southern city of Pecs, Kazmer Szabo, a 79-year-old retired dental technician, considers Orban a protector. He points to an Ottoman-era mosque in the city square. \"At the end of the day, this is about history,\" he says. \"Orban understands that we are a country that was once occupied for 150 years by the Turks. We know what that means.\" The number of migrants arriving in Europe is now at its lowest level since 2014, largely because of deals struck by centrist politicians such as German Chancellor Angela Merkel and former Italian Interior Minister Marco Minniti. Yet Orban and his surrogates falsely accuse Hungarian American billionaire George Soros of encouraging migrants to come again. During election season, Soros' face is plastered on billboards and anti-immigration ads. On recent billboards, he was pictured with Jean-Claude Juncker, the European Commission's president, who the Orban administration claims is working with Soros to revive migration. \"We have seen how George Soros and his network of NGOs, civil groups and lobby organizations ... have infiltrated European institutions,\" says Balazs Hidveghi, the spokesman for Orban's political party, Fidesz. Because Soros is Jewish, this vilification unnerves Andras Heisler, who leads the Federation of Hungarian Jewish Communities in Budapest. \"George Soros is the emblematic Jewish capitalist,\" Heisler says. \"To make a campaign with his face, his smile \u2014 this is playing with fire.\" Soros founded Central European University, which he created as a bridge between post-communist eastern and central Europe and the more open West. Orban's administration has expelled the institution from Hungary, claiming it is forcing multiculturalism on a country that doesn't want it. CEU is an American institution, but Orban doesn't seem concerned about upsetting the United States. It's not the first time. Late last year, his administration refused an American extradition request for two suspected Russian arms dealers, instead sending them back to Russia. The White House said it hoped to use Orban's visit as an opportunity to lure Hungary away from Russia and China by signing agreements on arms and natural gas. But in a letter to Trump last week, members of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee said they want Orban to address his country's \"downward democratic trajectory and the implications for U.S. interests in Central Europe.\" The European Union has also issued warnings to Hungary about its backsliding on democracy, but Orban has faced no serious punishment. Instead, says Scheppele, the Hungary expert at Princeton, he is inspiring nationalists across the world. \"Orban uses a language that's like a dog whistle not just in his own country but to autocrats and right-wing nationalists everywhere in the world,\" she says. \"He's created in plain sight an autocratic regime in the middle of the EU, winning what look like real elections, passing what look like real laws. ... Other autocrats want to know, how do you do it?\"",

Separate events held Saturday evening in the nation's capital and a Wisconsin arena painted two divergent pictures of the press. In Washington, the White House Correspondents' Association dinner, an annual comedic event, was light on jokes and replete instead with warnings about the consequences of attacks on the free press. Meanwhile, President Trump rallied supporters in Green Bay, touting economic growth and repeating familiar calls of \"fake news\" to a cheering crowd. He also disparaged special counsel Robert Mueller's investigation, mocked Democratic presidential contenders Joe Biden, Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren and boasted about the media presence at his rally. \"Can you imagine Sleepy Joe, Crazy Bernie. ... Can you imagine any of those people up here doing what I'm doing?\" he said. \"I think, Pocahontas, she's finished, she's out, she's gone,\" he said as well, using his preferred nickname for Warren. The president's decision to skip the glitzy, annual event in favor of a campaign rally came as no surprise. Trump has avoided the dinner every year since he became president, breaking with more than three decades of tradition. And while some White House officials had planned to attend as guests of the various news organizations that the event honors, the administration announced last Tuesday that it would completely boycott the celebration. Olivier Knox, WHCA president, asked attendees of the dinner to turn their attention to journalists who are \"suffering for their craft\" around the world and to advocate for the release of Austin Tice, a freelance journalist kidnapped while reporting in Syria in 2012. \"This is not [Trump's] dinner \u2014 it is ours,\" said Knox. \"And it should stay ours.\" In another break with tradition, the evening's keynote address was delivered by historian Ron Chernow. The dinner has typically featured a comedian cracking jokes at the expense of the president, who has also usually offered up his own roast of other politicians and the media. The change in format followed a controversial performance last year by comedian Michelle Wolf, who faced criticism for her remarks \u2014 mostly about the Trump administration \u2014 which were called \"harsh\" and \"risqu\u00e9.\" Knox said he had asked Chernow to speak as part of an effort to focus the event more on journalism itself. The WHCA has previously faced criticism of the event, including that it seems extravagant, excessively cozy with the White House and removed from its stated purpose of supporting scholarships, as Politico reports. In his speech on Saturday night, Chernow narrated the history of journalists in the White House \u2014 touching on everything from how the press once shielded the private lives of presidents to Eleanor Roosevelt's role in elevating female correspondents \u2014 as he made a case for the free press and the First Amendment. \"Relations between presidents and the press are inevitably tough, almost always adversarial, but they don't need to be steeped in venom,\" he said. Chernow also offered a defense of comedians, quoting comedian Will Rogers in saying that the United States has arrived at a point where \"people are taking their comedians seriously and their politicians as a joke.\" In that spirit, he cracked more than a few jokes to varying degrees of success, the subjects of which included the Mueller report, Alexander Hamilton (\"an immigrant who arrived, thank God, before the country was full\") and his own speech (a \"20-minute sedative\" for the evening). President Trump disparaged Democratic presidential candidates and the news media during a rally in Green Bay, Wis., on Saturday.\n                \n                    \n                    Lauren Justice/Bloomberg via Getty Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption President Trump disparaged Democratic presidential candidates and the news media during a rally in Green Bay, Wis., on Saturday. Shortly before Chernow and Knox spoke about public mistrust of journalism and a tide of misinformation, a crowd at the president's rally in Wisconsin chanted \"CNN sucks\" as the president joked about the network. \"I'll tell you, you know what sucks? Their ratings suck,\" he said. \"Because people don't believe them.\" Trump spent much of the night promoting the U.S. economy and talking about \"unfair\" trade practices from countries like India and China. He pointed to the 3.2% annualized GDP growth in the first quarter that showed the economy gaining steam \u2014 and cited job gains in Wisconsin, a state that served as a tipping point in the 2016 presidential election. He also discussed immigration and the detention of undocumented migrants, telling the crowd that \"illegal immigrants\" arriving at the border have placed \"a massive strain on communities and schools and hospitals and public resources, like nobody's ever seen before.\" At one point he brought press secretary Sarah Sanders on stage and showered her with praise. Sanders told the crowd she was proud to work for the president. \"Last year, this night, I was at a slightly different event, not quite the best welcome, so this is an amazing honor,\" she said, referring to her attendance at the 2018 WHCA dinner, where she was the subject of several of Wolf's controversial cracks. Trump also took time at the start of his rally to offer condolences to the victims of Saturday's synagogue shooting near San Diego and to denounce anti-Semitism. \"Our entire nation mourns the loss of life, prays for the wounded and stands in solidarity with the Jewish community,\" he said.",

Hungary's National Day celebrations commemorate the 1848 Hungarian Revolution against the Habsburg monarchy. The European Union has largely tolerated Hungary's nationalist Prime Minister Viktor Orban, despite his government's crackdown on civil society and virulently anti-migrant rhetoric. Then came the billboards depicting two elderly men who appear to be cackling. One is the president of the European Commission, Jean-Claude Juncker. The other is Hungarian-American billionaire George Soros, who Orban loyalists falsely claim is plotting to flood Europe with Muslim migrants. \"You have the right to know what Brussels is planning,\" the billboard reads. \"It's shocking that such a ludicrous conspiracy theory has reached the mainstream,\" European Commission spokesman Margaritis Schinas told reporters last month. Juncker is a prominent member of the European People's Party, which represents conservative EU parties in the European Parliament, including Orban's Fidesz. He has targeted Orban as \"the origin of fake news.\" The European People's Party is expected to make a decision in the next few days about what to do with Fidesz. Several top officials in the European group want to expel their Hungarian partners. A billboard in Budapest, Hungary, shows European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker and Hungarian-American billionaire George Soros, whom the Hungarian government has falsely accused of sending migrants to Europe.\n                \n                    \n                    Attila Kisbenedek/AFP/Getty Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption A billboard in Budapest, Hungary, shows European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker and Hungarian-American billionaire George Soros, whom the Hungarian government has falsely accused of sending migrants to Europe. \"If Viktor Orban doesn't manage to create trust in the coming days among the EPP parties and his critics, then things will be difficult,\" European People's Party leader Manfred Weber told the German magazine Der Spiegel in an interview published Friday. The Hungarian government even tried to cover up the offensive posters when Weber recently visited Budapest for talks with Orban. But in the cozy town of Hatvan, just outside Hungary's capital of Budapest, the billboards have frightened some residents. \"I'm afraid of George Soros because he brought the migrants,\" says Erika Gazdag, though she isn't sure who Soros is. \"Now I am afraid of the EU.\" Gazdag spoke as her husband had finished surgery at a local hospital that was revamped with EU money. She says she fears that migrants \"rape our women and kill people. It's all over the news.\" Most of the country's media are controlled by a foundation loyal to the government, who accuse EU leaders of mishandling the 2015 refugee crisis when more than 1 million asylum-seekers came into Europe. Orban loyalists say his policies keep out migrants and defend his administration's anti-Brussels billboard campaign. \"It's about ideology,\" says Bank Boros, an analyst with the conservative think tank Medianezo, explaining the campaign against who he calls the \"Brussels elite.\" \"George Soros wants to see an open society letting migrants in, bringing down borders, and creating some kind of utopian community in the EU. His best friend, Juncker, is pretty much supporting this idea.\" At his office in Fidesz headquarters overlooking the Danube in Budapest, party spokesman Balazs Hidveghi defends the anti-Brussels billboards. \"We see a deliberate, pro-migration campaign in the European Commission,\" he says.\n                \n                    \n                    Joanna Kakissis/NPR\n                    \n                \nhide caption At his office in Fidesz headquarters overlooking the Danube in Budapest, party spokesman Balazs Hidveghi defends the anti-Brussels billboards. \"We see a deliberate, pro-migration campaign in the European Commission,\" he says. At his seventh-floor office in Fidesz headquarters in Budapest, party spokesman Balazs Hidveghi says the billboards \"call things as they are.\" \"Maybe the Brussels elite are not used to such direct campaign methods,\" says Hidveghi, who is running for European Parliament elections in May. The number of migrants entering the EU has dropped to its lowest level in five years, in part because of measures by centrist leaders such as German Chancellor Angela Merkel. She has faced criticism in Hungary and elsewhere for letting in asylum-seekers, many of them fleeing war in Afghanistan, Iraq and Syria. Supporters of migration argue that, in addition to offering safety and opportunities to refugees and migrants in need, more workers are needed in Germany and other countries with labor shortages. \"Politicians are saying that, well, the European population is decreasing, there are not enough children born, so what we need to help our economies, etc., is to bring in people from Africa, people from the Middle East and Asia,\" Hidveghi says. \"We don't believe that's the right answer.\" The Orban administration is instead giving tax breaks to Hungarian mothers with at least four children. In a twist, the government printed billboards for its family campaign using the infamous couple from the \"distracted boyfriend\" stock photo that has launched countless memes. I am still laughing. Govt of #Hungary uses the distracted boyfriend-meme for its latest \u2018Make more babies and we will pay you\u2019 campaign pic.twitter.com/H7TOkj31SD The baby-making is supposed to offset Hungary's growing labor shortage that is partly the result of tens of thousands of Hungarians leaving for better-paying jobs in other EU countries. Hidveghi says the EU has benefited from Hungary. \"We've opened our markets, we've opened our economies,\" he says. \"It's also beneficial for the investors, for the multinational companies mostly from Western Europe who bought up entire industries and took advantage of cheaper labor.\" He does not see the EU money that goes into Hungarian roads and schools and hospitals as a gift or a handout.

He says EU money is often misused in the country. \"It's often channeled into the pockets of people close to the government who overspend or simply do terrible work,\" he says.\n                \n                    \n                    Joanna Kakissis/NPR\n                    \n                \nhide caption Sandor Lederer runs K-Monitor, an anti-corruption watchdog in Budapest, Hungary.

An example of the latter, he says, is a bicycle road and adventure park that cost the EU nearly $4 million. The park is damaged and deserted. The entrance is locked so local councilman Jozsef Biro lets us in. He says the park has had only 41 visitors since 2015. \"The EU gives us money to promote tourism,\" he says. \"This was supposed to be a park for extreme cyclists but it looks like a half-finished construction site. It's like telling the EU: keep sending the money but this is how we'll spend it.\" At a nearby cafe, middle-aged dockworker Zsolt Csiszar is having lunch with his wife. He calls the bicycle park embarrassing and the anti-Brussels billboard campaign cringeworthy. But he does not expect EU leaders to punish Hungary. \"After Brexit, no chance,\" he says. \"They want to keep the EU together. They will let our prime minister do whatever he wants.\" Journalist Zsuzsanna Wirth contributed reporting.",

About five years ago, immigration attorneys started contacting Pennsylvania election officials to report that many of their clients had gone to get a driver's license and, a few weeks later, received a voter registration card in the mail. Sundrop Carter, executive director of the Pennsylvania Immigration and Citizenship Coalition, says it was especially disturbing for immigrants who were trying to become citizens. \" 'I received this in the mail, I don't know why,' \" she says they would tell their lawyers. \" 'I didn't think I was eligible to register to vote. Am I actually? Should I go vote?' \" The answer was definitely \"No.\" That would be illegal (noncitizens are not eligible to vote in federal elections, but a handful of jurisdictions allow them to vote in some local races). Since 1995, federal law has required states to offer people a chance to register to vote when they visit a local motor vehicle office. But it turns out that Pennsylvania, like some other states, was asking that question of everyone who applied for a driver's license or state ID card \u2014 even those showing green cards or other documents identifying them as noncitizens. That is often confusing for immigrants who come in to get a driver's license or ID, which noncitizens are eligible to do. The issue remains a challenge for states, especially as President Trump and other Republicans have alleged \u2014 without providing evidence \u2014 that tens of thousands, even millions, of noncitizens have illegally registered and voted in U.S. elections. Texas officials recently announced that 95,000 noncitizens appeared to be on that state's voter rolls. Those numbers have since been shown to be seriously flawed, but it hasn't stopped Trump from insisting such fraud is rampant. While claims of massive illegal voting by noncitizens have routinely been disproved, some noncitizens have ended up on the rolls, usually by accident. \"What is the 'vote,' what should I do?\" Immigrants like Asife, who lived in Pennsylvania on a student visa in the early 2000s, were confused by the process of getting a driver's license and accidentally registered to vote. (NPR is not using his full name because what he did was technically illegal, and he's concerned about the repercussions in his community.) \"When I come here, I have no English language at all, like I barely, like you know, have some words,\" he says. He didn't understand what the clerk was asking him, especially because Asife came from a country where elections are seldom held. \"The guy there didn't explain what is the 'vote,' what I should do? He just look at the screen and he told me, 'Okay, so answer this question.' And like I have no clue,\" says Asife. He signed the form and forgot about it until he applied for citizenship seven years later and learned he was illegally registered to vote. Asife never actually voted and was able to become a U.S. citizen. After hearing hundreds of similar stories, Pennsylvania officials realized they had a problem. They decided to change their system so that one of the first questions people are asked when applying for a driver's license is \"Are you a citizen?\" If the answer is no, applicants are never asked whether they want to register to vote. The forms are also available in 14 languages, instead of two. David Becker, executive director of the Center for Election Innovation & Research, says other states also accidentally register noncitizens. Sometimes it's just a misunderstanding between the motor vehicles department and election officials over whose job it is to verify citizenship. Small numbers of votes Becker says the number of noncitizens who end up on the rolls is relatively small and the number who actually vote is even smaller. Pennsylvania officials estimated that the noncitizens they identified cast 544 votes from 2000 through 2017, out of 93 million overall votes cast. \"Again, a tiny drop in the bucket compared to the eligible voter population, but clearly something we want to avoid,\" says Becker. He notes that noncitizens can face serious legal action \u2014 several dozen have been prosecuted recently in North Carolina and Texas. It also undermines public trust and opens the way for allegations \u2014 even unfounded ones \u2014 of voter fraud. \"My concern is it risks jeopardizing confidence in the electoral process,'\" California Secretary of State Alex Padilla said last fall when it emerged that some 1,500 individuals, including noncitizens, had mistakenly been registered as part of his state's new automatic voter registration law. The registrations were canceled, but it raised questions about what other mistakes had been made. Padilla says the problem was trying to implement the new law \u2014 in which every eligible voter is registered unless they opt out \u2014 at the same time the California Department of Motor Vehicles was upgrading its entire system. West Virginia is now facing a similar challenge. It's supposed to start automatic voter registration at the Division of Motor Vehicles on July 1, but both election and DMV officials are seeking a delay. \"You get one day of voter registrations not coming through, we're headline news across the nation,\" Donald Kersey, general counsel for the secretary of state's office, warned lawmakers earlier this month. The state's DMV now relies on a mainframe computer that's more than 26 years old and needs to be updated. Kersey says there are already problems. Some legitimate registrations get lost, while noncitizens can get on the rolls. \"In the current system, the noncitizen can just say, or can misunderstand, and just say yeah, 'I'm eligible. I'm a U.S. citizen, I'm a West Virginia resident',\" says Kersey. \"They can, I'm not going to say lie, but they can make a mistake and say yes. And they get a voter registration card in the mail. They probably think they're allowed to vote now. And then they go vote and they committed a crime.\" Kersey says the numbers are tiny \u2014 the state is currently prosecuting only one noncitizen voter \u2014 but he says it's a concern when many local elections are decided by 10 votes or less. A bill to delay automatic voter registration for two years is making its way through the state legislature. It would also set up a new system to help ensure that those who do get registered are U.S. citizens.",

            "article_content": "Four months after an election dominated largely by the issue of immigration, Sweden has a government. Social Democrats and the prime minister hold on to power while the right-wing party is excluded.  DAVID GREENE, HOST: All right. If British politics have been a mess this week, Sweden has been without a government since September after an election delivered no clear winner. But this morning, the Swedish Parliament voted to give the previous prime minister, center-left Social Democrat Stefan Lofven, another four years in power. Maddy Savage has been following the story from outside the Swedish Parliament. MADDY SAVAGE, BYLINE: Sweden has been in limbo for four months after one of the tightest elections in history ended without a clear winner, partly due to the rise of a nationalist anti-immigration party, the Sweden Democrats. They took votes away from traditional parties on the center-right as well as the Social Democrats, who are on the center-left and have a very different agenda, despite their similar name. So it's been a complicated process as the different parties have tried to figure out who should lead a coalition government. Today, Stefan Lofven finally got enough support to do it. Here's the speaker of the Swedish Parliament, Andreas Norlen, announcing Lofven had won the vote. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) ANDREAS NORLEN: Stefan Lofven (foreign language spoken). (APPLAUSE) SAVAGE: What is important about this vote is that a number of smaller center-right parties essentially switched sides in order to help Stefan Lofven back into power. They said they'd tolerate a center-left coalition rather than risk a center-right government that would've relied on support from the hard-right nationalists. The prime minister has had to compromise, too. He said he'll cut taxes and relax the country's strict labor laws, moving away from his typical Social Democrat agenda, which many think is controversial. Here's Samuel Engblom, spokesperson for one of Sweden's largest trade union organizations, the TCO. SAMUEL ENGBLOM: Well, it's a good thing that we have a government. It's taking a longer time than usual in Sweden, a longer time than usual in most countries. We're worried that it will become more easy for employers to fire people for the wrong reasons, to circumvent dismissive protection legislation. SAVAGE: Opinion polls suggest that all of this has rocked confidence in politicians in general, and many people think the fragile new government is in for a rocky ride, which might end up helping the nationalists win even more support in the long run.

As U.S. immigration enforcement becomes stricter under the Trump administration, more immigrant families are cutting ties with health care services and other critical government programs, according to child advocates who work with these families. In Texas, researchers studying the issue say it's a major reason why more children are going without health insurance. Ana, who lives in Central Texas with her husband and two children, has been increasingly hesitant to seek help from the government. In particular, she's worried about getting help for her 9-year-old daughter, Sara, who was diagnosed with autism a few years ago. Ana entered the country without documentation about 10 years ago, which is why NPR has agreed not to use her last name. Both her children were born in the U.S. and have been covered by Medicaid for years. But ever since President Trump took office, Ana has only been using the program for basics \u2014 such as checkups and vaccinations for the kids. This decision to forgo care comes at a cost. Managing Sara's behavior has been challenging, even after the diagnosis brought some clarity about what was going on. Sara acts out and has tantrums, sometimes in public places. Ana finds it difficult to soothe her daughter, and it's become more awkward as Sara grows. \"To other people, Sara just seems spoiled or a brat,\" Ana says. After the diagnosis, Ana felt unsure about her next steps. She eventually went to a nonprofit in Austin that guides and supports parents whose children have disabilities. It's called Vela (\"candle\" in Spanish). At Vela, Ana learned about a range of services Sara could get access to via her Medicaid plan \u2014 including therapy to help the child communicate better. However, the thought of asking for more government services for her daughter increased Ana's anxiety. \"I am looking for groups who are not associated with the government,\" Ana explains. Ana is in the middle of the long, expensive legal process of applying for permanent resident status, known informally as a \"green card.\" Recently, the Trump administration announced that it may tighten part of this process \u2013 the \"public charge\" assessment. The assessment scrutinizes how many government services a green card applicant currently uses \u2014 or might use later in life. If a person uses many government services, they could pose a net financial burden on the federal budget \u2014 or so goes the rationale. The government's algorithms are complex, but \"public charge\" is part of the determination for who gets a green card and who doesn't. The rule change proposed by the Trump administration \u2014 which may not come to pass \u2014 has already led many applicants, or would-be applicants, to be wary of all government services, even those that wouldn't affect their applications. \"I am afraid they will not give me a legal resident status,\" Ana says. Her husband already has a green card, and the couple is determined to not jeopardize Ana's ongoing application. So they have decided \u2014 just to be safe \u2014 to avoid seeking any more help from the government. That's even though their daughter, who is a citizen, needs more therapy than she's getting right now. \"I feel bad that I have to do that,\" Ana says. She says she would love to treat her daughter's autism, but has decided that there is nothing more important than getting that green card, in order to keep the family together in the U.S. \"I'm running into families that, when it's time for re-enrollment or reapplication, they are pausing and they are questioning if they should,\" says Nadine Rueb, a clinical social worker dealing with Ana's case at Vela. Rueb says a range of fears are behind immigrants avoidance of government services. Some are staying under the radar to avoid immediate deportation. Others are more like Ana \u2014 they just want to be in the best position possible to finally get permanent legal status and move on with their lives. \"The climate of fear is so pervasive at this point, and there is so much misinformation out there,\" says Cheasty Anderson, a senior policy associate with the Children's Defense Fund in Texas. Anderson thinks the parents' fears have led to an uptick in children going without health coverage in Texas. A recent study from Georgetown University's Center for Children and Families found that one out of every five uninsured kids in the U.S. lives in Texas. And a big percentage of those uninsured children are Latino. The report shows that after years of steady decline, the number (and percentage) of uninsured children in the U.S. increased in 2017, the first year of Trump's presidency. Nationally, 5 percent of all kids are uninsured \u2014 and in Texas the rate rose to 10.7 percent, up from 9.8 percent in 2016. Joan Alker, the author of the Georgetown report, says the Trump administration's effort to crack down on both legal and illegal immigration is one of many factors driving up the uninsured rates. And it's especially perceptible in Texas, where a quarter of children have a parent who is either undocumented, or who is trying to become a legal resident. \"For these mixed-status families, there is likely a heightened fear of interacting with the government, and this may be deterring them from signing up their eligible children up for government-sponsored health care,\" Alker said in a phone call with reporters in November, when the report was released. Anderson says the repercussions fall hardest on kids with disabilities \u2014 kids who need services. \"Texas is proud to be Texas in so many ways, but this is one way in which we are failing ourselves,\" she says. From the perspective of Rueb, a disability rights specialist, timing is an essential issue for these children. \"The sooner you catch [the diagnosis or condition], the sooner you support the child [and] the sooner you support the family,\" Rueb says. \"I think it's just a win-win for everybody. You are supporting the emotions of the family, and then that supports the child.\" For now, Ana says she's relying on the services offered by her daughter's public school \u2014 which aren't counted in the federal government's \"public charge\" assessment. And she'll keep doing that until she gets that green card. This story is part of NPR's reporting partnership with KUT and Kaiser Health News.",

            "article_content": "Tens of thousands of migrants cross north out of the U.S. each year, hoping they'll have a better chance of being granted asylum. The journey takes them all to one dead-end road in Upstate New York.  LULU GARCIA-NAVARRO, HOST: A nondescript country lane in upstate New York has become one of the most popular routes for asylum-seekers trying to get into Canada. But many face steep legal hurdles if they make it to the other side of the northern border. Emma Jacobs reports on a new legal battle over immigration in Canada. EMMA JACOBS, BYLINE: It's after dark when a taxi drives past bungalows and horse pastures to where rocks and road dead ends at the Quebec border. The woman who gets out is originally from Haiti. UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN: (Non-English language spoken). JACOBS: A Canadian police officer introduces himself from across a strip of gravel. UNIDENTIFIED POLICE OFFICER: (Non-English language spoken). JACOBS: \"This is not an official crossing point,\" he says. \"If she proceeds to Canada here, she will be arrested.\" The woman crosses anyway. She's been living in Philadelphia with her three young boys and wants to ask for asylum in Canada, but she can't apply at an official border crossing because of a longstanding agreement between the U.S. and Canada. Wendy Ayotte, a Canadian volunteer, has watched asylum seekers from all over the world across this way. WENDY AYOTTE: I think if I were in their shoes crossing into the unknown, being arrested and all of that, I would want somebody to be a friendly face, you know? JACOBS: Ayotte has been coming here Sunday afternoons for more than two years now to hand out hats and gloves and to wish the newcomers good luck. AYOTTE: Bon courage. JACOBS: Before President Trump's election, Ayotte says, migrants crossed here infrequently. Since 2017, more than 40,000 people have walked across the border here. According to a University of Toronto survey, nearly half of these migrants had been living in the U.S. but left because they feared deportation under the Trump administration. The rest were fleeing their native countries and believed they had a better chance of getting asylum in Canada than in the U.S. All of them ended up here at this dead-end road in upstate New York. AYOTTE: It was really awkward 'cause it went down into a bit of a ditch. And there was walks. And, you know, people were trying to drive their suitcases over (laughter). JACOBS: Ayotte says, eventually, Canadian authorities filled the ditch with gravel. There have been other changes, too. A corrugated metal building went up last spring. Officers now staff that building full time to search and process people, says Cpl. Charles Poirier of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police. CHARLES POIRIER: There has been a continuous flow of people crossing, and that's why we're still there. JACOBS: Many asylum seekers are here because of the Safe Third Country Agreement that the U.S. and Canada signed in 2002. It was designed to prevent what's known as asylum shopping by requiring migrants to apply in whichever country they arrived in first, but it only applies at official border crossings. David Gervais is an immigration attorney in Plattsburgh, N.Y. DAVID GERVAIS: I've seen people, whole families get turned around on the Canadian side. And they get arrested on the way back. JACOBS: These migrants may have been living in the U.S. illegally and were seeking protection in Canada, and now they're arrested by American border officers for not having papers. Gervais remembers a recent case. GERVAIS: They arrested dad. They didn't arrest mom because they had young kids with them. But dad was arrested. And he was eventually sent to the Federal Detention Center in Batavia, N.Y. And he was held there for deportation proceedings. JACOBS: Canadian immigration advocates are upset about these long detentions. They've sued to overturn the Safe Third Country Agreement. They argued before a Toronto federal court in November that the U.S. is not safe for asylum seekers and denies asylum to migrants who would be protected in Canada. The Canadian government pointed out the U.S. does accept tens of thousands of asylum seekers each year. A ruling could take several months. For NPR News, I'm Emma Jacobs in Montreal.

            "article_content": "Immigration networks throughout California have set up hotlines to provide legal aid to undocumented immigrants as President Trump threatens to ramp up deportations.  MICHEL MARTIN, HOST: We're going to begin today's program looking at how two of the week's biggest stories are affecting people's lives. In a few minutes, we'll hear what Iranian Americans in Southern California are telling their community news outlets about the escalating tensions between the U.S. and Iran. But first, we'll look at immigration. Yesterday, President Trump delayed proposed nationwide ICE raids, he says to give the Congress time to come up with a broader immigration plan. Earlier today, he tweeted, \"I want to give the Democrats every last chance to quickly negotiate simple changes to asylum and loopholes\" - unquote. He added, two weeks, and big deportation begins. In the Bay Area, advocates and local governments have been preparing for something like this for years, building legal aid to help immigrants defend themselves from deportation. From member station KQED, Farida Jhabvala Romero has this report. FARIDA JHABVALA ROMERO, BYLINE: Across California, two dozen rapid response networks have hotlines where anyone can call to report an arrest by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents. For example... HAMID YAZDAN PANAH: Someone that was presumably at home or on their way to school, and they're picked up by a number of agents in, you know, an unmarked vehicle, and they're whisked away from their family. ROMERO: Hamid Yazdan Panah helps coordinate the networks from Kern County, north of Los Angeles, all the way to the Oregon border. He says those networks have dispatched immigration attorneys to consult with hundreds of migrants arrested by ICE. PANAH: The rapid response networks - they're about building a bridge between attorneys and organizers and the community members and encouraging folks to not live in fear. ROMERO: An ICE spokesman declined to say whether the agency would be conducting a large operation in California. But in a statement, he said ICE will continue to, quote, \"conduct interior enforcement without exemption for those who are in violation of federal immigration law.\" President Trump has threatened mass immigration arrests before. After his election, San Francisco and other counties began spending millions of dollars to expand legal representation for immigrants who can't afford an attorney. FRANCISCO UGARTE: Most of our clients have been in the United States for more than 10 years. Most of them have a U.S. citizen relative, whether it's a spouse or child. ROMERO: Francisco Ugarte manages the Immigration Defense Unit with eight attorneys at the San Francisco Public Defenders Office. They represent people in ICE detention who are fighting their cases in San Francisco's immigration court, which covers a big part of the state. UGARTE: We've been successful in helping those clients get released from custody about 50% of the time ROMERO: Ugarte says his office is prepared to step up if ICE begins massive arrests. UGARTE: We will not stand by idly if there's is a raid in our community. ROMERO: But other parts of the state don't have as many immigration attorneys standing by. JENNAYA DUNLAP: Because we don't have a lot of resources in terms of money to pay for everything, we do rely a lot on volunteers. ROMERO: Jennaya Dunlap is the only paid staffer at the Inland Empire Emergency Response Network, which covers all of San Bernardino and Riverside Counties in Southern California. DUNLAP: One of the big differences in our region is, unlike a metropolitan area such as LA or Orange County, folks are, like, wide spread out, and so getting information out isn't as easy. ROMERO: She says they have a lot to handle. Being close to the border, both ICE and Border Patrol are targeting and arresting people in the Inland Empire. To beef up legal services for immigrants across California, the state legislature has proposed $65 million in the most recent budget awaiting Governor Gavin Newsom's signature. That's double what the state spent in 2016, before President Trump was elected. For NPR News, I'm Farida Jhabvala Romero. Copyright \u00a9 2019 NPR.  All rights reserved.

            "article_content": "It's Day 11 of the partial government shutdown, and there's no end in sight. Russian authorities arrest an American on spying charges. North Korea's leader has given his annual New Year's Day address.  RACHEL MARTIN, HOST: It is up to a new Congress in this new year to resolve a government shutdown. Roughly 800,000 federal employees are unsure when they'll be paid. President Trump demanded $5 billion to help build a wall on the border with Mexico. Democrats offered less for various border security measures. The president told Fox News last night he's ready to talk. (SOUNDBITE OF FOX NEWS BROADCAST) PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: So I'm ready to go any time they want. No, we are not giving up. We have to have border security, and the wall is a big part of border security - the biggest part. MARTIN: The president spoke amid confusion about what he really wants. His outgoing chief of staff, John Kelly, said the administration ditched the idea of an actual wall a long time ago, instead favoring fences, technology and more border guards. NPR's White House reporter Ayesha Rascoe joins us now. Ayesha. AYESHA RASCOE, BYLINE: Good morning. MARTIN: Happy New Year. RASCOE: Happy New Year. (Laughter). MARTIN: I'm assuming you, like me, did not go out and party it up last night 'cause we had to talk about the news this morning. So thanks for making the sacrifice. RASCOE: (Laughter). Yeah. MARTIN: Democrats - let's get right to it. Democrats and Republicans have been stuck in this stalemate for a long time now. Thursday, Democrats take control of the House. What's expected to change? RASCOE: Well, at this point it doesn't look like much will change. But you will finally have some concrete action where, up until now, we've had a lot of talk. So Democrats plan to put forward legislation that would fund the government. Basically, it will provide, like, a year of funding for most of the departments and agencies that are currently shut down. For the Department of Homeland Security, which is at the center of this wall fight, it would provide this stopgap spending bill. And that would basically just push the issue back to February. But this does not include any wall or barrier funding. So it's not clear it's going to go anywhere. Trump is saying you cannot have border security without a wall. And Republicans in the Senate say they won't bring up anything that Trump doesn't support. So it seems like this impasse will remain, even if Democrats pass their bill in the House on Thursday. MARTIN: I mean, what leverage is even left for either party? RASCOE: Well, so right now it seems like the White House wants to use the shutdown to pressure the Democrats to come to the table. Basically, you have all of these people out of work. Something has to be done. President Trump is arguing that the government needs to be reopened and that Democrats need to show that they're concerned about border security. But he's making this case at the Democrats with Democrats set to take over the House after they gained all these seats in an election where Trump made immigration a top issue. So his leverage is not what it would have been before the midterm elections. Democrats, of course, say they're offering money for border security, just not for a wall, and - which they don't see as effective. And they see it as a symbol of what they oppose about President Trump's immigration policies. And Democrats have their own base that they're trying to play to. And basically, they're arguing President Trump said he would own the shutdown. He said that Mexico would pay for the wall. And that - that's their argument that they're making. And so they're trying to move ahead without any funding for the barrier - I mean, for a barrier or for a wall. But ultimately, something is going to have to give. The question is who is going to do the giving... MARTIN: Right. RASCOE: ...And what it might look like. They need each other at this point, the president and the Democrats. They're going to have to come together on something. MARTIN: Right. So I guess if we thought it was tough for the last Congress to get anything done, 2019's going to be a doozy, right? RASCOE: It - it will. There won't be - there's no shortage of areas of disagreement. And there's going to be a lot of things that they're just going to bump heads on. And this is an example of the start of it. MARTIN: All right, NPR White House reporter Ayesha Rascoe with the latest. Thanks so much, lady, we appreciate it. RASCOE: Thank you. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) MARTIN: Now to Russia, where an American citizen has been detained. The FSB - that's the Russian security service - says that Paul Whelan was taken into custody late last week on suspicion of espionage. Here in Washington, the U.S. State Department put out a short statement saying essentially that they're just aware of the arrest. This comes weeks after a Russian operative was convicted of conspiracy here in the U.S., trying to influence U.S. policy ahead of the 2016 presidential election. For more, we've got NPR's Lucian Kim on the line with us from Moscow. Lucian, Happy New Year. LUCIAN KIM, BYLINE: Happy New Year. Good morning. MARTIN: Any new details? Good morning. Any new details come out about this arrest yet? KIM: Well, not really. All we have is this very terse statement from the FSB that was issued yesterday. And it basically named this American citizen, identified as Paul Whelan, who was arrested, quote, \"in the act of spying in Moscow\" last Friday. And we know that a criminal investigation for espionage has been opened. As you mentioned, there's also the State Department's statement from yesterday - also very terse - saying the U.S. is aware of the detention and expects Russia to follow its obligations under international conventions. What that means is providing access to this individual by U.S. Embassy officials. But we don't know anything about this person except the name given by the FSB. And the State Department is not commenting due to what it calls privacy considerations. MARTIN: So I mean, it's hard to ignore the fact that this arrest is coming really close after this Russian national, Maria Butina, pled guilty to conspiring to act as a Russian agent and basically infiltrate American political groups. I mean, are these connected? It would seem real weird if they're not. KIM: Well, of course there's a lot of speculation right now that this might be a Russian response to Butina's detention and plea deal and that this American citizen accused of espionage may be used to swap out Butina. President Vladimir Putin has been asked about her. And he's said that she was forced to make a confession to U.S. prosecutors because he maintains she never had any Russian government duties. He's also said the charges against her are baseless and that he's not indifferent to her case. What's interesting is at the same time, he said that Russia will not arrest innocent people just to use them as bargaining chips. MARTIN: So we also remember last year - right? - Russia expelled 60 U.S. diplomats after the Trump administration kicked out 60 Russian diplomats. So this has been going on for a while. As we look down the pike at 2019, what's the state of the relationship between the U.S. and Russia? KIM: Well, just about those diplomats - at the time, the Trump administration indicated that those Russians it expelled were intelligence officers working under diplomatic cover. And of course, the arrest last week is not the best way to end the year. MARTIN: Right. KIM: In February we expect the Trump administration to withdraw from a 1987 arms control treaty that the U.S. says Russia is violating. President Trump also doesn't look like he will meet President Putin anytime soon because it looks like the White House has made that - a future meeting contingent on Russia releasing two dozen - two dozen Ukrainian navy sailors that it's captured. Of course, in the U.S. we have the Mueller investigation grinding on. We have the Democrats taking over the House. And these are - of course are also factors that will affect U.S.-Russia relations. So unfortunately, not a lot of bright spots looking forward into this new year. MARTIN: All right, buckle up. NPR's Lucian Kim from Moscow. Thanks so much, Lucian. KIM: Thank you, Rachel. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) MARTIN: All right, we're going to turn now to North Korea, where Kim Jong Un, North Korea's leader, has given his annual new year's address. And in this televised speech, Un says he remains committed to complete denuclearization but only if the U.S. keeps its promises. Kim Jong Un also said he'd be willing to meet with President Trump again, anytime. NPR's Anthony Kuhn joins us now from Seoul. Anthony, happy 2019. ANTHONY KUHN, BYLINE: Happy 2019, Rachel. MARTIN: So just from that snapshot I gave, it doesn't seem like Kim Jong Un is paving the way for a breakthrough on the nuclear issue, does it? KUHN: No, not at all. The speech was pretty much what analysts expected - especially those analysts who predict that this stalemate on the nuclear issue is going to drag on well into the new year. What Kim said is that, you know, he's serious about improving relations with the U.S. and denuclearizing. But North Korea's been pointing out for a while that since the Trump-Kim summit in June, they have made gestures such as dismantling nuclear and missile test sites. And so now it's up to the U.S. to reciprocate by easing sanctions or providing some sort of security guarantee. And there is an or-else. Let's hear some tape from Kim's speech here. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) LEADER KIM JONG UN: (Speaking Korean). KUHN: \"If the U.S. fails to keep the promises it made before the world,\" he says, \"if it misjudges the patience of our people and continues to use sanctions and pressure against our republic, then we'll have no choice except to seek a new path to secure the sovereignty and interests of our country.\" Now, he didn't say what exactly that new path is, Rachel, but it sounds a lot like the old path of hostility and confrontation with the U.S. - except now with a more lethal nuclear arsenal. And also, we might note that the setting for this, the scene for this speech was different. He was sitting in a wood-paneled, bookshelf-lined office, which was apparently intended to look more like a president's office than a dictator's bunker. MARTIN: Does he have a wood-paneled, bookshelf-lined office? Or is that a stage set? (Laughter). KUHN: We don't know. MARTIN: Unclear. KUHN: I've never been in his office. MARTIN: (Laughter). So what's he holding out for? KUHN: Well, you remember the Trump-Kim summit in June. People saw right then that that was the vaguest of deals and that the U.S. and North Korea have completely different understandings of denuclearization. And they have, you know, emphasized this time and again, that when they say denuclearization, that includes getting rid of the U.S. nuclear umbrella that protects South Korea and Japan. And today, Kim added in his speech, you know, no new strategic weapons on the Korean Peninsula and an end to U.S.-South Korean joint military exercises. So it seems that North Korea is holding out for another summit where they're going to try to squeeze more concessions out of President Trump. MARTIN: Meanwhile, south, in South Korea, the U.S. and the South were supposed to strike this new deal on the U.S. military presence. And this was supposed to happen by New Year's Eve. And it didn't happen, right? KUHN: Right. MARTIN: So what's going on there? KUHN: Well, the White House wants all allies to pay more. According to South Korean media, they're asking Seoul for a 50 percent increase. And they want to cut their five-year agreements down to just one so that they strike a deal with South Korea, and then they ask all other allies for similar terms. And South Korea has said no. Seoul was not happy about the U.S. pullout from Syria. And they're also worried about the resignation of Mattis, who tried to reassure allies, including South Korea, that he wouldn't either - the U.S. wouldn't pull out, and they also wouldn't attack North Korea without consulting with them first. MARTIN: All right, NPR's Anthony Kuhn from Seoul, reporting on Kim Jong Un's annual address. Anthony, we appreciate it. KUHN: No problem. Take care, Rachel. MARTIN: Take care.

            "article_content": "President Trump kept up his criticism of four Democratic congresswomen at a rally in North Carolina on Wednesday, where the crowd at one point shouted, \"Send her back,\" in reference to one lawmaker.  MARY LOUISE KELLY, HOST: And President Trump has just wrapped up a campaign rally in North Carolina; his first rally since he attacked four freshmen Democratic congresswomen of color on Twitter over the weekend. And Trump kept up his criticism tonight. NPR's Ayesha Rascoe has been at tonight's rally. She joins me now from Greenville, N.C. And, Ayesha, I want to start with what the president said about these four congresswomen - Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, Rashida Tlaib, Ayanna Pressley, Ilhan Omar. What did he say tonight? AYESHA RASCOE, BYLINE: This was a whole section of his speech. He called each lawmaker by name and then went through a list of accusations and attacks. He painted them as anti-American and radical. Omar received the most intense attacks from Trump. Here's a bit of what he said. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Omar has a history of launching vicious, anti-Semitic screeds. UNIDENTIFIED CROWD: (Chanting) Send her back. Send her back. Send her back. Send her back. RASCOE: So you may not be able to hear exactly what they're chanting, but that was the crowd saying, send her back. They were echoing Trump's racist language from tweets last weekend. Omar is a U.S. citizen. Omar has faced some controversy over some comments she's made about Israel, but she says she is not anti-Semitic. Trump is really trying to make these four women - I should note - who are all women of color, the face of the Democratic Party. And the crowd tonight was really into it. They were shouting traitor. Someone yelled, they're evil. In response to all of this, Omar tweeted a quote from Maya Angelou, saying, you may kill me with your hatefulness but still, like air, I'll rise. KELLY: I mean, I have to ask you just before we move on. You've been to your share of Trump rallies, Ayesha. How did this one compare? Did it feel different? RASCOE: It felt a little bit different. The crowd was very into it, but the chant - the send them back and the real just anger at these lawmakers stood out. KELLY: Yeah. This rally, as we mentioned - this is a campaign rally. It's part of the president's reelection campaign. Did he say anything about the Democrats who are actually running against him for president? RASCOE: Well, he bashed former Vice President Joe Biden for his performance during the first debate a few weeks ago. Here's what Trump said about Biden. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) TRUMP: They have a new one who knocked the hell out of Biden during a debate. He said, I wasn't prepared for that question. That's not a good answer. RASCOE: And he also went after Elizabeth Warren, doing his usual bit - mocking her claims about having Native American ancestry. And for Bernie Sanders - he said that Bernie Sanders had missed his chance last time in 2016, I guess, to get the nomination. He also claimed that Sanders is promising voters free health care and college, but he said he won't be able to deliver. KELLY: Now, you have been there reporting in Greenville, N.C., these last couple of days. What are you hearing from people here in terms of how they view events of these last few days? RASCOE: Well, it's interesting because even though, obviously, this rally was - there were a lot of supporters for President Trump. The town of Greenville, actually - and the county; Pitt County - did not go for President Trump in the last election. Before the rally, I talked to the pastor of a historic African American church in Greenville. It was founded after the Civil War. And - interim Pastor Kenneth Hammond. And what he said is that these words from Trump telling people to go back from where they came from - that it's undeniably racist and that it's offensive. And I talked to an advocate for the Latino community here, and he talked about how schoolchildren have had to deal with these exact same sorts of insults since Trump got elected and that after the election, that schoolchildren who are immigrants... KELLY: Right. RASCOE: ...Were being told that they're going to have to go back to their country. KELLY: NPR White House reporter Ayesha Rascoe, talking about the range of views she's encountering there in Greenville, N.C. Thank you, Ayesha. RASCOE: Thank you. Copyright \u00a9 2019 NPR.

            "article_content": "President Trump returned from a trip to the border as negotiations to end the partial government shutdown appear stalled. The president may declare a national emergency to get a border wall built.  DAVID GREENE, HOST: Today the partial government shutdown has hit a record. It is now tied for the longest shutdown in U.S. history. And it's almost certain to set a new record as the longest ever, with chances of a breakthrough in talks seeming more remote than ever. In fact, President Trump appears ready to declare a national emergency in order to sidestep Congress and build a border wall. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: I have the absolute right to declare a national emergency, the lawyers have so advised me. I'm not prepared to do that yet. But if I have to, I will. I have no doubt about it. I will. This is a crisis. GREENE: All right. We have NPR congressional correspondent Susan Davis in the studio with us. Good morning, Sue. SUSAN DAVIS, BYLINE: Good morning. GREENE: OK, so it seems like a stalemate - not much action. But there's been some action on Capitol Hill to try and reopen the government, right? So what is happening, and why are there - the hope's pretty dim that it'll mean anything? DAVIS: There had been a flurry of activity this week, particularly in the Senate, among senators who thought they might be able to come up with a compromise to put forward to the president and to Democrats. They've kind of abandoned ship on that. One of the senators involved in that effort is Lindsey Graham, a Republican from South Carolina. And he essentially came out publicly yesterday and said, I do not see any path forward for a deal; the only way out of this is for President Trump to declare a national emergency - and essentially encouraged him to do so. GREENE: OK, so this national emergency - I mean, I have so much to ask you here. I mean, there are questions about whether the president has legal authority to do this. But this may actually be an opening to get government workers back to work, right? DAVIS: It could in theory. If the president declares an emergency and says he's going to marshal resources to build the wall and sidestep Congress, it could allow them to reopen government because it would take the wall issue out of the budget debate. It does create, however, an entirely separate legal question of, would it be challenged in the courts? Would it be held up in the courts? You know, would it - would they have to pause until the court would weigh in on this? And also this question of executive overreach, which has been, for most Republicans on Capitol Hill, a really big concern in recent years. Particularly, it's something that they accused President Obama of doing - of essentially sidestepping the legislative branch to enact policy that Congress simply hasn't approved. GREENE: Oh, interesting. So Republicans could be in a weird spot where Democrats would be saying you complained about this with Obama for eight years; look at what your president is doing. DAVIS: And they would likely stand behind President Trump on this as they have on most issues even when they feel uncomfortable about it. GREENE: But so if he goes ahead and declares this emergency, you're saying this could become, like, a prolonged legal battle. And it's not clear if an actual emergency could go into place until the courts actually addressed it. DAVIS: That's right. And it's weird because I don't think there is a dispute that the president has broad powers when he declares a national emergency. They gave - he has this power for reasons. But often when the president has invoked these powers, it has been after 9/11 or after Hurricane Katrina - moments when, I think, the country as a whole recognized we were in a state of emergency, and there was no dispute to invoking those powers. GREENE: We've been talking about our current state of politics - the tribalism... DAVIS: Yeah. GREENE: ...The anger, the partisanship, the gridlock. I mean, this feels like it's a new moment - to sort of take stock of that - if the only way out of a debate over how to open the government is to have a president declaring an emergency. DAVIS: I also think it goes to the symbolism of the wall. There's so much about this debate that isn't really a policy fight. It's really a political fight. And it's a political knife fight, increasingly. And the White House and his advisers see the wall - if he gives up on the wall, if he walks away from that, it will so dispirit his base that it could cripple his presidency. Senator Lindsey Graham has said as much. On the other end, Democrats just won a big election in which the president weaponized immigration and the border in the closing weeks of the campaign. And Democrats won big, and they took control of the House. And they see the public on their side. And they see no reason to compromise with the president, knowing what it could mean for him if he loses on the wall. GREENE: And one other thing to note in news out of Congress - we have the president's former lawyer Michael Cohen who's going to be testifying on Capitol Hill next month it's sounding like now. That could be interesting. DAVIS: It will be the first in what is expected to be a year of high-profile intense hearings from Capitol Hill now that Democrats are in control. They have oversight authority. They have subpoena power. They intend to use it. We know much of what Michael Cohen has said, but most of it - it has been read. He was into the courts, and it was not on television. He will have a chance to testify publicly. And he issued a statement, noting yesterday, he is coming up voluntarily. And he is looking eager to talk to Congress. GREENE: NPR's Susan Davis. Sue, thanks. DAVIS: You're welcome. Copyright \u00a9 2019 NPR.  All rights reserved.

Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., speaks to supporters at an Iowa rally in March.\n                \n                    \n                    Nati Harnik/AP\n                    \n                \nhide caption Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., speaks to supporters at an Iowa rally in March. This weekend, one of the most high-profile Latinas in Congress, Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, is campaigning for Bernie Sanders in Nevada and California. Recent polls by the Los Angeles Times, The New York Times and Latino Decisions all show Sanders as the top Democratic presidential candidate choice among Latino Democrats. He has a particular strength with young Latinos. The story of how a man who represents one of the whitest states in the country \u2014 Vermont \u2014 came to resonate with the largest nonwhite eligible voting block in the country is multifaceted. Interviews with Sanders' campaign staff, volunteers, voters and activists in the key early voting state of Nevada point to a few consistent factors that explain the senator's popularity: his consistency on jobs and health care, his progressive immigration plan, his campaign outreach in Latino neighborhoods, his appeal with young people broadly (the median age for Latinos in the country is 28) and the intentional hiring of Latino staff (his campaign says it has more than 100 Latino staffers across the country). \"T\u00edo Bernie\" Shawn Navarro, a 33-year-old Sanders volunteer in Las Vegas, refers to his favorite presidential candidate as \"T\u00edo Bernie.\" \"He reminds us a lot in the Latinx community of your grandpa, or your t\u00edo,\" explained Navarro after a recent Spanish-language campaign event in Nevada. \"He's kind of stern, a little grumpy at times. But, at the same time, you really know he's looking out for you.\" Latinos, Navarro says, are tired of listening to talking points from Democrats who come to their neighborhoods, \"speak a little bit of Spanish\" and \"eat tacos,\" but then don't deliver any real results. It's why, he says, exit polls found that Donald Trump and Mitt Romney, \"who was far less offensive,\" performed roughly equally with Latinos in the 2016 and 2012 elections. \"There is a huge distrust among the Latinx community with the Democratic party that they're not following through on their promises,\" Navarro said. \"Bernie is the exact opposite. He has a real authenticity.\" It's a point many Sanders supporters echo. Risky strategy, with an upside Early in this campaign cycle, a common narrative emerged in which Joe Biden was seen as the clear frontrunner for a generic group dubbed \"voters of color.\" In reality, the former vice president has a groundswell of support with African Americans, but his support with Latinos is far shakier. Although Biden has a clear polling advantage with Latinos over the age of 50 and has received high-profile endorsements from lawmakers within the Congressional Hispanic Caucus, Sanders has also fiercely courted Latino voters on the ground. Months ago, his campaign manager Faiz Shakir told NPR he sees Latinos as a key constituency in building a winning coalition. Matt Barreto, co-founder of the polling firm Latino Decisions, says Sanders' strength with Latinos is driven by voters under the age 30. \"But he also does pretty well with Latinos age 30 to 50,\" Barreto added. \"Latinos are the youngest population in the United States. That's where a bulk of the Latino electorate is, and so focusing on those younger voters is a smart idea.\" But it's also a risky strategy \u2014 based on the assumption that Sanders can turn out young voters en masse and translate that support to their parents and grandparents. But it's also a strategy with potentially a huge upside for Sanders \u2014 it could help him put a dent in Biden's path to the nomination. Latinos have a more influential role in the primaries this year because of the way the calendar is drawn. The two most populous states in the country \u2014 California and Texas \u2014 vote on the first Tuesday in March. And in both states, about 40% of the population is Latino. \"Meeting Latinos where they are\" Activists in Nevada say the Sanders campaign actively began field operations in the state earlier than many rival campaigns. Even those who are not endorsing Sanders acknowledge the strength of the senator's operation. They say they've personally witnessed his campaign working in predominantly Latino neighborhoods for months. \"We are seeing them meeting Latinos where they are ... knocking on their doors, you know, going to places where they're shopping,\" said Cecia Alvarado, the Nevada state director of Mi Familia Vota. The group is not endorsing a presidential candidate, but has opened its office as a meeting space to all of the candidates. \"The most active at the moment is Sen. Sanders,\" she added. Benjamin Garcia, a day laborer who also works on immigration issues with the group Arriba Las Vegas, says Sanders is the only candidate he has consistently received campaign literature from in the mail. Garcia, who spoke in Spanish at the Arriba storefront office, said he's focused on finding a candidate who aligns with his priorities on immigration. Behind him as he spoke were posters that declared \"not one more deportation\" and \"protect TPS.\" \"With Sanders, I feel that he's seeing us an immigrant community and listening to us,\" said Garcia. Sanders first met with the group in October. The group has also met with Elizabeth Warren, Cory Booker and Julian Castro, but has not endorsed a candidate. Bliss Requa-Trautz, the director of Arriba, said voters are frustrated with the lack of congressional action on immigration. And perhaps part of Sanders' appeal to some of her members is that he's promising change through liberal executive action, rather than traditional congressional legislation. Sanders immigration plan calls for a slew of sweeping changes, including, notably, a moratorium on all deportations and a stop to the construction of a border wall. He also promises to use executive authority to allow all undocumented immigrants who have lived in the United States for at least five years to remain in the country with no threat of deportation. And he intends to break up Immigration and Customs Enforcement. Biden differs \u2014 he has not endorsed the idea of decriminalizing the border or halting all deportations. It's a shift from the more centrist political debate in the Democratic party and even a shift from Sanders own views on immigration. In 2007, he voted against a comprehensive immigration bill, siding with labor unions over concerns about a guest worker program in the bill. But it goes further than many other candidates in protecting undocumented immigrants and might help explain his growing appeal with Latinos. Trying to be \"culturally relevant\" Michael Ramirez, deputy Nevada field director, and Susana Cervantes, Nevada field director, say having Latino staffers gives the campaign an advantage. The Sanders campaign says it has more than 100 Latino staffers across the country.\n                \n                    \n                    Asma Khalid/NPR\n                    \n                \nhide caption Michael Ramirez, deputy Nevada field director, and Susana Cervantes, Nevada field director, say having Latino staffers gives the campaign an advantage. The Sanders campaign says it has more than 100 Latino staffers across the country. The first office Sanders opened in Nevada was in East Las Vegas, a predominantly Latino section of the city. On a recent Sunday evening at the office, volunteers dialed potential caucusgoers, fluently switching their pitch between English and Spanish. The state's field director Susana Cervantes and deputy field director Michael Ramirez are Latino. That sheer fact, Ramirez says, gives them an advantage. \"[It] gives a unique perspective and understanding about how to campaign and how to do it differently,\" said Cervantes. She says the campaign uses traditional campaign tactics, such as phone banking and canvassing. But it's also consciously trying to be \"culturally relevant.\" \"For example, we had a d\u00eda de los muertos event where we had games for the kids [and] we played the movie Coco,\" Ramirez said. Barreto with Latino Decisions says it's not surprising to see Sanders doing well with Latinos. \"And the reason is if you go to the start of his 2020 campaign, he brought in a number of high profile and senior advisers to his Latino campaign,\" he said. According to Barreto, staff diversity has been key to Sanders' success. He recalls how Sanders was widely criticized in 2016 for running a class-focused campaign that, at times, overlooked race/culture. This time, the Vermont senator is running a campaign that tries to include immigration and race within its broader economic message. But more than policy, Barreto thinks Latinos are looking for a candidate they can trust. It's about familiarity. \"It really is a lot about positioning yourself, making yourself look welcoming, open,\" he said. That is why, he says, Sanders and Biden are the top two choices for most Latino voters.",

Off Script, a new NPR series about presidential hopefuls, gives voters the chance to sit down with candidates and get answers to their questions. In this first installment of Off Script with NPR's Lulu Garcia-Navarro, two undecided Texas voters sit down with Juli\u00e1n Castro, former secretary of the Department of Housing and Urban Development, and ask him about immigration and climate change. (Watch the immigration conversation in the video above, the climate change one below. You can also watch a longer version of the conversation here.) They met in San Antonio at Mi Tierra, a restaurant with a lot of history for Castro. He is featured in a mural on the wall and it's also where he took his wife on their first date. Dani Marrero Hi, an immigration rights organizer, is a registered Democrat who voted for Hillary Clinton in the 2016 election. Born and raised in border cities in both Mexico and Texas, she supports Castro's opposition to border wall construction, but she wants more clarity on other aspects of his border policies before he gets her vote \u2014 like whether he'd come to help escort migrants cross the border to Brownsville, Texas, and how he'd change the asylum-seeking process. Currently, the Trump administration's Migrant Protection Protocol policy requires that asylum-seekers live in Mexico to await a decision on their immigration claims. \"I would immediately issue an executive order ending the Migrant Protection Protocol or 'remain in Mexico' policy,\" Castro said. \"It's a disaster of a policy.\" Credit:  NPR Alston Beinhorn, the second voter, is a retired banker and rancher who also backed Clinton in 2016. Beinhorn says the hot Texas days have gotten much hotter since he started raising livestock in the 1970s, and that is unsustainable for animals and people who work outdoors. But curbing greenhouse gases is a hard sell among ranchers because cattle are a top contributor to the planet's methane problem. Beinhorn wants to know: How would Castro enlist the support of voters to change their minds on climate change when it's not immediately in their economic interest? Castro last month proposed a plan to combat climate change, which would recommit to the Paris climate accord, set a goal of getting to net-zero carbon emissions in the U.S. by 2045 and offer economic support for farmers to help meet climate goals. Then he says he can address \"this challenge of OK, well, are there sacrifices that we need to make,\" he says. \"I actually believe that we can both do right by our planet and also unleash a clean energy revolution in terms of jobs.\" Off Script is edited and produced for broadcast by Ashley Brown and Bridget De Chagas.

But a close read reveals some initiatives in Biden's plan that are so expansive they might have trouble passing even a Congress held by Democrats.\n                \n                    \n                    Justin Sullivan/Getty Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption Opponents running to Joe Biden's left say his health plan for America merely \"tinkers around the edges\" of the Affordable Care Act. But a close read reveals some initiatives in Biden's plan that are so expansive they might have trouble passing even a Congress held by Democrats. The headlines about presidential candidate Joe Biden's new health care plan called it \"a nod to the past\" and \"Affordable Care Act 2.0.\" That mostly refers to the fact that the former vice president has specifically repudiated many of his Democratic rivals' calls for a \"Medicare for All\" system, and instead sought to build his plan on the ACA's framework. Sen. Bernie Sanders, one of Biden's opponents in the primary race and the key proponent of the Medicare for All option, has criticized Biden's proposal, complaining that it is just \"tinkering around the edges\" of a broken health care system. Still, the proposal put forward by Biden earlier this week is much more ambitious than Obamacare \u2013 and despite its incremental label, would make some very controversial changes. \"I would call it radically incremental,\" says Chris Jennings, a political health strategist who worked for Presidents Bill Clinton and Barack Obama and who has consulted with several of the current Democratic candidates. Republicans who object to other candidates' Medicare for All plans find Biden's alternative just as displeasing. \"No matter how much Biden wants to draw distinctions between his proposals and single-payer, his plan looks suspiciously like \"SandersCare Lite,\" writes former congressional aide and conservative commentator Chris Jacobs in a column for The Federalist. Biden's plan is built on the idea of expanding the ACA to reduce costs for patients and consumers \u2014 similar to what Hillary Clinton campaigned on in 2016. It would do things Democrats have called for repeatedly since the ACA was passed. Among Biden's proposals is a provision that would \"uncap\" federal help to pay for health insurance premiums \u2014 assistance now available only to those with incomes that are 400% of the poverty level, or about $50,000 for an individual. Under Biden's plan, no one would be required to pay more than 8.5 percent of their income toward health insurance premiums. But it includes several proposals that Congress has failed repeatedly to enact, including some that were part of the original debate over the ACA. Plus, Biden's plan has some initiatives that are so expansive, it is hard to imagine them passing Congress \u2014 even if Democrats sweep the presidency and both houses of Congress in 2020. Here are some of the more controversial pieces of the Biden health plan: Public option Although many of the Democratic presidential candidates have expressed varying degrees of support for a Medicare for All plan, nearly all have also endorsed creating a government-sponsored health plan, known colloquially as a \"public option,\" that would be available to people who buy their own health insurance. That eligible group would include anyone who doesn't get insurance through their job or who doesn't qualify for other government programs, like Medicare or Medicaid. A public option was included in the version of the ACA that passed the House in 2009. But its proponents could not muster the 60 votes needed to pass that option in the Senate over GOP objections \u2014 even though the Democrats had 60 votes at the time. Biden's public option, however, would be available to many more people than the 20 million or so who are now in the individual insurance market. According to the document put out by the campaign, this public option also would be available to those who don't like or can't afford their employer insurance, and to small businesses. Most controversial, though, is that the 2.5 million people currently ineligible for either Medicaid or private insurance subsidies because their states have chosen not to expand Medicaid would be automatically enrolled in Biden's public option, at no cost to them or the states where they live. Also included automatically in the public option would be another 2 million people with low incomes who currently are eligible for ACA coverage subsidies \u2013 and who would also be eligible for expanded Medicaid. That part of Biden's proposal has prompted charges that the 14 states that have so far chosen not to expand Medicaid would save money, compared with those that have already expanded the program, because expansion states have to pay 10% of the cost of that new population. Jennings, the Democratic health strategist, argues that extra charge to states that previously expanded Medicaid would be unavoidable under Biden's plan, because people with low incomes in states that haven't expanded Medicaid need coverage most. \"If you're not going to have everyone get a plan right away, you need to make sure those who are most vulnerable do,\" Jennings says. Abortion The Biden plan calls for eliminating the \"Hyde Amendment,\" an annual rider to the spending bill for the Department of Health and Human Services that forbids the use of federal funds to pay for most abortions. Biden recently ran into some difficulty when his position on the Hyde ammendment was unclear. Beyond that, Biden's plan also directly calls for the federal government to fund some abortions. \"[T]he public option will cover contraception and a woman's constitutional right to choose,\" his plan says. In 2010, the Affordable Care Act very nearly failed to become law after an intraparty fight between Democrats who supported and opposed federal funding for abortions. Abortion opponents wanted firm guarantees in permanent law that no federal funds would ever be used for abortion; abortion-rights supporters called that a deal breaker. Eventually a shaky compromise was reached. And while it is true that there are now far fewer Democrats in Congress who oppose abortion than there were in 2010, the idea of even a Democratic-controlled Congress voting for federal abortion funding seems far-fetched. The current Democratic-led House has declined even to include a repeal of the Hyde Amendment in this year's HHS spending bill, because it could not get through the GOP-controlled Senate or get signed by President Trump. Undocumented immigrants When Obama said in a speech to Congress in September 2009 that people not in the U.S. legally would be ineligible for federal help with their purchase of health insurance under the ACA, it prompted the infamous \"You lie!\" shout from Rep. Joe Wilson, R-S.C.. Today, all the Democratic candidates say they would provide coverage to undocumented residents. There is no mention of them specifically in the plan posted on Biden's website, although a Biden campaign official told Politico this week that people in the U.S. who are undocumented would be able to purchase plans on the health insurance exchanges, but would not qualify for subsidies. Still, in his speech unveiling the plan at an AARP-sponsored candidate forum in Iowa, Biden did not address this issue of immigrants' health care. He said only that his plan would expand funding for community health centers, which serve patients regardless of their ability to pay or their immigration status, and that people in the U.S. without legal authority would be able to obtain coverage in emergencies. That is already law.",

When the state's budget was finalized, only young adults up to age 26 were authorized to be included in the expansion. Gov. Gavin Newsom says that's an important first step.\n                \n                    \n                    Rich Pedroncelli/AP\n                    \n                \nhide caption Demonstrators rallied in Sacramento in May for Medi-Cal expansion to undocumented Californians. When the state's budget was finalized, only young adults up to age 26 were authorized to be included in the expansion. Gov. Gavin Newsom says that's an important first step. For years, Beatriz Basurto's family has had to make hard choices about when to pay for medical care, and who should get treatment. \"To me, it was always the doctor would be the last resort,\" she says. \"But for my parents, the doctor was never a choice. No matter how sick they got, they had to suck it up.\" Basurto, 19, says her parents always put the kids' medical needs before their own. The family moved to California from Mexico more than 15 years ago. During that time, most of her family members have been ineligible for Medi-Cal, the state's version of Medicaid, because they aren't citizens. Their situation started to change in 2016, when California expanded the program to all low-income children 18 and under, regardless of immigration status. That opened the doors for Basurto's little sister to enroll. And starting in January of 2020, Beatriz will be allowed to sign up, too. California's governor signed a law Tuesday that approved $98 million to expand Medi-Cal to income-eligible undocumented adults from age 19 until they turn 26, making it the first state in the United States to cover this group. California estimates 138,000 young adults will become insured under the new policy. While the state has expanded options for children and young adults, most undocumented people in California still have limited access to health care. They can sign up for \"restricted\" Medi-Cal, but it only covers emergencies and pregnancy-related care. Many people on this plan end up putting off treatment or turning to county clinics for help. Supporters who want to further expand Medi-Cal to all residents say that move would boost public health and bring down emergency room costs. California Gov. Gavin Newsom has vowed to make everyone eligible. \"We believe in universal health care,\" he said during a speech this month. \"Universal health care's a right, and we're delivering it \u2014 regardless of immigration status \u2014 to everyone up to the age of 26, and we're gonna get the rest of that done, mark my words.\" But after months of debate at the California State Capitol, proposals to offer Medi-Cal to all undocumented adults, as well as a push to cover undocumented seniors, were deemed too costly. Medicaid is a joint state-federal program, but California would use state dollars to pay for expanded benefits to immigrants living in the U.S. without legal permission. Some lawmakers argued California should be spending health care dollars on its own citizens, rather than people who are not living in the state legally. \"We are going to be a magnet that is going to further attract people to a state of California that's willing to write a blank check to anyone that wants to come here,\" said state Sen. Jeff Stone, a Republican, at a recent legislative hearing. President Donald Trump also criticized California for offering health insurance to undocumented people. \"They don't treat their people as well as they treat illegal immigrants,\" the Republican president told reporters in the White House on Monday. \"It's very unfair to our citizens and we're going to stop it, but we may need an election to stop it.\" But advocates say California isn't done fighting for Medicaid expansion. Almas Sayeed, deputy director of the California Immigrant Policy Center, says providing health care is crucial, given federal anti-immigrant hostility. \"For young immigrants, it's a moment of feeling like we don't belong in this country,\" she says. \"We work really hard in California to make sure communities know that they do.\" Beatriz Basurto is eager to sign up for Medi-Cal this January. She attends community college near Los Angeles, and wants to become an environmental scientist. She hopes getting insurance will allow her to seek out mental health care for ongoing stress, some of which she attributes to hostile political rhetoric about immigrants. \"The world isn't always so welcoming,\" she says. \"It can be really, really overwhelming. It exhausts you mentally. It's almost like I have no time to feel anything, because there's always something else I have to do.\" Brenda Huerta, an undocumented 22-year-old, was enrolled in a health plan through her university. But that coverage expired this summer, after she graduated. She says her college plan was great for checkups, but didn't cover large expenses. When Huerta broke her leg she ended up paying for her care out-of-pocket. And she's still helping pay off hospital bills from when her mom had major surgery. Huerta needs new glasses, and she wants to continue regular medical and dental care. But she isn't sure if she'll sign up for Medi-Cal next year. Even with coverage, she's worried her costs will stack up. \"Paying the [student] loans that I have, I haven't really been thinking about health insurance,\" she says. She and other young adults recently met with Gov. Gavin Newsom to lobby for the expansion of Medicaid eligibility to all Californians. \"Everyone in the room, we did talk about our struggles as undocumented people not having health insurance,\" she says. \"And we also mentioned how our parents suffer from not having health insurance, because it puts an economic burden on us.\" Newsom's office estimated expanding eligibility to all undocumented adults would cost $3.4 billion. About two thirds of California's roughly 2.2 million undocumented immigrants would qualify for Medi-Cal based on income guidelines. Basurto says even though coverage for undocumented young adults is a small step in the larger battle for equal rights, it makes her feel more at home in the U.S. \"I do belong here,\" she says, \"regardless of what others say.\" This story is part of NPR's health reporting collaboration with Capital Public Radio and Kaiser Health News.",

Gavin Newsom (left) talks with members of a Diabetes Talking Circle during his visit to the Sacramento Native American Health Center in Sacramento, Calif., on Tuesday. California has become the first state in the country to offer government-subsidized health benefits to young adults living in the U.S. illegally. The measure signed by Gov. Gavin Newsom on Tuesday extends coverage to low-income, undocumented adults ages 25 and younger for the state's Medicaid program. Since 2016, California has allowed children under 18 to receive taxpayer-backed health care despite immigration status. And state officials expect that the plan will cover roughly 90,000 people. The idea of giving health benefits to undocumented immigrants is supported by most of the Democratic candidates running for president, and California's move comes as the Trump administration continues to ramp up its hard-line crackdown on illegal immigration. On Tuesday, Newsom said the state law draws a sharp contrast with Trump's immigration policies. \"If you believe in universal health care, you believe in universal health care,\" Newsom said. \"We are the most un-Trump state in America when it comes to health policy.\" In California, extending health benefits to undocumented immigrants is widely popular. A March survey conducted by the nonpartisan Public Policy Institute of California found that almost two-thirds of state residents support providing coverage to young adults who are not legally authorized to live in the country. California, the institute notes, has more immigrants than any other state. And an estimated 14% of them are living in the state without legal status. A national poll suggests that many Americans across the country are far less accepting of the notion of giving health coverage to those who came into the U.S. illegally. A CNN poll conducted after the Democratic debates last month found that 59% of those surveyed do not think government-backed health coverage should be provided to undocumented immigrants. In most states, people living in the country illegally are not eligible for federal health insurance programs like Medicaid and Medicare, except in some cases, like medical emergencies and pregnancies, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures. Republican lawmakers in California criticized the law, arguing that the state should be spending health care dollars on those living in the state legally. \"We are going to be a magnet that is going to further attract people to a state of California that's willing to write a blank check to anyone that wants to come here,\" said Republican state Sen. Jeff Stone at a May legislative hearing. \"We are doing a disservice to citizens who legally call California their home.\" The plan does not cover all unauthorized immigrants under 25, only those whose incomes are low enough to qualify. State officials estimate in the first year the program will cover about 138,000 residents and cost California taxpayers $98 million. Trump has publicly attacked Newsom's plans. \"It's crazy what they're doing. It's crazy,\" Trump told reporters last week. \"And it's mean, and it's very unfair to our citizens. And we're going to stop it, but we may need an election to stop it.\"",

            "article_content": "Mother Jones journalist Ari Berman says recent Supreme Court decisions on redistricting and the 2020 census citizenship question will help determine which party is in power in the next decade.  TERRY GROSS, HOST: This is FRESH AIR. I'm Terry Gross. The Supreme Court handed down two decisions at the end of their session last month that could have a big impact on the outcome of elections in the States. The court ruled it had no power to intervene when states use partisan gerrymandering to draw maps for electoral districts, saying it was an issue for state legislatures and state courts. And in a related case, the court ruled that the Trump administration could not add a citizenship question to the census. Though the census questionnaires were scheduled to go to the printer on July 1, President Trump has been tweeting that the government is moving forward with the plan to include the question. Yesterday, Attorney General William Barr said he sees a way for the administration to include the question in the census, that action will be taken within the coming days. The outcome of the census plays a large part in determining electoral districts in the States. My guest today is Ari Berman, who's been writing about both of these issues, gerrymandering and the census, for Mother Jones magazine, where he covers voting rights. He's also a senior fellow at Type Media and the author of the book \"Give Us The Ballot: The Modern Struggle For Voting Rights In America.\" Ari Berman, welcome back to FRESH AIR. ARI BERMAN: Thank you for having me back, Terry. GROSS: So how is the citizenship question related to political representation? BERMAN: Well, the census is directly related to political representation, Terry, because the census forms the basis for how we draw political districts. It forms the basis for how many seats a state will get in the House of Representatives. It forms the basis for how many Electoral College votes a state will receive. So the census isn't just one of many surveys; the census really forms the basis for political power in America. And I think the fear about this citizenship question is that some communities, in particular immigrant communities, are going to be less likely to respond to the census if the citizenship question is on there because they're very afraid of the Trump administration's immigration policies, and they don't want to give the Trump administration their citizenship data. And if immigrant communities don't respond to the census in large numbers, that will shift political power away from areas with lots of immigrants into wider and, quite frankly, more Republican areas. GROSS: President Trump said we need to know how many citizens there are in order to determine representation. But representation isn't based on citizens; it's based on the number of people. BERMAN: That's right. And that's a really important point that you made, Terry, and I think it gets at the real reason the Trump administration wants this question about citizenship on the census. Because right now districts are drawn based on total population, so everyone counts when you draw a new political district in the same way that if you have a fire at your house, the fire department isn't going to ask, what's your citizenship status? They're going to put the fire out. And so for decades, districts have been drawn based on total population. What the Trump administration I think wants to do - they haven't come out and flat out said it, but they've hinted at it - what I think the Trump administration wants to do is draw districts based on citizens, not based on the total population. And they need this question about citizenship on the 2020 census to be able to do that. But the point of the census is to count every person in America. The constitutional mandate of the census, dating back to 1790, is for a, quote, \"just and perfect enumeration\" of the population. And if you have certain groups who decline to respond to the census because they're afraid of how their information could be used, that jeopardizes the purpose of the census in the first place, which is to try to count everyone. GROSS: So what did the Supreme Court rule about the case that the Trump administration was making about the importance of adding the citizenship question? BERMAN: Well, it was a somewhat convoluted decision, Terry, because when it first came out, I saw tweets saying, Supreme Court upholds citizenship question (laughter), and I saw tweets saying Supreme Court strikes down citizenship question. So I was thinking, well, what actually happened here? And I had to read the opinion two or three times before I really understood it because, for the first 20 pages of the opinion, Chief Justice John Roberts makes the case for why a citizenship question is constitutional. So you're thinking, OK, he upheld this. Then on Page 23, there's a very abrupt shift, and Roberts says, even though you can do this, you need to have a good reason for it. And the Justice Department's rationale for this and the Trump administration's rationale for this, that this question about citizenship was needed to enforce the Voting Rights Act, in Roberts' words, seems to have been contrived. So what he did is Roberts upheld a lower court decision striking down the citizenship question, and he said to the Trump administration, come up with a better reason, or else this is not going to be on the census. GROSS: So last week, President Trump ordered the Justice Department to keep pushing forward with the citizenship question. And so the president said there are several routes open - one is an executive order; one is going back to the court. Monday of this week, the Justice Department replaced the legal team that argued the case initially. Where are we now with the citizenship question? BERMAN: This has been a wild story, Terry (laughter), for a very dry and wonky issue. On Tuesday of last week, the Justice Department and the Commerce Department said that the 2020 census forms would be printed without the citizenship question audit. Voting rights advocates declared victory. It seemed like the question wasn't going to be on the census form. The next day, on Wednesday of last week, President Trump said that he was, quote, \"absolutely moving forward\" with the question and called reports that they were dropping the question fake, in all caps with an exclamation point. So that led to a lot of confusion. And lawyers for the Justice Department were completely blindsided by this. One lawyer who was a political appointee in the Trump administration said that they had, quote, \"been instructed\" to try to find a path forward to adding this question back to the census. So it seemed like, on Tuesday, they had dropped the question, and then on Wednesday, it was suddenly back on, based on President Trump's tweet. And then subsequently, Trump was tweeting all the time about it and then, on Friday, said that he was considering a number of options, including an executive order. Then on Monday of this week, the news broke that the Justice Department was replacing all of its lawyers on the team handling the citizenship question. So this is a really (laughter) insane scenario where it seems like President Trump's Twitter feed is determining how the Justice Department is approaching a $10 to $15 billion operation that's constitutionally mandated every 10 years and is one of the most important things we do as a country. GROSS: What do you think the likely next step would be if the Justice Department continues to pursue this case through the courts? BERMAN: Well, I think they're going to try to appeal directly to the Supreme Court. They are going to try to come up with what they call a new rationale for adding this question because John Roberts said that their rationale that this was needed to enforce the Voting Rights Act was contrived. So they're going to try to come up with a new rationale. I would imagine that would first go to the lower courts. The lower courts would look at it, unless there is an expedited review, and the Supreme Court basically looks at some briefs and either decides this over the summer or schedules an emergency hearing sometime in the fall. The problem is we're running out of time here, that the Trump administration repeatedly said to the Supreme Court that census forms needed to be finalized by the end of June. And in fact, that's why they had decided, as of last week, that the forms would be printed without the citizenship question because, over and over and over, they said the deadline for finalizing census forms was the end of June. And that's why the Supreme Court actually heard this case on expedited appeal. Remember, Terry, this case went directly from the district court to the Supreme Court. It bypassed the court of appeals entirely, which is very, very rare. The reason that happened was because the Trump administration said this was so urgent. So for them to turn around and say, we have a lot more time than we initially told you, would seem to be a mischaracterization to the Supreme Court. And secondly, they've been arguing for a year and a half that this was needed to better enforce the Voting Rights Act. So the idea that, in a span of a week, they could somehow turn around and say, oh, we have an entirely new reason for this question, but we just didn't present it to the court for over a year, I think that's going to leave some of the justices mystified. And honestly, Chief Justice John Roberts cares a lot about the legitimacy of the court. He seems to care about the processes by which things are done. And this entire process, from the minute the Supreme Court ruled on the citizenship question, has been such a disaster from beginning to end, with Justice Department reversals, with President Trump's Twitter feed, with the Justice Department replacing all of its lawyers - I can't imagine that's helping their case with John Roberts. GROSS: So last week, President Trump said he would consider an executive order to add the citizenship question to the census. Wouldn't that be defying the Supreme Court? BERMAN: First off, does the president even have an authority to do the executive order on the census? My understanding is that Congress has the authority over the census, and they've delegated some responsibility to the Commerce Department, but the President can't change the census via executive order. So I think that alone is unconstitutional. Secondly, I don't think that really solves the Trump administration's problem with the Supreme Court. It wasn't that they didn't have the authority to do this; it was that they didn't have a good reason to do this. So unless the executive order is accompanied by a very good reason, which had not been presented to the court for over a year, it's hard to see how an executive order solves the Trump administration's problems. To me, it seems more like political posturing than an actual solution to try to get this question back on the 2020 census. GROSS: There hasn't been a citizenship question on the census since 1950. Why was it on the census before 1950 and why was it taken off after 1950? BERMAN: It was on before 1950 because it was just one of many pieces of demographic data that the Census Bureau collected. But I think, as the country began to change demographically, as there were more noncitizens, both documented and undocumented, it became more of an invasive question, and they had other means to gather that data. And after the citizenship question was dropped in the 1950s, every time there was some discussion about adding it back, the Census Bureau opposed it, and they said this question is going to provoke a lot of fear. It's going to make the census less accurate because people are going to lie about their citizenship status out of fear. And we have other means of collecting this data that's less intrusive. GROSS: Let me reintroduce you here. If you're just joining us, my guest is Ari Berman. He's a senior reporter at Mother Jones magazine, covering voting rights. He's the author of \"Give Us The Ballot: The Modern Struggle For Voting Rights In America.\" And he's a fellow at Type Media. We're going to talk more about voting issues, including the Supreme Court decision that was handed down last month about gerrymandering. We'll be right back. This is FRESH AIR. (SOUNDBITE OF SLOWBERN'S \"WHEN WAR WAS KING\") GROSS: This is FRESH AIR. And if you're just joining us, we're talking about voting issues and the two big Supreme Court decisions. My guest is Ari Berman. He's the author of the book \"Give Us The Ballot: The Modern Struggle For Voting Rights In America.\" And he covers voting rights for Mother Jones, where he's a senior reporter. So, you know, there's a person who is a big connection between the gerrymandering issue, which the Supreme Court just handed a ruling on, and the citizenship question, which the Supreme Court just handed down a ruling on, and that person is Thomas Hofeller. You describe him as the GOP's longtime redistricting mastermind. So after his death, his estranged daughter Stephanie found his hard drives, which she thought might have important information on it. So she turned it over to the North Carolina branch of Common Cause, which was challenging partisan gerrymandering. What are some of the things that we learned from these hard drives about his motivations for partisan gerrymandering and adding the citizenship question to the census? BERMAN: This was a crazy turn of events. So there was a lawsuit in North Carolina challenging the state legislative maps in North Carolina in state court. And they got all of these files from Thomas Hofeller, who, for decades, until he passed away last year, has been the lead expert on redistricting for the Republican Party. He was the redistricting counsel for the Republican National Committee. He drew maps for Republicans in virtually every important swing state dating back decades. And what these files showed was that Hofeller had authored a study in 2015 that analyzed the impact of adding a citizenship question on the 2020 census. And what the study showed was that Hofeller said that this would be clearly disadvantageous to Democrats and an advantage to Republicans and non-Hispanic whites. And if you wanted to draw districts based on citizenship rather than total population, you needed a citizenship question on the census to do this, which Hofeller said would be a radical departure from the one person, one vote standard the Supreme Court issued in the 1960s. So this was giant, smoking gun evidence. Here you had the Republican Party's lead redistricting expert, the guy who drew gerrymandered maps in states all across the country, saying that the purpose of the citizenship question was to try to draw districts to help Republicans and whites. Now, a lot of us believe that was the purpose of the question all along, but to have someone of Hofeller's stature say this was really eye-opening. GROSS: I'm not sure you'd know the answer to this, but I've been trying to understand why this issue is so important to President Trump. Now, I know immigration and people who are here without documentation is one of his key issues, so there's that, but he must also know that it figures into voting issues. So do you think that Trump is behaving kind of unilaterally? Do you think that there are people within the party - do you think there are people who are pressuring him to keep moving forward on this? BERMAN: Absolutely. We know, for example, that people like Kris Kobach, the former secretary of state of Kansas who has been one of the leading architects in the Republican Party of cracking down on immigration and also of restricting voting rights, began discussing the citizenship question all the way back in 2016 with the Trump campaign. And then Kobach said he brought this up with President Trump after the inauguration. He discussed it with President Trump. He discussed it with Steve Bannon. He discussed it with then-White House chief of staff Reince Priebus. And it was Bannon who called Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross, who oversees the Census Bureau, and said, you need to talk to Kobach about the citizenship question. And Kobach said in July of 2017 that it was essential that Wilbur Ross add this question to the census because Kobach - in Kobach's words, Kobach wanted to draw districts in such a way that only citizens were counted. So, clearly, you had a political motivation there - that - one of the reasons, I think, major figures in the conservative movement are pushing for this question is so that they can try to draw districts in a way that's advantageous to the Republican Party and advantageous to the preservation of white political power. You also have some figures in the Trump administration that want the citizenship question so they can use it for immigration enforcement purposes. Now, it's not clear how they're going to actually do this because the question - the Census Bureau is not going to ask people whether they are undocumented or documented. They're just going to ask people, are you a citizen or not? So they're not going to get information on how many undocumented people there are to initiate deportation raids, for example. They're not going to get that information from the citizenship question. Not only that, but census information is confidential. And this is really, really important because during World War II, the Census Bureau shared information on Japanese Americans with the Secret Service, which was then used to intern Japanese Americans during World War II - a very, very dark period in our country's history and a very, very dark period for the Census Bureau. And they have adopted very strict confidentiality standards. They're not allowed to share data with the Department of Homeland Security or other agencies. So I don't know what they're planning to do with immigration enforcement, but I don't even think they're going to be able to achieve their agenda based on this question. But absolutely, politically, if they're able to get this citizenship question on the 2020 census, it would make it a lot easier for them to be able to escalate the gerrymandering they're already doing in the post-2020 redistricting cycle by drawing districts based on citizenship rather than total population. GROSS: So just to be clear, if citizenship is used to determine political representation, that means that people who are living here legally, people who have green cards, people who are working and paying taxes, would have no representation, and the places where they live wouldn't get federal funds that count them as living there because certain federal funds are apportioned to states according to how many people are there. They wouldn't be counted. BERMAN: That's correct. It could have a very significant impact because I think what people are thinking of is that only undocumented people will be excluded from counting. And by the way, already districts are drawn in such a way that counts everyone. So you can have that argument about whether or not they should be counted. But as of now, everyone is counted. But it wouldn't just be people that are undocumented. It would be people that are here legally that are noncitizens. And then a lot of people who are citizens would be hurt by this just by virtue of the fact that they live in the same kind of areas. And so you would have places like Los Angeles and New York City and Chicago and Houston and Dallas, all of these big metro areas - all of which tend to lean heavily Democratic - they are going to get less money. They're going to have less political power. They're going to have less representation. So it's going to be a shift from blue areas to red areas. And then even within states like Texas that are more conservative, it's going to shift power from Democratic areas to redder areas. And so I think this is really the Republican Party's long-term plan for trying to preserve white political power. They believe by adding this citizenship question on the census that they can both depress response rates from immigrant communities so that those places have less power. But on a broader sense, they want to be able to draw districts for the next decade and beyond that enshrine white political power. And the citizenship question on the census is their best vehicle for doing so. And I think that's the reason you're seeing President Trump push so hard for this question even after the Supreme Court largely shut the door. GROSS: My guest is Ari Berman. He covers voting rights for Mother Jones magazine. After a break, we'll talk about the Supreme Court's decision on gerrymandering and how it may affect the outcome of state elections and the future makeup of the House of Representatives. And Maureen Corrigan will review a new novel she describes as a story about racism, class and the limits of individual possibility. I'm Terry Gross, and this is FRESH AIR. (SOUNDBITE OF JOEL FORRESTER AND PEOPLE LIKE US' \"THE COP-OUT\") GROSS: This is FRESH AIR. I'm Terry Gross. Let's get back to my interview with Ari Berman, who covers voting rights for Mother Jones magazine and is the author of the book \"Give Us The Ballot: The Modern Struggle For Voting Rights In America.\" Last week, the Supreme Court handed down two decisions that will have an impact on voting and the outcome of elections. The court ruled that the Trump administration could not add a citizenship question to the census, at least not based on the rationale the administration presented. But the administration is still pursuing adding the question. The other decision was about gerrymandering. Let's get to gerrymandering and last month's Supreme Court decision. I'm going to ask you to explain the decision and explain why you describe that decision as a doomsday scenario for voting rights. BERMAN: What the Supreme Court said in a 5-4 decision on two gerrymandering cases was that partisan gerrymandering could not be reviewed by the federal courts. And this was a huge setback for voting rights, as I said a doomsday scenario for voting rights because the problem of partisan gerrymandering is getting worse and worse. The maps drawn after the 2010 election during the last redistricting cycle were so much more extreme than the maps drawn during the previous decade. You had a situation, for example, in places like Wisconsin, where Republicans for the state assembly got 46% of votes in 2018 but 64% of legislative seats. That is so unbelievably undemocratic. It goes against everything we believe in a democracy, which is that the person who gets the most votes should be the person who's holding office. But over and over again, we're seeing that Republicans, in particular, because they control the drawing of so many more seats after the 2010 redistricting cycle, they are getting a minority of votes but a majority of seats in key swing states. And so the problem of gerrymandering is getting worse. Lower federal courts are recognizing this. You had decisions by lower courts, lower federal courts in states like Wisconsin, Michigan, Ohio and North Carolina that struck down gerrymandered maps. So gerrymandering is getting worse. The federal courts are recognizing this problem, but the Supreme Court said, not only can we not solve this problem, we can't even review it. And that is just going to incentivize the worst self-interested political behavior in both parties going into the next redistricting cycle, which begins in 2021. GROSS: What was the Supreme Court's rationale for saying, we can't intervene in a state's decision on partisan gerrymandering? BERMAN: The decision was written by Chief Justice John Roberts. And what Roberts said was that redistricting is an inherently political process. And he went back to the Founding Fathers. And he basically said they recognized the dangers of gerrymandering. He gave the example where Patrick Henry tried to gerrymander James Madison in Virginia in the late 1700s. And he basically said, they recognized the problem of gerrymandering, but they left it to state legislatures to deal with. So this was an issue for the states not for the courts. And there was this fascinating back and forth between John Roberts and Elena Kagan, who wrote a very, very strong dissent in the case. And they were arguing not just about the present day but about history. And Roberts was saying the Founding Fathers were basically OK with gerrymandering or they believed the states should solve it. And Kagan was saying that the chief concern of the Founding Fathers was that the people should be able to rule and that nothing undermines the ability of people to rule more than gerrymandering, where election outcomes are predetermined by who controls the drawing of the maps. And Kagan said in its most extreme form, gerrymandering amounts to election rigging. And she said, don't just look at history. Look at the present day; that the gerrymandering of now is so much more extreme than it had been in the past. And we are basically saying we know this problem is going to get worse, but we can't do anything about it. And that is a total abdication of the responsibility not just of the federal courts but of the highest court in the land. GROSS: So, basically, whichever party is in power in the state House gets to draw the districting boundaries every 10 years. And the cycle starts again in 2021, which is very soon. So... BERMAN: Exactly. GROSS: There's a lot at stake here. And it will be determined - what - it will determine the next 10 years politically. BERMAN: Exactly. And that's one reason why the Supreme Court case was so significant not just for what they ruled - that partisan gerrymandering can't be reviewed by the federal courts - but also the timing; the fact that we know the next redistricting cycle is going to happen in 2021. And what happened after the 2010 election was that was a wave election by Republicans. That was the Tea Party wave election. And they were able to take over virtually every important swing state in the country. And they were able to draw state legislative and U.S. House districts in four times as many places as Democrats, so Republicans had a huge advantage in the last redistricting cycle. And if you look at the numbers, Republicans still control every state legislative chamber in key swing states like Wisconsin and Michigan and North Carolina and Ohio and Pennsylvania. And that's not because they're so popular in those states. It's because they controlled the drawing of the maps in 2011 and were able to lock in Republican political power for the next decade. And that could become even easier to do now in 2021, knowing that there is going to be no federal review of this process. If they just do a partisan gerrymander, if they don't do a racial gerrymander or other things like that, which are still unconstitutional, but if they just draw districts to try to benefit one party or the other, the Supreme Court has said, we're not going to stop that. GROSS: Republicans actually had a strategy for taking over majority control of the states, in part, to be able to control redistricting. BERMAN: They did. And they were very open about this. In March of 2010, Karl Rove published a op-ed in The Wall Street Journal. And he says, he who controls redistricting will control Congress, so he said it. And they formed a group. It was called REDMAP, which is the Republican redistricting strategy. And they raised a lot of money. This was after the Citizens United decision, in which the Supreme Court said you could raise unlimited money from corporate entities and from large donors. And so they raised a lot of money from big donors from corporate interests. They put that money - which was $30 million, which was a lot of money to spend on state races. They put that money in obscure state legislative races that nobody was focusing on in 2010. They were able to flip virtually every important key swing state - places like Wisconsin and North Carolina and Ohio and Michigan. And then after they got these legislative majorities, they were - they then connected their redistricting experts with the state legislatures that were just elected. So they had a plan all the way through. They had a plan to raise the money needed to take back state legislatures. They had a plan to elect new state legislatures. And then they had a plan for these state legislatures to gerrymander as effectively as possible to retain power for the next decade. And the plan worked absolutely beautifully from beginning to end, and Democrats had no comparable strategy at any point in this process. GROSS: So now there's a group of Democrats trying to regain majorities in states so that they have some control over districting in 2021. And Obama's first attorney general, Eric Holder, has made ending partisan gerrymandering his issue. And you say, while everybody's focusing on 2020 and the presidential election, Eric Holder and his group are focusing on 2021 and on redistricting. So what is his goal? BERMAN: His goal, which I write about in the new issue of Mother Jones, is to try to unrig what he views as a rigged political system where Republicans have unified control - so both the governor's office and both branches of the state legislature and key states like Wisconsin. And he is fighting a multipronged battle. His group, the National Democratic Redistricting Committee, they are filing lawsuits against gerrymandering. They are trying to advocate for things like independent redistricting commissions to make the process more fair and less political, less partisan to one party or another. I think the main thing that Eric Holder is trying to do is to get more attention on state legislative races because during the Obama era, Democrats lost nearly 1,000 state legislative seats. It's absolutely remarkable just how much state power cratered for Democrats. And they're trying to rebuild this. Democrats did a fairly good job in 2018. They picked up nearly 300 state legislative seats. They were able to elect Democratic governors in some places like Wisconsin to break up one-party rule. But there's still a long way for them to go, and Holder is very concerned that with 20-something people running for president on the Democratic side that state legislative elections are being overlooked and that people are spending so much time focusing on the presidential election, they're forgetting that these state legislative elections in 2020 are going to determine power at both the congressional level and the state legislative level for the next decade. And so Holder is frantically trying to catch up. GROSS: Is Holder's goal to get Democrats to draw the district maps instead of Republicans, or is his goal to make that process truly nonpartisan? BERMAN: He says his goal is to try to make the process more nonpartisan and more apolitical than it currently is. He told me, I don't want to replace a Republican gerrymander with a Democratic gerrymander. And so he's supported things like independent redistricting commissions. Their main goal has been trying to break up one-party rule in places like Wisconsin so that the map will be a product of compromise. That is really where he's focused the majority of his attention. But there is a tension within the Democratic Party about this. And that tension is only going to be exacerbated by the Supreme Court's decision. You're going to have officials in the Democratic Party say, why should I unilaterally disarm if the Supreme Court gave a green light to partisan gerrymandering and the Republicans are going to do it everywhere, but in Democratic states, we're just going to pass fair maps that have more balanced representation? Well, that's going to put us at a severe disadvantage. GROSS: Let's take a short break here, and then we'll talk some more. If you're just joining us, my guest is Ari Berman. He reports on voting rights for Mother Jones magazine, where he's a senior reporter, and he's the author of the book \"Give Us The Ballot: The Modern Struggle For Voting Rights In America.\" We'll be right back. This is FRESH AIR. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) GROSS: This is FRESH AIR. And if you're just joining us, my guest is Ari Berman. He's the author of the book \"Give Us The Ballot: The Modern Struggle For Voting Rights In America,\" and he reports on voting rights for Mother Jones magazine. Last year, voters in five states approved ballot initiatives to turn over redistricting to independent commissions. So how do some of those commissions look as an alternative to partisan gerrymandering? BERMAN: It depends on the state, and it depends on the process. But I think, generally speaking, these commissions produce maps that on the whole are thought to be fair and more representative of the state as a whole. And it works in different ways. In a place like Iowa, for example, they have a nonpartisan demographer who is very well-respected. And that person just draws the districts with minimal interference from the legislative process. In other places, like in Michigan in 2021, they're going to have a citizens' commission. So they're going to have people with different ideologies, but they're going to be people that are not part of the legislature and not part of the political process. Now, the thing you always worry about with these commissions is, are the politicians in power going to try to undermine them? 'Cause already we saw in one state, in Missouri, that passed an independent redistricting commission where a nonpartisan group is going to draw the districts there. We already saw legislation proposed in the legislature in the last term to try to weaken that commission. Now, it didn't pass, but it could easily pass again in 2020. So ballot initiatives are not a cure-all, and independent commissions are not a cure-all. And one of the things I think people were disturbed about in John Roberts' decision and the gerrymandering case is he pointed to independent redistricting commissions as one solution to this problem. But Roberts didn't note that in 2015, he voted to gut an independent redistricting commission from the state of Arizona. So I think some cynical people believe the Supreme Court's saying, OK, you can use independent redistricting but then those commissions are going to come before the Supreme Court, and the Supreme Court's then going to strike those very commissions down. Now, that would be incredibly hypocritical for the court to do that, but nonetheless, four justices are already on record as supporting that position. It was only Anthony Kennedy, who's no longer on the court, that saved the viability of independent redistricting commissions in places like Arizona. GROSS: There's another big voting issue that you've been following, and this pertains to Florida. Last year, Florida voters approved a ballot initiative overturning the state's law saying that convicted felons could never vote again. And so overturning that would have restored the vote to 1.4 million Floridians, but the Republicans countered that. What did they do? BERMAN: What Republicans in the Florida legislature did is they passed a law this year, which was just signed by the governor, was to require all of those people with past felony convictions that were set to get their voting rights restored, that they would have to pay all fines, fees and restitution before becoming eligible to vote. Now, this is such a big deal because so many people with past felony convictions in Florida owe tens of thousands of dollars in fines, fees or restitution after their sentence. And I think the voters in Florida, broadly speaking, when they passed this initiative restoring voting rights to ex-felons in 2018, I think they believed that if you had paid your debt to society, you would be able to vote and that paying your debt meant serving your time. That was - when I reported in Florida, that's how I understood how the public viewed this issue. But it's very, very easy to find people who owe tens of thousands of dollars in fines and fees and restitution and many of them are poor, and they'll never be able to pay this off. And so what the ACLU and other groups who are challenging this new law are saying is that this is a poll tax, that this essentially conditions voting on how much money you have and whether you can pay your fines and fees off. And there was a study that was done about a decade ago that said that up to 40% of those people who are waiting to have their rights restored owed past fines and fees. If you look at the 1.4 million people that were set to have their rights restored, if 40% of them can't pay off their fines, that means over half a million people who are set to have their right to vote back might not actually get the right to vote back. That's an enormous number of people who could potentially be disenfranchised by this new law. GROSS: And it's also an enormous number of people who could tip the balance for the state in the next presidential election. BERMAN: Absolutely. You just look at the 2018 election in Florida. The Senate race in Florida was decided by 10,000 votes. The governor's race in Florida was decided by 30,000 votes. In that same election, 1.7 million people couldn't vote because of a past felony conviction. And 1.4 million of those people were set to have their voting rights restored. So that meant there could be over a million new voters eligible to cast a ballot in one of the most important swing states of the country. And this disproportionately affects African American voters who make up more than 20% of those people that have lost their voting rights. They also made up a huge chunk of people who registered to vote after the ballot initiative went into effect before the Florida legislature passed this new law. So I think the feeling is that this is going to shrink the number of voters. And in particular, it's going to hurt black voters and Democratic-leaning voters - not exclusively. There's going to be a whole lot of white Republican ex-felons who are going to lose their voting rights as well, but because of mass incarceration and because of the way our criminal justice system works, felon disenfranchisement falls more on some people, particularly minority communities, than others. And now you're just putting an entirely new roadblock up for them. And so I think there are going to be some people that won't be able to pay their fines off at all. There are going to be other people that actually probably are eligible to vote, but they're not going to be sure about the process, and they're not going to want to take the risk of possibly voting for fear that they could be prosecuted if they had made some sort of mistake. And so I think this just sends a real chilling message in Florida to a group that's already pretty vulnerable and marginalized, thought they were in line to get their rights back and now they might not or it might be that they have to complete step X, Y and Z instead. GROSS: Ari Berman, thank you so much for talking with us. BERMAN: Thank you so much for having me back, Terry.

The two nights of debates underscored the changes within the party.\n                \n                    \n                    Wilfredo Lee/AP\n                    \n                \nhide caption A stage full of Democratic presidential hopefuls in Miami. The two nights of debates underscored the changes within the party. When history looks back on the first round of debates among Democrats in the 2020 presidential cycle, it will see a generational milestone. Both nights of the twin bill in Miami put the spotlight on a national party in transition, loosening the bonds of its past and looking ahead to new personalities to propel its future. Parties are about people, and also about ideas. The ideas openly discussed this week included free tuition at public colleges, new taxes on wealth and radical action to address climate change. They also included universal health care, medical coverage for undocumented immigrants and the phasing out of private health insurance. All these would have been regarded as outside the mainstream not too long ago, and Republicans will surely argue they are still outside the mainstream today. But we all tend to remember candidate debates for their emblematic moments. And this time around, viewers may remember best the Thursday night confrontation between former Vice President Joe Biden, the best-known political commodity on stage, and Sen. Kamala Harris of California, who's still a newbie at the national level. In the matter of Harris v Biden TV coverage featured Harris' challenge to Biden's posture on busing for integration \u2014 when he was a senator and Harris was a school girl at a bus stop. Harris was among the first black students in her cohort bused to mostly white schools in an attempt to grant equal opportunities for education, a policy that Harris said helped her and which was bitterly controversial for millions of Americans. Surely Biden had expected someone to raise his history of co-existence with Dixie-flavored Democrats in this debate. Yet he seemed thrown off balance by the onrush of Harris' personal emotion. The prospective nominee of 2020 was clumsily enmeshed in an issue from the 1970s. In fact, through much of the evening, Biden's famous ebullience seemed to have deserted him, leaving a pale shadow of the personality he showed in previous presidential runs. Many faces of a party moving left That was the takeaway video from the second night. But both nights emphasized the Democratic Party's commitment to change \u2014 progressive and even radical change \u2013 as well as its deep investment in the enfranchisement of women, the young and people of color. The new faces on stage personified the change. Three were in their 30s, four in their 40s, with six women, five people of color and an Indiana mayor whose first answer included a mention of his husband. The contrast could scarcely be starker with the party of President Trump, who has said his e-election campaign theme will be \"Keep America Great.\" And it is not just the president who sounds the theme and hearkens back to the America of earlier generations. The crowds at his rallies and the ranks of Republicans in Congress also continue to be dominated by older white males. Given the inevitable and natural force of that contrast, the urgency of the new pulsed through all four hours of these candidate showcases, which brought together 10 candidates on each night and subjected them to promptings from a tag team of five NBC News personalities. But while some of the journalists' questions were pointed, the most memorable moments came largely at the initiative of the candidates. So it was when Harris sailed into Biden on the second night. But if Biden is not the juggernaut some thought he'd be, who benefits? The older candidates Democratic presidential candidates former vice president Joe Biden and Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., speak at the same time during the Democratic primary debate hosted by NBC News.\n                \n                    \n                    Wilfredo Lee/AP\n                    \n                \nhide caption Democratic presidential candidates former vice president Joe Biden and Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., speak at the same time during the Democratic primary debate hosted by NBC News. Standing between Biden and Harris on stage was the man who has run a strong second in the polls \u2013 Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont. At 77, Sanders is a year old than Biden and four years older than when he was when he took on Hillary Clinton in 2016. Sanders benefited in that bid from his differences with Clinton and from the lack of any other competition after the first few debates in 2015. Sanders attracted many young people at the time who were disillusioned with Clinton or eager for something different. The difference Sanders brought this week was not only reminiscent of his anti-capitalist rhetoric from four years ago \u2013 it was a near perfect reprise of it in style and substance. Nothing requires any candidate to evolve on a second go-round, but Sanders was notable for his lack of interest in doing so. Running third in many polls has been Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, who at 70 is also third oldest among the candidates. But Warren exudes physical and intellectual energy, often seeming to literally vibrate with ideas on a wide range of subjects. Her age notwithstanding, Warren has her gender and personal resume to identify her with change. So she came through the week among those seen as gaining ground. The younger candidates But this time around, younger voters can find plenty of candidates who offer freshness far closer to their own age. First and foremost among them is South Bend Mayor Pete Buttigieg, who at 37 is barely over the Constitutional requirement for the presidency. Buttigieg is the openly gay Indiana Democrat who came to Miami battered by racial confrontations and storm damage back home. But in his direct and low-key way, he tried to use these travails to illustrate his candid approach to problems. His brief remarks on the subject had overtones of then-candidate Barack Obama's race speech in March 2008 in the midst of the controversy over his outspoken pastor, Jeremiah Wright. Although not especially prominent in the Thursday night debate, Buttigieg made his mark \u2013 as he has been doing throughout the year. In this he clearly stands above the other 30-somethings in the pack, Rep. Tulsi Gabbard of Hawaii and Rep. Eric Swalwell of California, both members of Congress seen as building name recognition for later career moves. Another member who got on stage this week was Rep. Tim Ryan of Ohio, who is 45.

Amy Klobuchar, D-Minn., answers a question during a Democratic primary debate hosted by NBC News. Some of the candidates in their 50s on stage this week could also be seen as newcomers in a more typical presidential field. They include four U.S. senators: \u2013 Cory Booker of New Jersey, Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota, Kirsten Gillibrand of New York and Michael Bennet of Colorado. The first three of these had been seen as potential threats to the frontrunners. Each made an effort to be noticed this week, with Booker logging more minutes than any other contestant on Wednesday night and Klobuchar scoring points on women's issues. Gillibrand stood out on Thursday night by interrupting repeatedly in an effort to break through \u2013 a tactic also used by New York Mayor Bill de Blasio on the previous night, to mixed reviews. In the end, Booker may have gained the most traction of this group, although the emergence of Harris on Thursday night might dilute some of his appeal to minority voters. The Texans Also worth noting as generational players are the two Texans, both in their mid-40s, whose trajectories seemed to cross while headed in opposite directions this week. On the rise is Julian Castro, 44, former mayor of San Antonio and secretary of Housing and Urban Development. Castro had been seen as a prospect for vice president, but he attracted more notice Wednesday night than in all the campaign to date. Going the other direction is Beto O'Rourke, 46, a former member of Congress best known for a strong but unsuccessful Senate run against Sen. Ted Cruz in Texas. O'Rourke has thus far been missing the magic appeal he had in his home state last year, and his rather lackluster appearance this week did little to alter that. The governors Two once or current Western governors in their late 60s also joined the crowd. Gov. Jay Inslee of Washington stressed climate change on Wednesday night and former Gov. John Hickenlooper of Colorado defended business and bipartisanship on Thursday. One curiosity of the 2020 field is the inclusion of rather obscure candidates who might not have made the stage in another era but who bring something off-beat to the discussion. John Delaney is a former congressman from Maryland who touts his business credentials and stands to the right of the pack on most issues. Delaney has been campaigning steadily since 2017 but has yet to make much headway in the polls, although he did qualify for this round of debates and may continue to do so. Also in the caboose category are other \"brand builders\" such as author Marianne Williamson, a self-help guru who talks about love as a force in politics, and Andrew Yang, an entrepreneur who favors creating a base annual income of $12,000 for all adults.",

Spain is heading for general elections on Sunday \u2014 its third in just four years. But this vote could be different. A far-right party is predicted to pick up some parliamentary seats for the first time since the country transitioned to democracy about 40 years ago. Supporters like the Vox party's tough stances against immigration and feminism, and against the push for independence in the Catalonia region in northeastern Spain. Critics say it has revived Spanish nationalist ideas that had become fringe after the fall of Spain's long dictatorship. \"They're increasing hate, racism, and a lot of things that were hidden,\" says Mar\u00eda Bay\u00f3, 40, who is talking about politics with friends outside a bar in the outskirts of Barcelona, in Catalonia. Bay\u00f3 wants candidates to win who favor Catalonia's independence from Spain, a divisive issue. But she blames right-wing parties for railing against secessionists and immigration, while distracting from important problems like the lack of jobs and affordable housing. Spain's high unemployment rate, which hovers above 14%, is the top concern for most Spaniards, according to the Center for Sociological Research. Originally slated for next year, Prime Minister Pedro S\u00e1nchez called early elections after his center-left Socialist government failed to get its budget passed in February. As with both 2015 and 2016 parliamentary elections, no single party is expected to win an overall majority on Sunday. That could mean drawn-out jockeying among parties to form a coalition government.

The latest polls suggest the incumbent Socialist Party could get the most votes but would need outside support \u2014 possibly from the leftist anti-austerity United We Can Party and Basque or Catalan parties \u2014 to stay in power. Or conservative parties could instead win enough votes to form a governing coalition that could include Vox. Political researcher Berta Barbet, at the Autonomous University of Barcelona, says either a left-wing or right-wing coalition government is possible. \"Our heritage, our freedom\" Vox promises to take power away from regional independence movements, push back against feminism, deport undocumented immigrants and build a wall to keep them out.

In 2004, with pressure from feminist organizations, Spain passed a law intended to reduce domestic violence by making it easier for survivors to report their abusers. Vox wants to scrap the law. In April 2018, Spain's feminist movement erupted with its own #MeToo moment: Five men who allegedly gang-raped an 18-year-old woman were charged with the lesser offense of sexual abuse, after a regional court ruled that no violence was involved. Hundreds of thousands of people took to the streets to demand a more robust rape law.

A Vox supporter in the southern Spanish city of Seville, 48-year-old Juan L\u00f3pez, told NPR earlier this year that he felt like \"nowadays, you have to apologize for being a man.\" Shifting right Other politicians have also taken tougher, right-wing stances in the runup to the vote. The mainstream conservative People's Party leader Pablo Casado told reporters this month he wants to indefinitely suspend Catalonia's autonomy and impose direct rule from Madrid. Former Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy, also of the People's Party, suspended Catalonia's autonomy only temporarily, after its government held an independence vote deemed illegal by Madrid. Nine Catalan leaders were arrested without bail and are now facing trial, while seven others took self-exile abroad. Rajoy called for snap elections in the region, which resulted in another pro-secessionist Catalan government that now seeks to negotiate with Spanish leaders a legal referendum to break away from Spain. Vox has portrayed both the conservative and Socialist governments' handling of the continuing crisis as too \"weak.\" In the streets of Badalona, a town on the outskirts of Barcelona, campaign ads for the governing Socialist Party can be seen with Prime Minister Pedro S\u00e1nchez's face.

President Trump delivered the first Oval Office address of his presidency Tuesday night \u2014 and it came in the midst of a protracted partial government shutdown. There were a lot of questions going into the address, but there were at least as many afterward \u2014 especially, and most importantly: What now? So what did we learn from the president's address and the rare Democratic response? Here are seven insights: 1. We are no closer to the shutdown being over Trump tried to insist that he had already compromised with Democrats, saying he had moved from a concrete wall to barrier made of steel slats. But Democrats see that as no compromise. Remarkably, he neither offered anything else (like, say, bringing some clarity to the situation of the so-called DREAMers, undocumented immigrants brought to the U.S. as children) nor leveled any threat, like that he could declare a national emergency. Not offering a compromise or leveling a threat is particularly curious given the point of Oval Office addresses during a tragedy or a \"crisis\" is to affect some sort of outcome. Congressional leaders are again set to return to the White House on Wednesday for resumed negotiations, but don't expect much to come of that. The president on Thursday is headed to the Southern border, where he's expected to continue making the case for a physical barrier. 2. Trump's dark worldview holds The president's convention acceptance speech (\"the crime and violence that today afflicts our nation\") and his inauguration speech (\"American carnage\") were dark visions of the country. And, once again, when speaking to the whole country in a big moment, the president laid out a dark vision. \"How much more American blood must we shed before Congress does its job?\" Trump said, pushing for increased border security funding. Trump's view of immigration and immigrants as causing exceptional crime and violence is echoed in conservative media, but is not borne out by facts or data. 3. The president's real audience: wavering congressional Republicans While Trump was trying to say he speaks for everyone, his real audience may have been congressional Republicans who are starting to feel the political pressure as the partial shutdown drags on. Three Senate Republicans have said they want the government back open, and Vice President Pence was on Capitol Hill on Tuesday meeting with House Republicans. 4. Instead of being empathetic to federal workers, he insisted this is what they want If the partial shutdown continues through the end of the week, hundreds of thousands of federal workers are going to miss their first paycheck since the stalemate began in late December. So, the pain is going to be felt more strongly soon. But Trump did not speak directly to those workers or show any degree of empathy for them. Instead, he argued, \"This barrier is absolutely critical to border security. It's also what our professionals at the border want and need.\" 5. Trump did OK with the \"optics,\" but that's not the most important thing Style is always the thing a lot of people talk about first when looking at a presidential address. And there are few people who don't like the president who will believe he did a good job in any way. But there were a lot of questions about how this president would do in an Oval Office address, a venue a lot of past presidents have struggled in. Trump was able to make and read his argument without much of a hitch, though it was a very dark speech. (In a tweet late Tuesday, the president seemed to almost congratulate himself, saying to his millions of followers: \"Thank you for soooo many nice comments regarding my Oval Office speech. A very interesting experience!\") But appearances matter far less than the substance, and Tuesday night's address seemed to move the substantive debate \u2014 over a Southern border wall and border security more broadly \u2014 forward very little. 6. Democrats are focused on ending the shutdown, while Trump is focused on the wall Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi deliver a response to President Trump's televised address to the nation Tuesday.\n                \n                    \n                    Nicholas Kamm/AFP/Getty Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi deliver a response to President Trump's televised address to the nation Tuesday. It's rare that the opposition party would deliver a response to an Oval Office address. That's usually left to State of the Union addresses. But Tuesday night, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., were allotted time after the president spoke. They noted that they are in favor of border security, but they made it clear that they're focused on ending the partial shutdown. \"The fact is,\" Pelosi said, \"President Trump has chosen to hold hostage critical services for the health, safety and well-being of the American people and withhold the paychecks of 800,000 innocent workers across the nation \u2013 many of them veterans.\" Schumer ended the address imploring Trump to \"end this shutdown now.\" 7. Is a national emergency declaration the only way out? It's unclear what happens next, with Trump and Democrats living in different universes when it comes to immigration and border security. The president opted not to threaten or declare a national emergency Tuesday night, but could it \u2014 with all of its risks \u2013 be the only play the president has left? That would entail him signing legislation to fund the Cabinet departments and agencies that are closed and it would give him the chance to tell his base that at least he fought as hard as he could to get Congress to act. Of course, such a declaration would end up being challenged in the courts and may be why the president chose not to go there Tuesday. NPR's Mara Liasson contributed to this report.",

Updated 3:55 pm E.T. Friday The government shutdown began with the president's demand for border security money. But it has also halted E-Verify, a federal program that's supposed to prevent immigrants from working here illegally. If U.S. employers want to check whether their prospective hires are eligible to work, they can't. The E-Verify database is \"currently unavailable due to a lapse in government appropriations,\" according to a note on the government-run website. #EVerify  is not available due to lapse in DHS appropriations. https://t.co/xzw4doYGww \"There's an irony there,\" says Julie Pace, an attorney specializing in employment and immigration law at Cavanagh Law Firm in Phoenix. \"We have an electronic wall for E-Verify that should be being used, that the government has not funded.\" There's an irony there. Julie Pace The E-Verify outage is just one way the government shutdown is taking a toll on the U.S. immigration system. President Trump has demanded $5 billion for a border wall, leading to a budget impasse and a partial government shutdown that has affected some Department of Homeland Security operations. Border Patrol agents at the Southwest border are working, but they won't get paid until the shutdown ends. So are tens of thousands of other immigration agents in DHS. A Border Patrol agent arrests a group of Central American migrants after crossing the U.S.-Mexico border fence from Tijuana to San Diego County late last year.\n                \n                    \n                    Guillermo Arias/AFP/Getty Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption A Border Patrol agent arrests a group of Central American migrants after crossing the U.S.-Mexico border fence from Tijuana to San Diego County late last year. \"They are angry, they are scared,\" said Tony Reardon, the head of the National Treasury Employees Union, which represents about 30,000 Customs and Border Protection officers. \"They are doing the work of this country, not knowing whether they are going to be able to put food on the table,\" Reardon said. \"The morale is as low as I have ever seen it.\" Much of the nation's immigration court system is closed, adding to a backlog of more than 800,000 cases and counting. \"We've never been in a situation that is so dire with regard to the backlog of immigration cases nationwide,\" immigration Judge Dana Leigh Marks told NPR's All Things Considered. Marks is former president of the National Association of Immigration Judges and one of many judges who have been furloughed during the shutdown. \"When we have to shut down, those cases are delayed, sometimes for years, before we have space on our dockets to be able to reschedule them,\" said Marks. Some immigration judge are working without pay, but they're only hearing cases where the immigrant is in detention. \"People are totally confused about what to do about showing up or not showing up,\" said Heena Arora, an immigration lawyer in Queens, New York. Arora says some of her clients waited for years for hearings in the backlogged immigration courts. But when their day came, the hearings weren't held because of the shutdown. \"We don't know when it's going to be rescheduled for. It could be rescheduled for next month. It could be rescheduled for next year or even a couple of years later. So we have no idea,\" Arora said. \"It sucks. It sucks for them, and it sucks for me. Because I have no work this week.\" Employers across the country are also grappling with uncertainty about the E-Verify system. \"At first, people thought it was a day or two or three. Now we're into two weeks,\" said Julie Pace, the lawyer in Phoenix. Employers can get in big trouble for knowingly hiring undocumented workers. And Arizona is one of several states where they are required to use E-Verify. The longer the shutdown lasts, Pace says, the more she is fielding panicked calls and emails from employers. \"Now the calls are, we've gotta on board these people. So we're just gonna move forward,\" Pace said. \"Can we do that?\" Some employers will probably go ahead and hire people anyway, Pace says. Others will wait until the shutdown is over. And some may even speed up hiring to get people through the process while E-Verify is down.Officials at U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, the agency that operates E-Verify, say that the \"three-day rule\" for creating new E-Verify cases is suspended while the system is down. \"USCIS has taken a number of steps to minimize the burden on both employees and employers, who can continue to hire, and we look forward to program services once again being fully functioning to the benefit of all Americans,\" said USCIS Spokesman Michael Bars in a statement. \"Those forcing a government shutdown in order to protest border security only hurt the interests of the people they're supposed to put first,\" Bars added. Despite the E-Verify outage and other issues, immigration hard-liners think it would be a mistake for the president to back down from his demands for a border wall now. \"There's a bigger point that both the president and the Democrats are trying to make,\" said Mark Krikorian, executive director of the Center for Immigration Studies, which favors lower levels of immigration. Krikorian is a big fan of E-Verify. He'd like the program to be mandatory all over the country. But if it has to be shut down for a few weeks to make a point, Krikorian says, so be it. \"It's unfortunate,\" Krikorian said. \"But it's just part of the larger problem of having this kind of game of chicken over policy questions.\"",

The U.S. Supreme Court hears arguments Tuesday in a highly anticipated set of cases that threatens the legal status of some 700,000 young immigrants \u2014 often called DREAMers \u2014 who were brought to the U.S. illegally as children. It's a program that President Trump tried to rescind seven months after taking office, only to have the lower courts block his action. In 2012, President Barack Obama put the program in place to temporarily protect these young people from deportation. If you were in school, were a high school graduate, or had been honorably discharged from the military, and if you passed a background check, you were eligible for temporary legal status and a work permit, renewable every two years. The program is formally known as the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, or DACA. \"Rest easy\" President Trump, from the beginning, seemed conflicted about DACA, caught between the mass deportations he promised his political base during the campaign and his admiration for what so many of the DREAMers have accomplished. These DACA recipients, who come from around the world, have become teachers, psychologists, business owners and doctors. Their successes illustrate the reason that Republicans and Democrats in Congress tried to work out a DACA deal that Trump would sign in 2017. \"Rest easy,\" Trump told the DREAMers in an April 2017 interview with The Associated Press. Trump \"kept waffling back and forth\" But he \"kept waffling back and forth over what he would be willing to accept, and wouldn't be willing to accept,\" in terms of a DACA deal, says Julie Hirschfeld Davis, co-author of Border Wars and congressional editor for The New York Times. At the end of the day, Trump's indecision was so frustrating for Senate Republican leaders that they worked out a compromise with Democrats on their own. Just hours before the deal was to come up for a vote on the Senate floor, however, the administration branded it unacceptable in a midnight press release, according to Davis. Shortly thereafter, then-Attorney General Jeff Sessions announced that the DACA program would end because, he said, it was illegal and unconstitutional to begin with.  \"They are dead wrong ...\" \"They are dead wrong when they say that the DACA program adopted by the Obama administration was illegal,\" says Ted Olson, who served as solicitor general in the George W. Bush administration and is representing DACA plaintiffs in the Supreme Court. Olson points to programs similar to DACA that were put in place by every other president dating back to Dwight Eisenhower. These programs granted temporary legal status, for instance, to 600,000 Cubans in the 1950s and '60s and 1.5 million other undocumented immigrants under another program in the Reagan and George H.W. Bush administrations. Janet Napolitano was secretary at the Department Homeland Security when DACA was created. \"Not only is there a long history of deferring action for particular groups under the immigration laws,\" says Napolitano, \"but there's the whole concept of prosecutorial discretion, which gives the executive branch the authority to make decisions about who is going to feel the full brunt of the federal government in an enforcement proceeding, versus not.\"  Prosecutorial discretion vs. \"complete suspension of the law\" \"The Supreme Court has long recognized that there may be a line between prosecutorial discretion, not enforcing the law in every instance, and a complete suspension of the law,\" counters John Eastman, a constitutional law professor at Chapman University who has filed a brief siding with the Trump administration in the DACA case. Eastman maintains that DACA is different from other, similar programs in prior administrations, citing DACA recipients' benefits \u2014 including work authorization, Social Security benefits and tax credits on tax returns \u2014 as different from prior administrations. Napolitano replies that granting temporary legal status to DACA recipients enables them to work, and when they work, they must pay into Social Security and pay taxes. Indeed, government statistics indicate that some 91% of DACA recipients have jobs, allowing them to support their families and generating, over a 10-year period, nearly $60 billion in federal tax revenue that the government stands to lose if the DACA program is abolished. Is this illegally arbitrary? Napolitano is no longer DHS secretary. She is the president of the giant University of California system, including 1,700 students with DACA status. And in that capacity, she is challenging Trump's revocation of the DACA program as so arbitrary and unsupported by stated reasons and data that the revocation is itself illegal. \"If they had done a full policy review and had set forth all their reasons and demonstrated that they had weighed the pros and cons and just came to a different conclusion, they might be able to prevail in this case,\" says Napolitano. \"But they didn't do that. Instead they just simply issued basically a one-sentence order that said since DACA is illegal or was illegal, we're going to undo it.\" Sometimes lost in all the legal discussion are the people whose lives will be affected by the Supreme Court's decision in the DACA case. DACA recipient Mitchell Santos Toledo, brought to the U.S. when he was 2 and now in his last year at Harvard Law School, remembers crying when he received his Social Security card. \"This is home for us. It's not a place I call home. It is home,\" he says. A first-of-its-kind video friend of the court brief filed by United We Dream seeks to highlight other DACA stories. \"We got DACA and it's like we got wings. I am a mom, a wife and a business owner,\" says Angelica Villalobos, who owns an auto repair shop. \"I worked on a project that won two Grammys, \" says Emmanuel A. \"I did some fieldwork picking strawberries. I decided to become a teacher so that students could have that role model,\" says Maricruz R. Public support for DACA is illustrated by a distinct imbalance in friend of the court briefs filed in the case. Six have been filed supporting the administration's position. They include briefs filed by conservative organizations and individuals and a brief filed by 12 Republican-dominated states. A total of 35 briefs have been filed in support of DACA. Among them are briefs filed by higher education associations, health professionals and even briefs filed by more than 145 corporations and business organizations arguing that if the court were to side with the Trump administration and abolish DACA, their companies and industries would be significantly disrupted. A decision on DACA is expected by summer, just as the 2020 election is kicking into high gear. Republicans in Congress may be hoping that the high court will let them off the hook and rule in favor of DACA. Whether the current Supreme Court, dominated by conservative justices inclined to defer to presidential power, fulfills those hopes, however, remains to be seen.",

How \u2014 and to whom \u2014 should America distribute its resources? Who gets to be American? Those were the questions roiling the country 40 years ago this week when Morning Edition debuted. It's a time frame that encompasses most of post-civil rights America, and many of the issues that gripped the nation in 1979 are still being debated today. But some of those issues have mutated in unexpected ways and are playing out in a country that has grown steadily browner, and more queer. Here is our survey of some of the major issues involving race and identity from the past 40 years. Busing During those first weeks of November 1979, Pittsburgh had just approved a plan to integrate its schools via busing. And busing was the unspoken subtext of the mayoral race in Boston, where opposition to integration through the decade had turned violent. Around the country, cities and counties were reckoning with the logistics and politics of integrating their schools in the name of equity. With some distance, it's clear that the opponents of busing effectively won those battles; American schools are more segregated now than at any point since the 1960s. Nikole Hannah-Jones of The New York Times wrote this summer that efforts to frame continued segregation as a \"failure of busing\" obscure how organized and intentional the opposition was. \"The same people who claim they are not against integration, just busing as the means, cannot tell you what tactic they would support that would actually lead to wide-scale desegregation,\" she wrote. \"It is unlikely that we will ever again see an effort to deconstruct our system of caste schools like what we saw between 1968 and 1988. But at the very least, we should tell the truth about what happened.\" The political fallout from those battles has had a long shelf life. During the Democratic debates this summer, Joe Biden (the Democratic front-runner) was called out for his previous vocal opposition to busing by Sen. Kamala Harris, who as a child was bused to her public school. Immigration In 1979, as now, the country was gearing up for a presidential election that would shape the next decade of American life. Ronald Reagan, the Republican vying for the presidential nomination, was trying to stitch together a coalition made up of religious conservatives and opponents of the civil rights revolution of the 1960s. (Reagan, who had been a critic of the Voting Rights Act of 1964 because he thought it was unfair to the South, dogwhistled to anti-integrationists by stumping for \"states rights\" in Mississippi not far from where three voting rights activists had been killed the decade prior.) But after he won the White House, his administration would grant blanket legalization to millions of people living in America without legal documentation. Republican presidential nominee Ronald Reagan and wife Nancy share a rocking chair presented to them during their visit to the Neshoba County Fair in Mississippi. The Reagans' visit marked the first time a major party nominee had ever addressed the fair.\n                \n                    \n                    Bettmann Archive\n                    \n                \nhide caption Indeed, Reagan's vice president and successor in the White House, George H.W. Bush, staked out the same moderate position on immigration. (In 1990, he signed a bill into law that would ease the restrictions on undocumented people whose relatives had been legalized by Reagan's amnesty.) \"The Republican Party of Ronald Reagan and George H.W. Bush was a party that was saying, 'we can lock up the Latino vote,' \" Maria Hinojosa, the host of Latino USA, told Morning Edition. To win over white voters who were beginning to defect from the Democratic Party, Bill Clinton positioned himself to the right of Bush and Reagan on immigration. Clinton ran on cracking down on illegal immigration, and in 1996 he signed a bill into law that made it harder for people to become legal citizens while making it easier for them to be deported. Deportation went from a relatively rare outcome for undocumented people to a more common one. George W. Bush \u2014 again, a Republican \u2014 followed Bill Clinton in the White House and seriously considered loosening restrictions on undocumented migrant workers in the United States. He met with Vicente Fox, then-president of Mexico, to discuss the issue, which had considerable political upside on both sides of the southern border. \"Bush envisions Republican victories in 2004 and beyond if the party can boost its share of the growing Latino vote; and Fox believes migration is an issue that can re-energize his sagging presidency back home,\" Robert S. Leiken wrote for Brookings in 2001. \"In a sense, they are trying to ride each other's coattails.\" But the date on that pending meeting proved to be inauspicious: Sept. 2, 2001. Just weeks later, the Bush administration would adopt a more comprehensively aggressive posture toward immigrants and foreigners in the United States as the country began the march toward wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. Undocumented immigrants would be rounded up in the name of national security, and travel in and out of the United States became more closely policed. Deportation counts are complicated numbers, but the Obama administration would continue along this same trajectory that began during the Clinton years, setting records for deportations from the United States. Today, opposition to immigration is a defining feature of the Republican Party \u2014 when just a few decades ago, it was not hard to find elected Republicans who were more liberal on immigration than Democrats. LGBTQIA rights Obergefell v. Hodges, the landmark 2015 Supreme Court decision that legalized same-sex marriage, would have been unthinkable just a generation ago. The public perception of queer people had shifted dramatically: In 1994, most Americans thought homosexuality should not be accepted. By 2017, about 70% felt it should. And Gen Zers, the generation that follows millennials, are both more likely to identify as queer and are much more likely to say they know someone who uses a gender-neutral pronoun than any generation before them. Same-sex marriage supporters rejoice after the U.S Supreme Court hands down a ruling regarding same-sex marriage outside the Supreme Court in Washington on June 26, 2015.\n                \n                    \n                    Alex Wong/Getty Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption The story of rising queer acceptance over the past four decades is often told triumphantly \u2014 like a parade of dramatic legal and political victories \u2014 or in a way that suggests that acceptance has been equally enjoyed. Gen Xers and millennials, who came of age in a post-AIDS world, learned about and discussed sex and sexuality in fundamentally different ways than baby boomers and the Greatest Generation. More prominent, less vulnerable Americans \u2014 Ellen DeGeneres, as one major example \u2014 were coming out. And in 2003, Lawrence v. Texas, a landmark Supreme Court case that effectively decriminalized homosexuality, softened the ground for later gay-rights goals, such as same-sex marriage. But it's worth looking back on how precarious life was and continues to be for many LGBTQIA people. In the early 1980s, outbreaks of what was initially \u2014 and disparagingly \u2014 called \"gay plague\" began popping up all over the country. The Reagan administration's early inaction helped those early outbreaks explode into the AIDS crisis, which would define the politics of queer life. (Reagan's onetime friend, the movie star Rock Hudson, would die of the disease; the Reagans did not respond to requests from Hudson's family for help.) The fear of the poorly understood disease would help further stigmatize queer communities. Some religious conservatives attributed the disease to God's wrath for their supposed sinfulness. (The AIDS crisis has gone on to become increasingly racialized; in recent years, black and Latinx men and black women represent the majority of new diagnoses.) This, of course, coincided with Clinton-era policies such as \"don't-ask-don't-tell,\" which effectively forced queer service members to hide their identities lest they lose their careers, and Clinton's signature of the Defense of Marriage Act, which effectively defined marriage as between one man and one woman. The 1998 murder of Matthew Shepard, and the hate crimes bill it helped catalyze, helped shape legal arguments around sexual orientation \u2014 that gay people constituted a protected legal class.",

Forty years ago this week, Morning Edition took the air for the first time just as a big story was breaking \u2014 one that would shock the nation and influence the next four decades of news. It was coming from Iran, a country few Americans paid attention to at that time. A revolution had been underway that year, and on Nov. 4, 1979, a chanting crowd stormed the U.S Embassy in Tehran, taking Americans hostage. They would hold 52 of those hostages, and the attention of the world, for the next 444 days. The crisis colored every phase of the 1980 presidential contest and left a mark on the history of the next four decades. Even this week, Iranians noted the anniversary with street marches and renewed their vintage chants of \"Death to America!\" The news from Washington has been a big part of the 40-year history of Morning Edition. It has featured seven presidents and 10 presidential election cycles, half a dozen wars and as many major scandals and government shutdowns. The stories that really stay with us are the ones that still seem to cast their shadows on our daily lives. In 1979, we were entering an era in which big stories often seemed to last for months and even years. And through these four decades there have been several big, persistent stories that just never seemed to go away. A path cut by the Iran hostage crisis The Iran hostage crisis upset life in America, primarily relating to gas and oil supplies. It had been seven years since the first Arab oil embargo (prompted by U.S. support for Israel) cut the availability of energy in the West and sent prices skyrocketing. During the crisis, it was the Iranians making drivers wait in long gas lines and pay prices unimaginable a few years before.

The Iran story would morph into the Iran-Contra \"arms for hostages\" scandal in 1986 and 1987. Then the Persian Gulf became the battleground for a war to liberate Kuwait from invading Iraqis in 1990 and 1991 (not long after Morning Edition had celebrated its 10th anniversary in 1989). The disruption in that region influenced the rise of a group called al-Qaida, which plotted and executed the world-changing terrorist attacks of Sept. 11, 2001. That began the long U.S. involvement in Afghanistan that continues today and pushed the U.S. toward another war with Iraq in 2003. American troops have been in Iraq or neighboring Syria ever since. In these years of the \"war on terror,\" Americans came to know the words \"homeland security.\" It was the title of a huge new federal department, but it was also a catchphrase for all of the ways we no longer felt safe in our way of life. In recent years, those ways came to include renewed doubts about immigration, especially undocumented immigrants and asylum-seekers. A successful presidential campaign in 2016 would feature rallies with chants of \"Build that wall!\" Anxiety and distrust extended to trade with other countries. After decades of increasingly free trade and its benefits for the global economy, the concept would become cast as suspect, a threat to American power and prosperity. Tariffs, a policy staple of the past, made a comeback. The phenomenon was by no means exclusive to the U.S., as the United Kingdom voted in the \"Brexit\" referendum to redefine its relations with the European Union. Reps. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., Katherine Clark, D-Mass., and Veronica Escobar, D-Texas, take a selfie during a group photo of House Democrats in the Capitol Visitor Center wearing \"suffragette white\" to the 2019 State of the Union address.\n                \n                    \n                    Tom Williams/CQ-Roll Call/Getty Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption Women in Washington But there were other stories of change that became, in themselves, constants in the news of the nation's capital. There was a distinct sea change in the roles of women in Washington. The number of women in the Senate and the House has grown by more than tenfold. We have seen the first female speaker of the House, the first women nominated by the major parties for vice president and the first woman nominated by a major party for president. Take it from NPR's own Linda Wertheimer, who was covering Congress for the network when Morning Edition had its debut. She was asked whether Congress has changed in these four decades: \"The power of the place tends not to change very much. But I think the presence of women has changed the product that the Congress produces. It's one of the reasons women have more rights now; legislation has passed that women have supported and women have pushed. That's a big difference.\" But Wertheimer has also witnessed and noted another trend of the era. There has been a distinct widening of the divide between the major parties and a decline in the civility of the national political discourse. Police officers separate supporters of George W. Bush and Al Gore during demonstrations in front of the U.S. Supreme Court on Dec. 1, 2000, in Washington, D.C.\n                \n                    \n                    Mark Wilson/Getty Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption Civility and bringing the \"war\" to Congress Some would trace this sharpening of the national debate to the disputed presidential election of 2000, when Morning Edition took the air for five solid weeks without a winner in that year's presidential election. The Supreme Court stepped in, stopped the re-counting of votes in Florida and awarded the presidency to George W. Bush. Others look back further, to the early 1990s, when the first President Bush lost his reelection bid to Bill Clinton (with an assist to the independent billionaire candidate H. Ross Perot). Still others point to the atmospheric change in Congress when Republican Newt Gingrich became speaker in 1995, ending 40 years of Democratic majorities in that chamber. \"Newt Gingrich was elected and he brought war to the Congress,\" Wertheimer says. \"I think that changes a lot of things. Congress is sort of a hotbed of nastiness these days. There's just such a lot of hostility, which was not the case when I first arrived.\" It might also be said that the divide has widened as the issues themselves have become more contentious and personal. Disputes over fiscal and foreign policy now seem relatively manageable when compared to confrontations over gun violence, sexual identity and abortion. No one hearing that first broadcast of Morning Edition 40 years ago could have imagined that someday they would look back on those days as a simpler time.",

Updated on 10/3/19 at 11:20 a.m. ET President Trump made building a border wall between the U.S. and Mexico a cornerstone of his 2016 presidential campaign. But when, after the election, efforts to build the wall stalled, he turned to other possible options \u2014 including constructing a trench filled with snakes and alligators \u2014 according to a forthcoming book. \"He would raise this idea of a trench \u2014 and [that] maybe we could have a water-filled trench,\" New York Times journalist Julie Hirschfeld Davis tells Fresh Air. \"And he raised [the idea] so many times that actually his aides finally went and got a cost estimate for what a trench would cost.\" Davis notes that thoughts of a border trench were cast aside after it was estimated that it would cost three times as much as a wall. Davis and her Times colleague Michael Shear have covered the Trump administration from its earliest days. They chronicle the president's attempts to upend the nation's immigration system in their new book, Border Wars: Inside Trump's Assault on Immigration, publishing on Oct. 8. According to Davis and Shear, Trump sees a border wall as something more than a physical barrier. \"The wall, in his view, should not just be a structure that would stop people on the other side, but that anybody who tried to climb it would be hurt severely,\" Shear says. To that end, they say, the president has proposed electrifying the wall or topping it with spikes and sharp concertina wire that would cut anyone who tried to climb it. He once suggested to now former Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen that the wall be painted a \"flat black\" that would heat up in the sun and burn anyone who touched it, they note. \"At one point, he actually publicly said that when migrants would throw rocks at the military or the border guards, that the military should just respond with rifles, implying that they should just kill them in response,\" Shear tells Fresh Air. Shear notes that when aides told Trump that they could not respond to rock throwing with lethal force, the president backed down \u2014 but only slightly. \"He suggested, 'Well, why don't we just shoot them in the leg? That'll slow them down,'\" Shear says. \"The aides sort of sat there kind of slack jawed and finally said to him, 'No, sir, you can't do that either.'\" Inside Trump's Assault on Immigration by Julie Hirschfeld Davis and Michael D. Shear Hardcover, 466 pages | Your purchase helps support NPR programming. How? On why they believe members of the Trump administration who questioned his judgement on immigration issues didn't sound the alarm more aggressively or publicly Shear: We talked to about 150 people, ultimately, for the book. And I think there were a lot of them that were inside the administration who sort of rationalized staying by thinking to themselves, 'If I leave, the person that he's going to get [as a replacement] is going to only be more willing to do the kinds of things that we don't think he can do.' And these were complicated people who both agreed, in some cases, with the end goal that the president might want to achieve. Meaning, for example, reducing the level of immigration, or making it harder for an asylum seeker to come into the United States. They were frustrated by the process and the means that the president reached for to do it. And they sort of decided to themselves, 'Well, if I leave, it's just more of a runway for him to do whatever the heck he wants, and so I'll stay and be that check.' On how Trump pressured now former Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen into overseeing the family separation directive Shear: The president really is like a bully, and beats his own people into submission. [Nielsen] agonized over that policy, to be clear, not on moral grounds. In the month that the memo authorizing this was on her desk, we found little evidence that she struggled with whether it was right or wrong to separate families. In fact, what she struggled with was whether it could be done, whether it was practical, whether there would be all sorts of problems in the end. And the president and his aides just relentlessly beat her into submission. Not in a literal sense, but phone calls, repeatedly urging her, 'You've got to do this, get off your butt, the president wants this to happen, and you are the one standing in the way.' We document a cabinet meeting in which he wanted to do all sorts of immigration things, closing the border down, and doing things that she kept saying to him in the middle of this cabinet meeting that he can't do. He absolutely relentlessly excoriated her in front of the entire cabinet for close to an hour, leading to her almost resigning right after that. And I think that's what happened in so many cases, is that they give up, and they just say, 'You know what? Fine, I'm going to sign the order.' On top immigration adviser Stephen Miller being a propagator of selective data regarding immigration Davis: This was one of Stephen Miller's specialties, really, and it dates back to when he was on Capitol Hill and he used to circulate emails to journalists with all this very unfavorable data about immigrants and immigration and the effect on American citizens in the U.S. economy. But in the book we talk a lot about how Miller targeted the refugee resettlement program, and really had a goal of cutting down drastically on the amount of refugees that got admitted to the country every year. And one of the ways in which he tried to do that was to talk up the costs of the program and sort of escalate and intensify all of the fears that were out there particularly among the anti-immigration crowd about refugees and what threats they might pose to the country. So within this process as the National Security Council debated what the refugee ceiling should be for the coming fiscal year, Stephen Miller wanted to have a study that showed that refugees cost the economy a lot of money. And he also wanted data in there about the relatively larger threat they posed relative to other immigrants. The problem with both of those was that there was not government data to actually back that up. On their goals when they interviewed Trump for the book Davis: What we really wanted to hear him reflect on was whether he had any regrets about any of these policies or the way that they unfolded. This was at the time, when we went in to speak with him, when the pictures were just being released of all of the shelters with squalid conditions, with children who were dirty and didn't have the right supplies at the border. It was really a horrifying set of images that were coming out. And we really wanted to hear him grapple with what the results have been of his push for some of these policies. We wanted to hear him talk about that, and about whether he had any regrets about the family separation policy. And really whether he was at all concerned or afraid that his legacy on immigration was going to be one of having sort of totally reordered the country's values and made it a place that was not welcoming to immigrants. ... And what was interesting was, he was very unwilling to grapple with any of those ideas. When he talked about the conditions at the border, he talked about, you know, [that] this is all Obama's fault. And the family separation thing that was just a policy that President Obama had in place, which, of course, is false. But he really seemed to be in a parallel universe when it came to what the real-world results had been of his agenda. And he had no regrets about the way that it played out \u2014 at least none that he would admit to. On Trump tweeting \"The press has gone Crazy\" in response to their reporting Davis: We have not gone crazy. We've gotten everything in the book from multiple officials. But interestingly, when we have presented detailed accounts of what we learned to the White House both right before the book was submitted and right before this article was ready to go into the paper, we never got a denial. We never got any kind of dispute of the facts that we have in there. Shear: And, in fact, the half-hour interview that we had with the president in the Oval Office back in June came after we had submitted a detailed list of scenes in the book \u2014 including the moat, and the alligators, and the snakes \u2014 to the White House. And he never raised it with us. So it's interesting that obviously now he's taking issue with it. Sam Briger and Joel Wolfram produced and edited this interview for broadcast. Bridget Bentz, Seth Kelley and Meghan Sullivan adapted it for the Web.",

General Assembly in 2017. The United Kingdom and the United States are about to be led by two remarkably similar figures. At a time of polarization and political chaos, the United Kingdom and the United States are about to be led by two remarkably similar figures. On Tuesday, Britain's ruling Conservative Party elected Boris Johnson as their leader by an overwhelming margin, sending him to No. 10 Downing Street. He will take office on Wednesday. Like Trump, Johnson is a larger-than-life populist who has made controlling immigration and restoring his nation's standing in the world key issues in recent years. (Unlike Trump, he is given to speaking in Latin, making ancient historical allusions and has written a biography of Winston Churchill). Johnson has been accused of extramarital affairs, and he has a reputation for playing fast and loose with the facts. Last week, Trump predicted Johnson would \"do a great job\" and that they would get along well. \"He's a different kind of guy, but they say I'm a different kind of guy, too,\" Trump said. Johnson leaves his office on Monday in London. He will take office on Wednesday.\n                \n                    \n                    Dan Kitwood/Getty Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption Johnson leaves his office on Monday in London. He will take office on Wednesday. How these men have come to lead their countries says a lot about the political forces roiling much of the West in recent years. By 2016, the U.S. and the U.K. were poised for political earthquakes. Key groups of voters in both countries were frustrated with establishment politics, suffering from the negative effects of globalization and worried that foreigners would change their communities. Johnson and Trump responded. On the campaign trail, Trump famously promised to build a wall along the Mexican border to keep out undocumented immigrants, saying that Mexicans were \"bringing drugs. They're bringing crime. They're rapists.\" In Britain, Johnson helped lead the Brexit campaign, vowing to take back control of the country's borders by leaving the European Union, the political and economic union that allows people and goods to move freely among all 28 member states. The Brexit campaign suggested that Turkey would join the European Union and become a back door for Syrian refugees to enter the United Kingdom. \"That's scare-mongering, Boris, and you should be ashamed,\" London Mayor Sadiq Khan said in a debate days before the referendum. \"As far as I know, the last time I looked, the government wants to accelerate Turkish membership,\" Johnson shot back. In fact, Turkish membership in the EU is not remotely on the horizon. Like Trump, Johnson has also emphasized his unease with the changing face of his homeland, using language that plays well with much of his white base but angers minorities and urban liberals. For instance, in his column in The Daily Telegraph, Johnson wrote in 2017 that women in burqas look like mailboxes or bank robbers. Paul Whiteley, a professor of government at the University of Essex, says Johnson's message was clear: \"The 'other,' in very broad terms, is a threat,\" Whiteley says. That message is able to resonate in parts of England, Whiteley says, because immigration from Eastern Europe has affected public services, creating long waits for health care and overcrowded classrooms with students who don't have a strong command of English. \"There is a fear in poor communities that the few jobs they have will be taken away by immigrants, but also a cultural change into something that's unrecognizable and alien,\" Whiteley said. Both Johnson and Trump have pledged to return their countries to a mythical, better age. Trump speaks fondly of what he calls the \"old days,\" when Detroit ruled the auto industry, when most people said \"Merry Christmas\" during the holidays and \u2014 as Trump recalls it \u2014 people could just beat up protesters at a political rally. Many Brexiteers see the good old days as the era of World War II, when the U.K. stood up to the Nazis, or even earlier \u2014 the age of the British Empire. Johnson describes Brexit as an opportunity for the United Kingdom to forge an independent future, unshackled from the European Union. \"I think Winston Churchill was absolutely right when he said that the empires of the future would be empires of the mind,\" Johnson said in a 2016 speech. \"In expressing our values abroad, I believe that global Britain is a soft power superpower.\" Brian Klaas, an assistant professor in global politics at University College London, says both Johnson and Trump have tapped into nostalgia for a time when both nations were whiter and more homogeneous. In the case of the U.K., Klaas says there is an added layer of nostalgia for a time when Britain was a global power and punched far above its weight. \"The idea that the U.K. will be independent and powerful once again is a very, very potent one,\" says Klaas, an American, who is the author of The Despot's Apprentice: Donald Trump's Attack on Democracy. As both Trump and Johnson seek to transform their countries, they have also targeted what they describe as the enemies of change. Trump pledged to \"drain the swamp,\" referring to the political class of legislators and lobbyists in Washington. Similarly, Johnson has targeted the Eurocrats in Brussels, whom he made a career of criticizing back in the 1990s, when he was a reporter there for the Telegraph. Today, Johnson portrays the European Union as a well-intentioned peace effort through economic integration that now threatens to become a superstate. \"It's not we who've changed, it's the EU that's changed out of all recognition,\" Johnson said when he launched the Brexit campaign in 2016. \"To keep insisting that the EU is about economics is like saying the Italian mafia is interested in olive oil and real estate.\" Robin Niblett, director of Chatham House, the London think tank, says both men rode a popular backlash against globalization that was brewing in their respective countries. Industries lost jobs to lower-wage countries overseas, hollowing out communities in the American Midwest as well as in the north of England and Wales, areas that voted heavily for Trump or Brexit in 2016. The 2008 global financial crisis also had a big impact. Although the U.S. economy recovered, many Americans never did, while in the U.K., some communities suffered through debilitating cuts in government services and programs. \"It took us 20 years to get into this crisis of disappointment and dissatisfaction bubbling to the surface,\" Niblett says. \"It's going to take us 20 years to get out of it.\" How long Trump and Johnson will lead their countries is another question. Trump heads into the 2020 election with a still-strong economy and facing a divided Democratic Party. Johnson's first task in office will be to try to unravel the Gordian knot that is Brexit, a challenge that has paralyzed British politics for much of the past three years and ended the careers of his two immediate predecessors. But whatever these leaders' political fate, the populist forces that propelled Johnson and Trump to power are likely to endure.",

The growing popularity of FaceApp \u2014 a photo filter app that delights smartphone users with its ability to transform the features of any face, like tacking on years of wrinkles \u2014 has prompted Democratic Sen. Chuck Schumer to call for a federal investigation into the Russia-based company over what he says are potential national security and privacy risks to millions of Americans. \"It would be deeply troubling if the sensitive personal information of U.S. citizens was provided to a hostile foreign power actively engaged in cyber hostilities against the United States,\" Schumer said in a letter to the FBI and the Federal Trade Commission. \"I ask that the FTC consider whether there are adequate safeguards in place to prevent the privacy of Americans using this application, including government personnel and military service members, from being compromised,\" the senator wrote. BIG: Share if you used #FaceApp:The @FBI & @FTC must look into the national security & privacy risks nowBecause millions of Americans have used itIt\u2019s owned by a Russia-based companyAnd users are required to provide full, irrevocable access to their personal photos & data pic.twitter.com/cejLLwBQcr Even as privacy advocates raised security concerns, FaceApp's mug-morphing powers lured celebrities \u2014 or anyone who had their picture saved to their phone \u2014 such as Drake and the Jonas Brothers, to try on graying hair and wrinkles. By Wednesday, FaceApp had topped Apple's and Google's app download charts. Schumer's appeal echoed concerns expressed earlier in the day from the Democratic National Committee, over fears that its artificial intelligence technology could expose vulnerable facial recognition data to a country that launched a hacking campaign against the party during the 2016 election. The DNC has since expanded its cybersecurity efforts, including bringing on chief security officer Bob Lord. In an email sent to 2020 presidential campaign staff Wednesday, Lord urged \"people in the Democratic ecosystem\" against using an app that could have access to its users' photos. \"It's not clear at this point what the privacy risks are, but what is clear is that the benefits of avoiding the app outweigh the risks,\" Lord said in a notice first reported by CNN. \"If you or any of your staff have already used the app, we recommend that they delete the app immediately.\" Prior to the Democratic warnings, FaceApp began responding to a flood of inquiries about whether the company stores user data and where. FaceApp told TechCrunch in a statement that while its research and development team is based in Russia, no user data are transferred there. The company that created FaceApp, known as \"Wireless Labs,\" also claims that \"most images are deleted from our servers within 48 hours from the upload date.\" Founder Yaroslav Goncharov told the website that FaceApp, headquartered in St. Petersburg, uses Amazon's cloud platform and Google Cloud to host the app data, where it processes \"most\" photos. Uploaded photos, FaceApp said, may be stored temporarily for \"performance and traffic\" to ensure users don't repeatedly upload the same photo as the platform completes an edit. Users have expressed concerns that the app has access to their entire respective iOS or Android photo library even if the user sets photo permissions to \"never.\" But FaceApp told TechCrunch that it only processes photos selected by the user \u2014 slurped from their photo library or those captured within the app. Security researchers have done their own work to back that claim. Will Strafach, a security researcher, said he couldn't find evidence that the app uploads the camera roll to remote servers. FaceApp also said that 99% of users don't log in and, for that group of users, it doesn't have access to any identifying data. Many data privacy experts are wary about these kinds of machine-learning apps, especially in a post-Cambridge Analytica era. Last year, Facebook said up to 87 million of its users' personal information was compromised by the third-party data analytics firm after an apparent breach of Facebook's policy. FaceApp's terms of service state that it won't \"rent or sell your information to third-parties outside FaceApp (or the group of companies of which FaceApp is a part) without your consent.\" But it's that parenthetical clause \u2014 giving leeway to an open-ended, unidentified \"group of companies\" \u2014 that raises a red flag for Liz O'Sullivan, a technologist at the Surveillance Technology Oversight Project, and, she said, leaves the door open to another Cambridge Analytica-type scandal. \"My impression of it honestly was shock that so many people were, in this climate, so willing to upload their picture to a seemingly unknown server without really understanding what that data would go to feed,\" she said. \"For all we know, there could be a military application, there could be a police application,\" O'Sullivan said of FaceApp. In the event FaceApp sells its platform to another company, its privacy policy states, \"user content and any other information collected through the service\" are also up for grabs. This app is one of many that leave open the potential to advance facial recognition software that, often unknown to users, is created from a compilation of people's faces. In many cases, O'Sullivan said, the public doesn't find out what information is being collected about them until we see personal data revealed through Freedom of Information Act requests. This month, as NPR has reported, researchers received records through one such request to find that Immigration and Customs Enforcement mines a massive database of driver's license photos in facial recognition efforts that may be used to target undocumented immigrants. Researchers have concluded facial recognition technology is biased and imperfect, putting innocent people at risk. O'Sullivan wants to see more regulation in place that's designed to protect consumers. Like her, many security advocates in the U.S. will be watching Europe's testing ground as lawsuits against tech giants play out under the General Data Protection Regulation, or GDPR, the European Union's sweeping new data privacy law.",

With his latest round of attacks on four first-year members of Congress who are women of color, President Trump has once again touched the raw nerve of racism in American life. He has also tapped into one of the oldest strains in our politics \u2014 the fear and vilification of immigrants and their descendants. Although three of the four women were born in the United States, the president said they should all \"go back\" where they came from. That phrase has echoed down generations of nativist discourse as successive waves of newcomers have been targeted by individuals, groups and even whole political parties. At times, the motivations have been economic, focusing on competition for jobs and such social goods as housing or welfare programs. But there has also been a recurrent theme of cultural differences \u2013 an emphasis on characteristics of religion or language that identify new arrivals as \"the other.\" Anti-immigration sentiments emerged in force starting in the 1830s, when U.S. citizens descended primarily from English and Scottish settlers bridled at the influx of Irish. Most of the arriving Irish were Catholic, prompting a hostile reaction among some Protestants that led to deadly riots in Pennsylvania and Massachusetts. The persistence of such prejudice made \"No Irish Need Apply\" one of the most iconic signs in the national memory. After the Irish, the hostile reaction extended to a surge of new arrivals in the 1840s from Germany, again largely Catholic. In ethnic terms, the Irish and Germans were akin to other colonial Americans (and to immigrants arriving from Scandinavia).  But they were viewed as different, clannish and hard to assimilate. They were seen as not just competing for jobs but as threatening the social, cultural and political order. They were pilloried as susceptible to criminality and drunkenness and seen as loyal to the foreign power of the pope in Rome.

Read the full captions on the Library of Congress website.\n                \n                    \n                    Nathaniel Currier via Library of Congress\n                    \n                \nhide caption In this anti-Catholic cartoon circa 1855, Pope Pius IX steps ashore the United States. Read the full captions on the Library of Congress website. In the 1840s and 1850s, political parties formed in the U.S. to oppose the permissive immigration policies of the time. Some of these parties embraced the term \"Native American,\" spawning the label \"nativist\" that has stuck to succeeding generations of immigration opponents. Perhaps the best known of these was the American Party, which began as a semi-secret society (\"The Order of the Star Spangled Banner\"), with members being told to deny any knowledge of it. When they claimed to \"know nothing\" of the group, they were pilloried as the \"Know Nothing\" party \u2013 a name that would long survive the entity itself. The party railed against the new arrivals as an economic, social and cultural threat that was bringing crime, disease, social unrest and the prospect of political takeover at the local level. A cartoon published in Judge magazine in 1903 is titled \"The High Tide of Immigration \u2014 A National Menace,\" with the caption: \"Immigration statistics for the past year show that the influx of foreigners was the greatest in our history, and also that the hard-working peasants are now being supplanted by the criminals and outlaws of all Europe.\"\n                \n\n                    The Ohio State University, Billy Ireland Cartoon Library and Museum\n                    \n\nhide caption A cartoon published in Judge magazine in 1903 is titled \"The High Tide of Immigration \u2014 A National Menace,\" with the caption: \"Immigration statistics for the past year show that the influx of foreigners was the greatest in our history, and also that the hard-working peasants are now being supplanted by the criminals and outlaws of all Europe.\" The Know Nothings had attracted scores of members of the U.S. Congress at the height of their influence in the mid-1850s, stepping into the vacuum left by the collapse of the Whigs. In 1856, they nominated Millard Fillmore, a former president and former Whig, as their national candidate. Fillmore got 21% of the popular vote but only a handful of Electoral College votes, as many of the Know Nothings crossed over to vote for John Fremont, the first nominee of the fledgling Republican Party. The 1860s brought the Civil War and a desperate need for soldiers, leading to greater acceptance of new arrivals who were willing to join the Union Army. In the years that followed, some immigrants found acceptance as veterans, others made their way west to farm the interior or work in its burgeoning cities. The Know Nothings were not an organized force again after the Civil War, but resistance to immigration never left the national conversation. The importation of Asians to work on the Western railroads and harvests introduced another enduring chapter of American nativism. The Chinese Exclusion Act of 1882 was the first legislation to restrict immigration based on nation of origin. Some of the jobs denied to Chinese workers were soon filled by Mexicans. Toward the end of the 1800s, the flow of immigrants from Europe swelled again and changed in its origin. The new arrivals now hailed from Eastern and Southern Europe, as well as from countries that had been sending opportunity seekers across the Atlantic for generations. The proportion of U.S. residents who were foreign-born hit 13.5% in the census report of 1911, the highest it had ever been and a level not reached again until the present decade. When the World War I ended, anti-immigration sentiment reached a new level of intensity as it swept much of the country, helping to fuel a resurgence of the Ku Klux Klan among other extremist groups. An old association of immigration and urbanization was renewed when the census of 1920 showed immigrants had helped shift the center of U.S. population from rural areas to cities and big towns. Congress, dominated by members from rural, traditional parts of the country, simply refused to reapportion its seats and redraw election districts to reflect the new numbers. That refusal lasted through four biennial election cycles, during which time Congress also passed an emergency ceiling on annual immigration levels and then lowered that by half again in the Immigration Act of 1924. That law set quotas by country of origin and explicitly preferred Northern Europeans over all others. The official attitude in the 1920s and 1930s included an ambivalence toward refugees from conflicts around the world. In 1939, a German ship called the St. Louis tried to make port in Florida with more than 900 passengers, most of them Jewish refugees seeking asylum from Nazi persecution in Germany. U.S. officials in the administration of President Franklin Roosevelt refused to let them land. They tried to persuade Cuba to take them, but without success. The ship returned to Europe, where many of the passengers were later arrested. Researchers believe that more than 250 perished in the Holocaust. A generation later, in 1965, Congress passed a more liberal immigration law that eliminated quotas based on nation of origin. The law sought to reunite families and level the playing field for prospective immigrants around the world \u2013 and its impact went far beyond what its sponsors might have imagined. The proportion of foreign-born in the U.S. population rose again from just 5% in 1965 to 14% over the next half century. And these new waves of arrivals would be far more diverse than their predecessors were. They came not only from different parts of Europe but from Asia, Africa and South America as well. By the 1970s, the political focal point was the effect the law was having on the Southwest and the influx of Mexicans and other Spanish-speaking populations. Pressure for changing the law grew as latter-day nativists again saw the new arrivals as a social, cultural and political challenge. Many of the same arguments made against previous generations of newcomers were lodged again against Hispanics, including that they would cling to their national culture and language and refuse to assimilate. Labor groups also sought to control the competition from workers willing to take lower wages. But there were powerful business interests, particularly from the agricultural sector, determined to preserve access to migrant workers. In 1986, the Simpson-Mazzoli Act sought to control future immigration, but also granted amnesty to millions of the undocumented people who were already residents. President Ronald Reagan signed it into law. It was a compromise meant to appease all sides, but it satisfied few. President George W. Bush, who had long enjoyed high levels of Hispanic support as a candidate in Texas, threw his support behind a comprehensive overhaul of immigration laws in the mid-2000s. He was joined by Republican rival Sen. John McCain of Arizona and by the Democratic leadership. But conservatives more generally opposed the bill as another extension of amnesty, despite all the sponsors' denials. Since then, the Republican Party has moved far from the Reagan-Bush-McCain attitudes on immigration and embraced the nativist tradition that has also been an element in the mix of its history back to 1856. Declaring his presidential candidacy in June of 2015, Trump issued his much-quoted summary of immigrants: \"When Mexico sends its people, they're not sending their best. They're not sending you. They're not sending you. They're sending people that have lots of problems and they're bringing those problems with us. [sic] They're bringing drugs. They're bringing crime.  They're rapists. And some, I assume, are good people. \"It's coming from more than Mexico. It's coming from all South and Latin America, and it's coming, probably, probably, from the Middle East. But we don't know, because we have no protection, and we have no competence and we don't know what's happening.\" By repeating that these immigrants are \"not ...  you,\" the president defined these immigrants as \"the other\" in stark terms. In the past two days, we have seen the president return to that blunt language in describing four women who were elected to Congress in November 2018, largely on the passion of their opposition to the nativism that he, and much of his party, have embraced. The battle lines could not be clearer. And it is a battle that is nearly as old as America itself.",

A new generation of migrants is arriving in Mexico: young adults who were born in Mexico, raised in the United States and are now returning \u2014 some voluntarily, some by force \u2014 to the country of their birth. They've been dubbed \"Generation 1.5.\" With only limited support available from the Mexican government for these often well-educated returnees, several nongovernmental organizations and at least one private company are looking to help them out and take advantage of their skills. At the start-up Hola Code in Mexico City, 20 or so young people in a conference room pepper their instructor with questions about coding and finding jobs in Mexico's software industry. Their queries flicker between Spanish and English. \"How long does the whole interview process take? What do they ask you?\" Students work on their final thesis at Hola Code on May 13.

Hola Code is a software engineering program focused on integrating former migrants who returned or were deported to Mexico. These students are former migrants who have been deported or who returned voluntarily and hope to turn their U.S. experience into a tech career. Among them are several DREAMers \u2014 young people who were brought to the U.S. illegally as children and later protected from deportation by the Obama administration's Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, or DACA. The Trump administration tried to cancel DACA in 2017, but that effort is being challenged in the courts. Still, under President Trump, DACA protection has become much more precarious. Marcela Torres, the CEO of Hola Code, says she founded the company in 2017 when she saw that the Mexican government wasn't doing enough to assist returnees, many of whom could barely speak Spanish. \"The brutality of arriving to a country that you don't know and it's supposed to be your home and it's not ready for you is incredible,\" says Torres. \"And the amount of people coming back is also very large to the extent that if Mexico doesn't do something about this, it's going to be an entire generation that gets lost.\" Programming signs hang on the walls of Hola Code.\n                \n                    \n                    Alicia Vera for NPR\n                    \n                \nhide caption Programming signs hang on the walls of Hola Code. In response to the growing number of returnees, the Mexican government in 2014 launched a program called Somos Mexicanos aimed at helping returning migrants integrate into Mexican society, offering things like health services, phone access and local transportation, but critics say the program has been ineffective and underfunded. In addition to software training, Hola Code provides meals, banking services, yoga classes and mental health support during its five-month program. Students don't pay for classes until they land a job, often with one of the company's 116 hiring partners. In the coming weeks, about 100 students will have completed training with Hola Code, according to Torres. Torres says her start-up is meant to help anchor new arrivals. These binational migrants, she points out, often describe themselves as de aqu\u00ed y all\u00e1 \u2014 \"from here and there,\" the U.S. and Mexico. But, she adds, they can also feel like they are neither from here nor from there. Mexico needs these new arrivals, says Torres, noting that thousands of tech jobs go unfilled because of a lack of qualified applicants. Marcela Torres poses for a portrait at Hola Code.

Gage says he enjoyed DACA protection until a few nights before Christmas in 2017, when he popped across the border into Tijuana to have dinner with friends, as he often did. On the way back, he says, he was stopped, questioned and denied reentry by a border agent. \"They told us, 'Well, new Trump policy \u2014 your visa's going to get canceled,\" Gage says. Gage says the border agent made it all up. U.S. Customs and Border Protection says that when Gage presented himself at the border, CBP officers determined that he was out of status for his visa and it was canceled. Gage's lawyer told him that border agents have complete autonomy to deny entry for any reason and that he had simply been unlucky. Suddenly in need of an income, including money to pay for his diabetes medication, Gage moved to Mexico City. At first, he tried the job that many English-speaking migrants take upon arrival \u2014 a job at an international call center. He says it was mind numbing. Then he became a bike messenger. The pay was better, but with the Mexico City traffic and his lack of insurance, it did not seem like a good career move. Then one day a friend from the U.S. came for a visit. \"We were talking, and he was like, 'Hey, dude, I heard about this program, Hola Code. The info session is tomorrow night. Let's go visit it.' And I read about the program, and I was like, 'This is too good to be true.' And I was like, 'There are other people like me that have gone through the same, and, well, these guys are already getting tech jobs. Like, wow, I cannot let this go.' \" Andrea Bautista agrees with Hola Code's Torres that Mexico is not doing enough to help people like Gage. A researcher at the Colegio de M\u00e9xico who studies migration, she says the returnees have trouble accessing the necessary documents to get basic services like education and health care and so end up undocumented in their home country too. \"Having these people come back who have this profile and level of education ... we don't know how to deal with them or integrate them,\" says Bautista. \"And that's the problem \u2014 a lot remains to be done to get them into the system ... and to take advantage of their abilities.\" Mexico is already feeling the influence of these returnees. In the heart of Mexico City is a new community that has come to be known as Little LA. It's a part of the city where many call centers are located and English-speaking workers congregate at food stalls featuring Tex-Mex cuisine that offers a taste of home. Mauricio Lopez, a former DREAMer himself, says Little LA has become a refuge for members of Generation 1.5, who often feel like they don't quite fit in. Lopez moved to Mexico in 2017 after growing tired of living with the fear that everything would be taken away from him under the Trump administration. \"Trump, he was the one who basically initiated all this, because as a community, we cannot just stand there and watch our people being discriminated, treated like animals,\" says Lopez. He now works at New Comienzos, or New Beginnings, an organization that helps the returnee population. He says people like him back in the States, worried about their immigration status, are reaching out. \"They contact us all the time. 'Hey, I'm thinking of going back to Mexico. What do you have there?' \" Students work on their final thesis at Hola Code.\n                \n                    \n                    Alicia Vera for NPR\n                    \n                \nhide caption Students work on their final thesis at Hola Code. Back at Hola Code, Gage will soon be graduating from the program, and he's thinking about his future, maybe even starting his own business. Like other members of Generation 1.5, he's hoping Mexico can find a place for him. \"I want to do my best always. I think that's the most valuable thing any DREAMer, any migrant, has, because if you see anyone who goes to the States, [it's] because they want a better life,\" says Gage. \"I think that sense is something that's part of you, and I want to do something great with it.\" This story was produced as part of a collaboration with PBS NewsHour.",

            "article_content": "Updated Sept. 13, 3:55 p.m. ET The Trump administration has pushed to reshape the nation's approach to immigration \u2014 right down to how to read the words engraved on a bronze plaque at the Statue of Liberty. \"Give me your tired and your poor who can stand on their own two feet and who will not become a public charge,\" Ken Cuccinelli, acting director of U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, said in an interview with NPR's Morning Edition last month. The administration has tried every tool at its disposal to tighten the nation's immigration policies \u2014 including the so-called \"public charge\" rule that makes it harder for immigrants to get green cards or visas if they use a wide range of public assistance. It also has pushed to ramp up enforcement, carrying out the biggest workplace raids in at least a decade. At the same time, many of the administration's efforts have been stalled or blocked by Congress, the courts, or state and local officials. Below is a look at what the White House has accomplished on immigration \u2014 and what it hasn't. Loading... Don't see the graphic above? Click here. Asylum Crackdown The southern border is effectively closed to the vast majority of migrants seeking asylum after the Supreme Court allowed a new Trump administration policy to go into effect while a legal challenge plays out in court. That new asylum rule says that immigration authorities can deny asylum to migrants arriving at the U.S.-Mexico border unless they have first applied for protections in a country they crossed on the way to the United States. The new policy had been put on hold in part by a federal judge in California, who found it \"inconsistent with the existing asylum laws.\" But the high court stayed that injunction, allowing the new rule to take effect for now. The asylum rule is one of many of efforts by the administration to discourage migrants from seeking asylum in the U.S. The White House argues that many migrants are abusing generous asylum laws to live and work in the country until their cases are heard in immigration court, which can take years because of extensive backlogs. The White House says Guatemala has also signed a so-called \"safe third country asylum agreement.\" The deal would require migrants traveling through Guatemala from countries such as Honduras and El Salvador to claim asylum in Guatemala before trying in the U.S.  Though it's not clear whether the agreement is legal, as the Guatemalan Congress is supposed to ratify such treaties, or how it will be implemented. Courts have previously rejected other policies that would limit asylum, including the administration's attempt to deny refuge to any migrant who crossed the border illegally. But the Justice Department has succeeded in making it harder to get asylum based on gang or domestic violence, as well as family ties. The DOJ also pushed to get rid of bond hearings for detained asylum-seekers, but has been blocked from doing so. And the administration wants to hold migrant families with children in detention until their day in immigration court to discourage them from coming. Workplace Raids Federal immigration officials raided seven food-processing plants in Mississippi in August, arresting about 680 people believed to be working in the U.S. without authorization, and also seizing company business records. More than 600 agents from U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement were involved in the operation. They were by far the largest workplace raids of the Trump administration, and the biggest since 2006. ICE later released hundreds of those who were arrested with orders to appear in immigration court. But the raids left many of their family members scrambling for support. The owners of the poultry-processing plants have yet to be charged with any wrongdoing. Family Detention The Trump administration is moving to end a long-standing legal agreement known as the Flores settlement that limits how long migrant families with children can be detained. Under Flores, the government has to release migrant kids from detention centers as quickly as possible, generally within 20 days. New regulations proposed by the Department of Homeland Security would lift that limit and make other major changes as well. This has been a longtime goal of immigration hardliners in the Trump administration, who argue that Flores has acted as a lure to families in Central America. Doctors and immigrant advocates argue that detention is extremely harmful to children. A federal judge in California would have to sign off on the new regulations before they take effect. Deportations President Trump has threatened to deport \"millions\" of immigrants living in the country illegally. Arrests and deportations of undocumented immigrants living in the U.S. spiked during the first two years of the Trump administration \u2014 for immigrants with and without criminal records. But the numbers remain well below the highest figures of President Obama's first term. And the acting director of Immigration and Customs Enforcement says arrests and deportations declined in early 2019 because the agency is devoting more resources to the southern border. Also, the administration's plan to undertake nationwide ICE raids to round up undocumented families failed to materialize. The administration is expanding the use of so-called expedited removal to fast-track deportations of immigrants without a hearing before an immigration judge, unless they can prove they've been in the U.S. continuously for more than two years. And immigrant advocates say aggressive enforcement by ICE continues to create a climate of fear among unauthorized migrants. Tariffs on Mexico The White House warned that the U.S. would impose a tariff of 5% on all products from Mexico and escalate it \u2014 unless Mexico agreed to \"substantially\" curtail the flow of Central American migrants Under pressure from Washington, Mexico agreed to step up enforcement and to take in more migrants waiting for their U.S. asylum hearings. Mexico also deployed thousands of troops to its northern and southern borders. And the number of migrants taken into custody after crossing the U.S.-Mexico border began to decline. The monthly total fell in August to just over 64,000 after peaking at more than 144,000 in May \u2014 though the number still remains higher than the same period a year ago. President Trump has threatened several times over the past year to close the southern border unless the Mexican government does more to combat illegal immigration. But the White House backed down under pressure from business groups. Those groups \u2014 and their allies in Congress \u2014 pushed back on the proposed tariffs, as well. Remain in Mexico The Department of Homeland Security has sent more than 30,000 migrants back to Mexico to wait for months until a U.S. immigration court decides their asylum cases. Immigrant advocates, lawyers and former U.S. officials say the country is turning its back on asylum-seekers \u2014 vulnerable people who are allowed under U.S. law to seek sanctuary here. A federal court initially blocked the administration from sending asylum-seekers back to crime-ridden Mexican border towns where many are staying in shelters. But the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals overturned the lower court's injunction, allowing the \"Remain in Mexico\" policy to continue while the case plays out. Meanwhile, immigrant advocates say conditions are worsening for migrants in border towns, targeted by gangs and cartels. Merit-Based System President Trump has laid out sweeping changes he'd like to make to the legal immigration system. The White House proposal would favor immigrants with higher skills and more education, and it would shift the immigration system away from family reunification, which has been its guiding principle since 1965. But the latest proposal is getting little traction on Capitol Hill \u2014 particularly among Democrats, whose support would be necessary for the proposal to become law. Sanctuary Cities Federal courts have widely rejected the Justice Department's attempts to withhold law enforcement grants from so-called sanctuary cities that limit their cooperation with immigration authorities. In April, President Trump threatened to bus migrants from the border and then release them in sanctuary cities. But so far, his administration has not acted on those threats. Family Separation The administration's \"zero tolerance\" policy was intended to deter illegal border crossings by separating migrant parents and children at the border \u2014 until President Trump ended the policy under pressure last June. A federal judge has ordered the administration to reunite nearly 3,000 children with their parents. The same judge has since ordered the administration to identify hundreds of additional families that were separated before the \"zero tolerance\" policy took effect. The ACLU, which challenged the family separation policy, went back to court in July. In court filings, the ACLU argues that the administration has separated more than 900 parents and children and infants since the judge's ruling, many on flimsy legal grounds. The administration concedes that a small number of migrant children are still being separated from their parents at the border \u2014 but only if the parent has a criminal record, or there's another reason that separation is in the best interest of the child. Immigrant advocates say migrant children are also being routinely separated from caregivers at the border \u2014 with older family members being placed in the Remain in Mexico program, while the children they've brought are taken into U.S. custody. The Wall The Supreme Court handed the White House a victory in July when it allowed the Trump administration to use military construction funds to build some sections of the president's border wall while litigation is ongoing. A lower court had initially frozen the $2.5 billion in funds, and an appeals court agreed. But the high court ruled that the Pentagon funds can be tapped for now. The dispute began earlier this year when President Trump declared a national emergency in order to secure funding for his signature immigration policy: the border wall. The Trump administration wants to spend a total of $6 billion from military and counter-drug accounts. That emergency declaration is still being challenged in court by critics who say there is no emergency, and that the president is flouting the will of Congress in order to deliver on a key campaign promise. Lawmakers also have authorized more than $1.3 billion for 55 miles of steel fencing on the U.S.-Mexico border. DACA The Supreme Court will hear arguments next term about the Trump administration's efforts to end Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, or DACA. In the meantime, nearly 700,000 young immigrants who were brought to the country illegally as children are still protected from deportation and allowed to work legally under the program created by President Obama in 2012. The Trump administration tried to end DACA, but has been blocked from doing so by several federal courts. Democrats and moderate Republicans are likely to insist on some relief for DACA recipients as part of any comprehensive immigration overhaul, while immigration hardliners are wary of granting \"amnesty\" or a path to citizenship. Travel Ban The Trump administration's effort to restrict immigration and travel from several majority-Muslim countries was blocked by lower courts. But a modified version \u2014 including the majority-Muslim countries of Libya, Iran, Somalia, Syria and Yemen, plus North Korea and Venezuela \u2014 was upheld by the Supreme Court in a major victory for the White House. Another legal challenge remains after a federal judge in Maryland ruled that lawsuit can go forward. But that could take years, so it may be a long time before people who are affected by the policy see a change, if any. TPS The administration has moved to wind down Temporary Protected Status, or TPS, for more than 400,000 immigrants from countries wracked by civil conflict or natural disasters.The immigrants are protected from deportation and allowed to work in the U.S. A number of legal challenges have been filed. For instance, the Department of Homeland Security has been blocked from ending TPS for immigrants from Haiti, El Salvador, Nicaragua and Sudan by a judge in California. Birthright Citizenship Shortly before the 2018 midterm elections, President Trump threatened to do away with automatic citizenship for anyone born in the United States. He brought up the idea again in August 2019, saying the White House was \"looking very, very seriously\" at abolishing birthright citizenship \u2014 even though the vast majority of legal scholars believe it is guaranteed by the 14th Amendment to the Constitution. So far, the president has not followed through on his threats. The administration has been criticized for ending automatic citizenship for the children of some U.S. military members and government workers overseas. When that policy was first announced, critics of the administration speculated it might be the first step toward ending birthright citizenship \u2014 a charge the administration quickly denied. Public Benefits Homeland Security has released the final version of regulations that would make it easier to deny legal immigrants green cards or visas if they use a wide range of public benefits, such as food stamps and subsidized health insurance. The Trump administration argues the so-called \"public charge\" rule merely enforces a century-old provision in U.S. immigration law that says immigrants should be self-sufficient. But critics say the regulations could dramatically reshape the U.S. immigration system by turning away thousands of immigrants from poorer countries. Multiple lawsuits have been filed to block the regulations, including cases brought by state attorneys general and by advocacy groups. Public Housing Thousands of families that include undocumented members could be forced out of public housing by a rule proposed by the Department of Housing and Urban Development. These families include an estimated 55,000 children who are U.S. citizens or legal residents. The rule is intended to prevent undocumented immigrants or mixed-status families from living in public housing. It's still in the public comment stage, and critics are pressuring HUD Secretary Ben Carson to reconsider. Refugee Cap The Trump administration has slashed the number of refugees the U.S. will accept. The official cap is set at 30,000 for the year, the lowest figure since the current refugee resettlement program began in 1980. That's forcing refugee resettlement offices across the country to close or suspend their services. And the administration is weighing further cuts to the refugee program next year.",

She has been the target of criticism and censure for statements regarded as anti-Semitic.

Ilhan Omar (D-Minn.) is one of the first Muslim women elected to Congress. She has been the target of criticism and censure for statements regarded as anti-Semitic. Many other prominent black Muslim leaders say her experience is familiar. At a rally on Capitol Hill organized by black female leaders in support of Ilhan Omar, the embattled Democratic congresswoman addressed the crowd. \"They cannot stand that a refugee, a black woman, an immigrant, a Muslim shows up in Congress thinking she's equal to them,\" she said, referencing President Trump, members of the Republican Party and even members of her own party. It resonated with many American Muslims and, more specifically, black Muslim women across the country. Many say the storm of criticism around Omar, the first black Muslim woman in Congress, is more about who she is than what she says. \"It's not surprising to me to see because I know what it's like to be a black Muslim woman,\" said Vanessa Taylor, a writer based in Philadelphia who writes about black Muslim womanhood. \"There is this sense that black women have to atone for sins that are constructed elsewhere. So, it's not even a matter of if she actually did ... [what critics accuse her of] or if it's actually a wrong thing to do. It's really just a matter of a black woman's position is to be [one of] atonement.\" And Omar is not atoning. Her prominent presence in Washington is being met with violent death threats, many incited by a video in a tweet by Trump that accused her of minimizing the Sept. 11 attacks. It interspersed footage of Omar speaking with the flaming towers. Her critics accuse her of anti-Semitism. She apologized over an offensive tweet, saying she was grateful to be educated on the painful history of anti-Semitism and anti-Semitic tropes. But she refuses to back down from questioning lobbyists' influence in policymaking, specifically the American Israel Public Affairs Committee. Most recently, when she spoke at the Council on American-Islamic Relations, her words were taken out of context and she was accused of downplaying the Sept. 11 attacks, even though she is the co-sponsor of a bill that seeks to renew the victims' compensation fund. \"For far too long we have lived with the discomfort of being a second-class citizen and, frankly, I'm tired of it, and every single Muslim in this country should be tired of it. CAIR [the Council on American-Islamic Relations] was founded after 9/11 because they recognized that some people did something and that all of us were starting to lose access to our civil liberties,\" she said. Her office later corrected the statement; CAIR was founded before the Sept. 11 attacks. Having to prove patriotism, over and over Her words resonated with many American Muslims who are tired of being asked to prove their patriotism. Movita Johnson-Harrell said the threats and outsize scrutiny are all very familiar. \"Historically we have not occupied these spaces, and now that we are, it is a threat to the misogyny and the white supremacy in this country,\" she said. Johnson-Harrell is the first Muslim woman to serve in the Pennsylvania Statehouse. She's a black woman who wears the religious head covering. For her, it started before she was even sworn in this spring, when Pennsylvania Rep. Stephanie Borowicz gave a now notorious invocation that Johnson-Harrell says made her feel unwelcome and implied that her election was wrong. \"God forgive us \u2014 Jesus \u2014 we've lost sight of you, we've forgotten you, God, in our country, and we're asking you to forgive us, Jesus,\" Borowicz prayed. \"It was laced with bigotry and it was very, very offensive,\" Johnson-Harrell said. Since saying she was offended, she's been inundated. \"I've gotten hate mail,\" she said. \"I've had people put comments on my social media telling me to go back to where I came from, telling me to remove the rag from my head ... I mean, it's been absolutely insane.\" According to writer Vanessa Taylor, the chorus of critics, from both parties, is a familiar tune for black Muslim women in politics. Omar has become a symbol of marginalized people rising to power, she said. \"So that's why we see people reacting so strongly and trying so hard to silence her, whether that is the president of the United States with his tweets or people sending death threats,\" she said. The constant questions that go along with American Muslims seeking a space in public life, it really does take away from people's ability to talk about issues that are really very important to them. Caleb Elfenbein, Grinnell College That silencing effect can be far reaching. \"In general we see a lot of the same kind of treatment [for] Muslims running for public office,\" said Caleb Elfenbein, an associate professor of history and religious studies at Grinnell College. \"That includes [at] the very local level like school boards, all the way up through Congress and lots of things in between.\" He says that impacts the way Muslims feel they need to interact in public life. They spend a lot of their time explaining themselves through things like interfaith groups. \"The constant questions that go along with American Muslims seeking a space in public life, it really does take away from people's ability to talk about issues that are really very important to them,\" Elfenbein said. Virginia legislative race The issues important to Yasmine Taeb are clean energy and getting corporate money out of politics. She's running for Virginia's 35th Senate District. She's a Democrat running against a Democrat. She's also an Iranian American and a Muslim. So the headlines attacking her scream: \"pro-Iran socialist.\" She's accused of hating Israel. But foreign policy has never come up in this race. \"This is a local state legislative race,\" she said, laughing. \"These are dog whistles. These are, you know, Islamophobic tactics.\" She gets messages from across the country calling her a terrorist, trash, asking ICE to deport her. \"Why is it that every single time we have a Muslim declare their candidacy and run for office, why is it that we have to jump this hurdle to prove that we are loyal to this country?\" she asked. There are brief moments, she says, when she wonders if staying in politics is worth it, when she looks at the hundred or so hateful messages she gets each day. \"Then it just makes me remember that it's all the more important why we should,\" she said. \"These are individuals that are trying to silence us. These are individuals that don't support a more inclusive commonwealth and country.\" New openings? But vocal Muslims and people of color, such as Omar and others in public office, also create new openings for discussions on topics that were once taboo on the left and the right. That ranges from Middle East policy vis-a-vis Israel to clean energy, said Ramzi Kassem, a professor of law at the City University of New York, where he co-directs the Immigrant & Non-Citizen Rights Clinic. \"That's a heartening and inspiring development to many who have felt marginalized at all levels of society and who certainly felt that there was no place for them in mainstream U.S. federal politics, that there was no place for them in decision making,\" he said. \"All of a sudden to see these figures at the forefront and not just at the forefront, not just being visible but being vocal as well, putting forward bold and daring new political ideas and programs \u2014 that's going to have a huge mobilizing effect not just on U.S. Muslim youth but really broadly on people of color, on young women who until recently might not have thought of those sorts of things as being within the realm of the possible,\" he added.",

Tobiron Nessa has lived in the same impoverished village in northeast India all her life. So has her husband. They married young and raised five children, and now, at age 45, Nessa is about to become a grandmother. But she has suddenly found herself in an unexpected predicament: Nessa is now the only one in her immediate family whom the Indian government recognizes as a citizen. Her husband and five children have all been left off the National Register of Citizens. The NRC is like a census, but it has only ever been conducted in one Indian state, Assam, which borders Bangladesh and has long received immigrants from there. The NRC process began back in 1951, when Bangladesh was known as East Pakistan. Religion was never a basis of citizenship. But the BJP is making it so, just to show they're pro-Hindu. Aman Wadud, human rights lawyer Ever since, Indian authorities have been trying to figure out who was born in India, whose family has been living in India for generations and who might be an undocumented migrant from what is now Bangladesh. Indian citizenship is generally granted according to parentage rather than location of birth. With some exceptions, people are usually given Indian citizenship if at least one parent is Indian \u2014 though the requirements have become more stringent over the decades. For migrants in Assam, the key date for Indian citizenship is March 24, 1971 \u2014 days before Bangladesh declared independence from Pakistan, leading to a war. People who migrated to India from there before that date are considered Indian citizens. But those who migrated to India after the cutoff date are considered undocumented \u2014 and they are whom the NRC aims to exclude. Families in Assam are required to submit paperwork to prove their Indian citizenship under the NRC. They've done so for decades, but authorities never informed people of whose paperwork passed muster and whose didn't. That is, until the Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party of Prime Minister Narendra Modi came to power \u2014 nationally in 2014 and in Assam's state government in 2016. Last year, for the first time, state authorities issued a preliminary list of citizens. Four million people who thought they were Indian were not on it. Most of those left off the list, like Nessa's family, are Muslim. Targeting Muslims? India's constitution grants people of all faiths equal protection under the law. But Assam's Muslims fear that the NRC is being used to illegally strip them of Indian citizenship and mark them for deportation \u2014 to skew even further the state's demographics in favor of the Hindu majority. Amit Shah, the national president of the Bharatiya Janata Party, seen here last month in Kolkata, has referred to immigrants from Bangladesh as \"termites.\"\n                \n                    \n                    Dibyanshu Sarkar/AFP/Getty Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption Amit Shah, the national president of the Bharatiya Janata Party, seen here last month in Kolkata, has referred to immigrants from Bangladesh as \"termites.\" The BJP seeks a greater role for Hinduism in government and public life. At a campaign rally last month, the party's president explained in no uncertain terms how the NRC might play a role in that mission throughout India. \"These infiltrators are eating away at our country like termites,\" BJP President Amit Shah told rallies on April 11 in the state of West Bengal. \"The NRC is our means of removing them.\" He used the words \"infiltrators\" and \"termites\" to refer to Muslim migrants from Bangladesh who may have entered India illegally. It wasn't the first time he'd referred to such migrants as \"termites,\" something the State Department noted in its 2018 human rights report. Nessa has lived in the same impoverished village in northeast India all her life.

Indian citizenship allows her family to qualify for food rations. \"We're poor, and we rely on government food rations \u2014 seven of them, one for each member of our family,\" Nessa says. \"I'm worried we'll lose them.\" Shah said the NRC should be extended to all of India and suggested that all Indians should have to prove their origin \u2014 and if they can't, they should be deported, though it's unclear where exactly they would go. In Bangladesh, officials have called India's NRC a \"local internal matter\" with \"ethnic undertones\" and have denied that any Bangladeshi citizens are in Assam illegally. Detention camps For Nessa, citizenship is about survival. \"We're poor, and we rely on government food rations \u2014 seven of them, one for each member of our family,\" Nessa says, washing dishes at an outdoor pump next to her home, between rice paddies. \"I'm worried we'll lose them. We rely on this assistance.\" She worries that her husband and children, including her pregnant daughter, could be detained \u2014 even deported. But to where? Nessa says they all have Indian birth certificates. \"Many people have proper documents. Still, they have been declared foreigners and thrown into detention camps,\" says Akram Hussain, a Muslim community activist who visits detainees in Assam centers and helps them file appeals to reinstate their citizenship. Demonstrators clash with police while protesting against the Citizenship Amendment Bill during a visit by Prime Minister Narendra Modi to Assam in February. The bill seeks to grant Indian citizenship to minorities fleeing religious persecution in predominantly Muslim Bangladesh, Pakistan and Afghanistan.\n                \n                    \n                    Biju Boro/AFP/Getty Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption Demonstrators clash with police while protesting against the Citizenship Amendment Bill during a visit by Prime Minister Narendra Modi to Assam in February. The bill seeks to grant Indian citizenship to minorities fleeing religious persecution in predominantly Muslim Bangladesh, Pakistan and Afghanistan. Several hundred people are being held in at least six detention camps across Assam. The state has set up tribunals and detention centers, much as the U.S. has done along the U.S.-Mexico border. India's ruling party says Islamist terrorists are trying to infiltrate the country's borders. Hussain says up to a third of residents in the Kamrup region of Assam have been left off the government's draft citizenship list \u2014 including his own 12-year-old daughter. Because the NRC list is preliminary, people left off it face no immediate repercussions. They can still appeal their status. They are able to vote in the current parliamentary elections, provided they are already registered (though a separate and parallel process in Assam has been striking alleged foreigners from voter rolls there). But at some as-yet-undetermined date, if their appeals are turned down and the list becomes official, they would be stripped of all rights conferred by Indian nationality. Many of them may be rendered stateless or forced to apply for citizenship elsewhere. Officials acknowledge there may be errors in the draft list, and they do allow time for appeals. Nessa's family members are appealing their citizenship status. The process requires people to wait in long lines at government offices and submit more paperwork \u2014 in duplicate and triplicate \u2014 in support of their cases. It can be daunting, especially for those who are poor and illiterate. \"Like a mini-India\" All of this is happening in a corner of India that has long been celebrated for its ethnic and religious diversity. \"Assam is like a mini-India,\" says the state's former chief minister, Prafulla Kumar Mahanta. He's a veteran politician and founder of a center-right regional party called Asom Gana Parishad, which lost to the BJP in 2016 state elections. More than one in three people in Assam is Muslim. The state has a Hindu majority. The neighboring states of Nagaland, Mizoram and Meghalaya are overwhelmingly Christian. The region is also home to Buddhists, Sikhs and indigenous tribal people. But Assam's diversity may pose a challenge to Modi's vision for a distinctly Hindu India. In Guwahati, Assam, in May 2018, indigenous women protest the Indian government's move to provide citizenship to minorities from Bangladesh, Pakistan and Afghanistan.\n                \n                    \n                    Anupam Nath/AP\n                    \n                \nhide caption In Guwahati, Assam, in May 2018, indigenous women protest the Indian government's move to provide citizenship to minorities from Bangladesh, Pakistan and Afghanistan. Religion and citizenship During a February visit to Assam, Modi talked about \"Mother India\" being a homeland for Hindus everywhere. To that end, his government has introduced a Citizenship Amendment Bill to grant Indian nationality to anyone who is persecuted in a nearby country \u2014 except if they're Muslim. The bill is aimed at religious minorities \u2014 Hindus, Sikhs, Buddhists, Jains, Parsis and Christians \u2014 in Pakistan, Afghanistan and Bangladesh. (The citizenship offer does not apply to hundreds of thousands of Rohingya refugees in Bangladesh, who are Muslim.) During the February visit, at a rally, Modi explained his reasoning: When India gained independence from Britain in 1947, it was partitioned into Muslim Pakistan (and later, Bangladesh) and secular India. Muslims already have homelands, his logic goes, but other faiths need India to make room for them. But to many in India's northeast, it looks as if Muslims who were born there and have lived there for years are losing their citizenship through the NRC \u2014 even as the government wants to grant citizenship, via the CAB, to non-Muslims who may have never set foot in India. \"The state wants to roll out the red carpet to people based on religion \u2014 Hindus from Bangladesh. But it has a problem with Muslims who have lived here for 400 years,\" says Aman Wadud, a human rights lawyer in Assam. The CAB passed the lower house of India's Parliament in January and awaits final approval by the upper house after the current national election. Modi is running for a second five-year term, and nearly six weeks of voting will end on May 19. Meanwhile, demonstrations have erupted across northeast India. Some call for protection of the rights of local Muslims. But the vast majority have been anti-immigrant rallies. If minorities from neighboring countries are suddenly granted Indian citizenship under the CAB, it is India's northeast \u2014 which borders five countries \u2014 that would likely absorb them. Residents are worried that newcomers could drain public coffers. Experts say both of these BJP policies disadvantage Indian Muslims. The NRC would reduce their numbers in real terms by stripping them of citizenship. The CAB would reduce their percentage of India's population by adding non-Muslims to the country. \"I think this is quite telling about who they see as ultimately finding a place in this kind of new, proudly Hindu India,\" says Milan Vaishnav, director of the South Asia Program at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace in Washington, D.C. Secular India Critics also suggest that the Citizenship Amendment Bill may violate India's constitution because it would use religion as a criterion for Indian citizenship for the first time. Articles 14 and 15 of the constitution establish \"equality before the law\" and prohibit the state from discriminating against any citizen on the grounds of religion. \"Religion was never a basis of citizenship. But the BJP is making it so, just to show they're pro-Hindu,\" Wadud says. If India, under Modi, wants to become a Hindu state, experts say there are a few possible scenarios: It could prioritize the rights of its majority Hindus and become a homeland for Hindus worldwide \u2014 just as Israel is a homeland for Jews and Pakistan was created as a homeland for Muslims. Or it could model itself after Turkey, a secular country whose majority faith, Islam, has played a larger role in public life under President Recep Tayyip Erdogan. If reelected with a big majority, Modi's BJP may perceive a mandate to try to alter the constitution and insert religion as a standard for citizenship, says historian Romila Thapar, professor emerita at Jawaharlal Nehru University in New Delhi. But it's more likely, Thapar says, that Modi would seek to change the country in more subtle ways \u2014 which are already being used. \"They can use other agencies in order to bring in virtually a Hindu state: education, jobs, who is to be employed, control over the media, for example,\" Thapar says. \"It is amazing how much the middle class has bought this whole idea of Hindu nationalism without really thinking about it.\" Thapar believes that if Modi is reelected, he'll push forward with a fundamental change to India's character.

Attorney General William Barr has been on the job for just 10 weeks, but in the short time he has led the Justice Department, he has already managed to put his stamp on the place. In the long run, Barr's tenure may be judged by his handling of the special counsel report on Russian election interference \u2014 a performance that a book reviewer at The New York Times recently likened to a \"velvet fog.\" The attorney general picked up the leitmotif used by President Trump all along in the Russia investigation: \"No collusion.\" Democrats in Congress were blunt: They're accusing Barr of misleading people about special counsel Robert Mueller's conclusions and acting as a defense attorney for President Trump, not the top legal officer of the United States. But when Barr testifies Wednesday before the GOP-led Senate Judiciary Committee, Chairman Lindsey Graham of South Carolina is likely to try to help the attorney general turn the page on that story. Graham has signaled he wants Justice Department leaders to investigate the origins of the Russia probe, which Barr recently said involved \"spying\" on the Trump campaign. Rep. Jerry Nadler, chairman of the House Judiciary Committee, will likely give Barr a much frostier welcome when the attorney general appears before that panel on Thursday \u2014 if negotiators can agree upon the terms under which Barr would testify. Sen. Amy Klobuchar, a Democrat from Minnesota who's running for president, told NBC's Meet the Press on Sunday that she thought the attorney general has a great deal of ground to cover with Congress. \"This isn't just about the Mueller report and what's happening with Russia,\" Klobuchar said. \"This is about what's going on with immigration, this is about what's happening with the Affordable Care Act, where millions and millions of Americans \u2014 over 50 percent of them \u2014 are afraid they're going to lose their coverage because of preexisting conditions. [Barr] has to come before the Congress and explain what in the world this administration is doing when it comes to people's everyday lives.\" An examination of Barr's record so far demonstrates where he wants to take the department on some of those other priorities.

Earlier this month, Barr issued an order that could keep thousands of asylum-seekers in detention while they wait for their cases to be heard in immigration courts. Barr exercised his prerogative as attorney general to overturn a 2005 policy that applies to people who argue they face a \"credible fear of torture or persecution\" if they're returned to their country of origin. The move follows other hard-line measures the Trump administration has adopted to try to deter undocumented immigrants from entering the U.S. The Barr Justice Department also recently issued a report on the \"number of aliens in federal, state and local custody\" following a 2017 executive order signed by President Trump. The report said nearly half of the undocumented immigrants in Bureau of Prisons custody committed drug trafficking or drug-related crimes. About 4% committed weapons offenses and 3% were convicted of racketeering or \"continuing criminal enterprise offenses,\" which include murders-for-hire.

In recent weeks, federal prosecutors have announced a number of new cases against medical professionals and corporate executives who allegedly fueled the opioid crisis. First came a sweep that ensnared nearly 60 doctors, pharmacists and others who operated in hard-hit areas in Appalachia. Those cases involve more than 350,000 prescriptions for controlled substances and more than 32 million pills \u2014 the equivalent of a dose of opioids for \"every man, woman and child,\" across Ohio, Kentucky, Tennessee, Alabama and West Virginia. Next, the U.S. attorney in the Southern District of New York charged a drug distribution company and its former chief executive with conspiracy to distribute controlled narcotics for invalid medical reasons and conspiracy to defraud the United States. The former CEO, Laurence Doud III, is fighting the charges. Health care In a rare note of dissension with the White House, Attorney General Barr  disagreed with the president's decision to abandon defending part of the Affordable Care Act, the signature domestic policy of the Obama administration. But even though Barr and White House lawyers privately expressed skepticism about whether the Trump approach would win in court, the attorney general did not publicly contradict the Trump view or threaten to resign in opposition. Health care policy expert Julie Rovner told NPR's Weekend Edition last month that the DOJ approach \"does certainly raise the prospect of a court decision that would say there could be no more protections for people with preexisting conditions. That's one of the most popular parts of the health law.\" Style Attorney General Barr speaks to President Trump before the first veto of his presidency in the Oval Office of the White House on March 15.\n                \n                    \n                    Evan Vucci/AP\n                    \n                \nhide caption Attorney General Barr speaks to President Trump before the first veto of his presidency in the Oval Office of the White House on March 15.

For example, after Barr said there was \"spying\" on the Trump campaign at a congressional hearing this year, Democratic Sen. Brian Schatz of Hawaii offered him the opportunity to rephrase his remarks. Barr shrugged it off. And after criticism built over his four-page letter to lawmakers that contained the \"principal conclusions\" of the special counsel, Barr largely deflected by turning attention on the questions themselves. \"I'm not sure what your basis is for saying I'm being generous to the president,\" Barr told a reporter.",

She has written a new book called How Safe Are We? Homeland Security Since 9/11 by Janet Napolitano and Karen Breslau Hardcover, 215 pages | Your purchase helps support NPR programming. How? When Janet Napolitano took over the Department of Homeland Security in 2009, she inherited a sprawling organization still in its infancy. Less than a decade old, the agency had a staff of more than 200,000 employees \u2014 and they were responsible for some pretty big tasks: securing the nation's borders; responding to natural disasters; fighting terrorism; and managing cybersecurity. Those challenges were tough then. And some are more difficult now. Napolitano, who was governor of Arizona prior to taking the Homeland Security post, outlines some of these challenges in her new book How Safe Are We?: Homeland Security Since 9/11, which she co-wrote with Karen Breslau. Napolitano, who left Homeland Security in 2013 and now heads up the University of California system, talked with NPR's Korva Coleman. Some highlights of the interview follow. So let's start with the elephant in the room: immigration. President Trump has announced that he wants to close large sections of the southern U.S. border. What do you make of this approach? Oh, I think it's unnecessary and unwise. First of all, the economic impact would be huge. Mexico is our number two trading partner. There are thousands of trucks and vehicles that go through those ports of entry day in and day out, responsible for hundreds of thousands of jobs within the United States. So just the plain economic impact of that would be immediate \u2014 and it would be deep. And in terms of immigration and immigration enforcement, that is not the way I would recommend that the president approach the border. I would recommend that the president approach the border as a border zone, that he flood the zone with the rule of law, that he bring on board more immigration judges and more immigration courts, station them right at the border, so that those who are presenting themselves with their applications for asylum can have their their cases adjudicated fairly and expeditiously. This week, the head of Customs and Border Protection said that the matter has reached a breaking point. What does that mean? Well, I think what it means is they are insisting on detaining everyone that they apprehend at the border. And that's simply not necessary. You can give people a return date, if necessary you give them an ankle bracelet, you put them on enhanced monitoring \u2014 all kinds of ways to make sure that they come back for their hearings. And the vast majority of them do. But when you take the position that everybody has to be in detention \u2014 adults, children \u2014 then you quickly strain the system. Journalists reporting from the U.S.-Mexico border, including NPR's own John Burnett, have said that Border Patrol agents are swamped and that border crossings show no signs of slowing down. Is there something to be said for President Trump's hardline approach? Well, he's had this hardline approach since he's been president. And it clearly is not working, if the numbers are any indication. I actually think we should take a step back and analyze \u2014 what is the source of this migration? And the source of it now is families fleeing the conditions in Guatemala, El Salvador and Honduras. We ought to reinvest, as a country, in improving conditions in those countries \u2014 working on gang violence prevention, working on strengthening the institutions of government, the judicial systems, the law enforcement systems. You know, we did something like that with Colombia years ago, when Colombia was essentially a narco state. And the United States said, look that's not acceptable. And there were people in Colombia who didn't want to live in a narco state, and working together and putting some American resources into it \u2014 now Colombia is essentially a tourist destination. We can achieve the same kind of progress in the northern countries of Central America. You write that immigration reform means three things: securing the southern border; designing a visa system that's fair; and then building a functional immigration system. Can you talk about these? Sure. So we need to have a secure southwest border. Every country is entitled to have secure borders and to enforce those borders. But enforcing security at the southwest border does not mean sealing the southwest border with a wall. It means a real strategy. And a wall is a symbol \u2014 it's not a strategy. A strategy is manpower technology like ground sensors, tunnel detection equipment, air cover like drones, and strengthening the actual ports of entry. That's a real border control strategy. Visa and visa reform, I would go in a different direction than this administration \u2014 I would increase the number of visas that we allow for people coming to this country to work, or to be reunified with their families, or for other humanitarian purposes. I think that's consistent with our history, it's consistent with our values. And then, thirdly, we need to find a way where those in the country who are undocumented can get right with the law. I think they need to, perhaps, pay a fine, learn English, demonstrate that they have no serious criminal record. And then, after a period of years, they should be entitled to stay and, ultimately, to become citizens of the United States. So some would criticize that as amnesty \u2014 and something that should not be allowed. How would you respond to them? Well, I don't think it's amnesty. I mean, I think what I've just spelled out is there's a lot that someone would have to go through in order to apply for citizenship and they would have to really want it. And, you know, our country is kind of built on that. It's built on people coming here who want to contribute, to want to build a better life for themselves and for their families. It's part of what makes America great. You've talked about your book as being a type of report card on how secure the nation actually is. And one of the areas you've marked as \"needs improvement\" is our response to foreign cyber incursions \u2014 and not just into, say, states voting systems but into power companies, private companies that hold private records \u2014 such as healthcare and banking data \u2014 and, of course, social media. How can we better protect ourselves against foreign saboteurs? This is such a tough issue. And it is inordinately complex in. In my book, I spell out ten things that I think we should have a sort of a commission, sort of a pre-9/11 commission on cyber take up from clarifying the jurisdictions of the various federal agencies that touch upon cybersecurity, all the way up to and including what constitutes an act of cyber warfare \u2014 and what are the sanctions that attend to that. Part of that, obviously, is working internationally because cyber doesn't respect or know national boundaries, and a lot of it involves working with the private sector because so much of our nation's critical infrastructure is in private sector hands: our banking system; telecommunications; water systems; utility systems, you name it. And plus, we have the big social media platforms, the Facebook and the Twitters \u2014 and everything in between. All of these need to be brought to bear on this very complicated topic. But it is the homeland security issue of of this decade. One of the things you talk about is the damage that could occur from cyber-sabotage \u2014 for example, blackouts when people not only can't get into their banks, but we're also talking about dams, we're talking about people stuck in elevators, we're talking about people being able to call 911 for help. This this could be extremely damaging should something like this occur. That's right. And, you know, one of the points I make in the book is, you know, after the attacks of 9/11 there was a very high-level commission assembled. And it was given the charge to kind of go back and reverse-engineer what happened on 9/11, how that occurred. And when you read the commission report, what they identified were lots of red flags that had been noticed before the attack of 9/11 but that there was a failure of imagination \u2014 a failure of imagining that someone could get on a plane and turn that plane into a weapon and fly it into a building. We have so many red flags in the in the cyber world right now. And what I'm concerned about is that we really could experience a cyber-cause, 9/11-style event where you would have mass shut down \u2014 maybe not just in one community or two communities, but many communities at the same time. We need to get ahead of that now. This needs to be a top priority from a security standpoint. Voting across the country actually takes place at the state level. How can an agency like the Department of Homeland Security guarantee that voting by Americans is safe? I think one of the approaches that could be taken would be to bring together all of the county recorders and secretaries of state, you know, the individuals that have authority over our voting systems and establish national standards that voting systems must adhere to \u2014 and then put some federal dollars to help under-resourced communities be able to reach those standards. And I think there's some real urgency to this. The 2020 election is going to be here before we know it, and we know that 2016 was infiltrated by the Russians. They were all over our 2016 election. We have no confidence that they have stopped that behavior. So what are we doing as a country about that?. You suggest that people need to be willing to trade some of their privacy for security. Who pays that price? That's an interesting question because I think that being part of a country, you you have a relationship to all \u2014 we're not all just total you know iconoclastic individuals. But on the other hand, we don't need to just assume that security and privacy are unalterably in conflict. I think as we conduct security operations as we adopt new security techniques or protocols, that concepts of privacy should be corporate from the get-go. I call it privacy by design. You know the Department of Homeland Security actually has a chief privacy officer. I think it's one of the few cabinet-level agencies that does. And we were involved in some you know really intense debates about whether what we were doing swung the pendulum too far in one way or the other. I've just read this week that the DEA is still gathering bulk data of Americans and is doing so without benefit of court permission. They're using administrative subpoenas. And this was revealed this week by the Justice Department's inspector general. Now I realize DEA is not part of Homeland Security but there is a distrust among Americans that there is going to be an intrusion into one's privacy and that we still don't really know what is being surveilled or who. Well, I think that the question really is: What is the utility of collecting so much data? I think that we need to be thinking about what data is really essential or important for us to have from a security perspective and tailor our operations in that regard. So I think a lot of this bulk data collection, I must say, seems to be data collection for data collection sake. There was a DHS report in 2009 that warned about right-wing extremism from hate groups, especially from white supremacists. But that report was controversial because it discussed the possibility of veterans becoming radicalized by white supremacy groups and people were offended. You withdrew this report. How did that happen, and come to be? It came to be because the report, perhaps, painted with too broad a brush with respect to perhaps leaving the impression that all veterans were targets of being right-wing extremists recruits. And the veterans groups in Washington D.C. got very upset with that characterization and, as a result, I was asked to apologize for the report. I apologized for the report. We withdrew it. It was recast but I think the point now is that I think we all recognize that their report was prescient in terms of predicting the rise of white nationalism, right-wing extremism whatever verbiage you want to call it. And, you know, we've seen this in increasing numbers of events in our country over the past years. Given incidents such as Charlottesville, the mass shooting at the Pittsburgh Tree of Life synagogue, the package bombs last October mail to prominent Democrats. Should Homeland Security revisit the issue of domestic terrorism by white supremacists in a more formal way? I hope it is, and because I think it's an important part of the the mission of the Department of Homeland Security to protect the safety and security of Americans. And I think that this rise in white nationalism, right-wing extremism culminating in mass gun violence is is an ever-increasing risk to our our safety and our security.  You argue in the book that the Trump administration is focusing too much on issues such as the U.S.-Mexico border and not enough on climate change. What needs to be done differently? Two things: Number one, I think the United States should do its part to reduce the rate of global warming and rejoin the Paris Accords and re-adopt the standards in the Paris Accords. Secondly, however, I think we must we must do more by way of adaptation to the climate change that already has occurred. You know: How do we build our roads? Where do we locate our bridges? What kind of building materials can be used? When a community is destroyed by a natural disaster, where is it allowed to be rebuilt? These are the kinds of questions that I think FEMA should be taking on in a climate-adaptation regime.  You discuss having a deep reverence for our country and the concept of public service as a calling. Have have we lost that feeling? I hope we have not. I think that the men and women I was privileged to work with throughout my career from the assistant U.S. attorneys I worked with in Phoenix, to the deputy state attorneys general, to the department heads when I was governor, to all of the men and women in the Department of Homeland Security, these are people who have really decided to contribute their lives for the betterment of the country. And I know it sounds corny and it sounds, perhaps, naive to say, but you know I really believe in this concept of public service and in government service. And that's one of the things I regretted so much during the recent shutdown, as we had so many people still coming to work and not being paid for over a month. That just shouldn't happen.",

            "article_content": "Luis Alberto Urrea's The House of Broken Angels borrows from the story of his older brother, who died of cancer. He told Fresh Air in 2018 that the book went through a rewrite after the 2016 election.  TERRY GROSS, HOST: This is FRESH AIR. I'm Terry Gross. My guest, Luis Alberto Urrea, writes what he describes as a literature of witness. He was born in Tijuana to a Mexican father and American mother. When he was 3, they moved to California. He grew up in a San Diego barrio. He has family on both sides of the border. This dual culture was the subject of his memoir, \"Nobody's Son.\" He's also written about the period he did relief work in Tijuana with the garbage pickers who survive on what they can find in the mountainous garbage dumps. He was nominated for a Pulitzer Prize for his 2004 nonfiction book, \"The Devil's Highway,\" about a group of 26 Mexican men who crossed the border illegally, guided by smugglers through the Arizona desert, where they were abandoned by the smugglers. More than half the men died in the desert. Urrea's latest novel, \"The House Of Broken Angels,\" just came out in paperback. It borrows from the real story of his older brother Juan, who was dying of cancer when his mother died. After her funeral, the family threw a party for Juan that was part birthday celebration, part wake. Urrea is a distinguished professor of writing at the University of Illinois, Chicago. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED BROADCAST) GROSS: Luis Urrea, welcome to FRESH AIR. So did Donald Trump's candidacy and election and build the wall and end DACA influence your decision to write this novel or influence the content of it? LUIS ALBERTO URREA: It definitely affected my rewrite of the novel. You know, the novel started out as a kind of a slim memoir inspired by the events of my brother's death and final birthday party on Earth before his death. And it kind of was what I call the Mexican \"Finnegans Wake,\" right? All these mad people. And I started out writing a slender memoir a little bit, I think, focused like Truman Capote's little memoirs. Do you remember the Thanksgiving Memory (ph) and the \"Christmas Memory?\" But then as I expanded it and it started taking on more of a cultural body, more of a cultural statement and turned into a novel which seemed to want to become epic, I couldn't shake my growing sense of rage and astonishment at the tone and people I loved facing horrible fear with DACA and people I loved and knew being confronted by good Americans spewing demented vitriol at them. GROSS: You know, part of me wants to ask you if you have relatives who are here illegally or have relatives who would be deported if DACA ends. But if you have relatives who are in danger of being deported, why would you want to tell me that in public like this? URREA: I ain't saying they are, and I ain't saying they ain't, (laughter) but... GROSS: Right. URREA: Yes, I do know people intimately who are undocumented. And I know a lot of people in Chicago not related to me who are DREAMers who are in fear. So I would say in the most general terms without pointing fingers at any specific relative, yeah. GROSS: You said that when you were growing up, there was, like, a border wall within your home... URREA: Yeah. GROSS: ...Because of the ethnic divisions. Your mother was born in Staten Island. URREA: Indeed. GROSS: Some of her family is from Virginia. Your father was Mexican, grew up in Mexico and lived there until you were 3. But your father, on the other hand, was white. Blond-haired and blue-eyed? URREA: Yes, yes. GROSS: So I'm not sure what his ethnic background was. But - so describe that wall in your own home. URREA: The situation was kind of complicated in that my mother didn't speak Spanish. My father spoke English, you know, as best he could. And I think that the worry in the family, our little, tiny family, was that one side was struggling with all her might to make me an American boy. And the other side with all of his might was trying to keep me a Mexican boy. And in my mother's world, I wasn't named Luis, I was named Louis. I was Louis Woodward, one of her people. And that kind of combat over me was extended into so many other things - you know, the two cultures clashing, the relationship coming apart at the seams but sort of trapped together by my fervent Catholicism. I was that kid that told them they couldn't get a divorce, even as a little kid - 'cause you're going to go to hell if you get a divorce. You can't. And so jokingly, I tell people when I'm on tour that the kitchen was the United States. The living room was Mexico. In the kitchen, I was Louis. In the living room, I was Luis. And it was obvious to me even then that that weird border that I crossed constantly with my dad was right there in my silly, little apartment. GROSS: You must've been pretty confused when you were growing up if your parents were fighting over your identity. Identity is really hard to form when you're coming of age. You're asking yourself who you are. You try on different masks until you find your real face. URREA: Yeah. GROSS: But if your parents are arguing about who you are and whether you're Mexican or American, how can you figure out who you are? URREA: Good question. I don't know. I mean, you know, I went from living in Tijuana full time to then being in the barrio, which was Tijuana lite, and spending... GROSS: This was in San Diego? URREA: Yeah, San Diego. Spending maybe 30 to 40 percent of my time going back to Tijuana. Spanish was my first language. Honestly, I learned to first speak in Spanish, not English because my poor mother had to go to San Diego every day to work and then come back. And she would come home when I was an infant long after I was asleep. (In Tijuana accent) And so I had a Tijuana accent. I talked like this. It's easy for me to slip back into talking that way. That's how we talked. And my mother was beside herself with the fear that this was happening to her boy, and she combated that with Mark Twain. Gift from God, right? Mark Twain. She would read me \"Tom Sawyer\" in bed. And I thought, this is the coolest thing ever. I couldn't believe it. I didn't know what she was talking about. I had not seen rivers. You know, there's a Tijuana River, but it was basically an effluent overflow. And there's a San Diego River, allegedly, which is kind of - in Colorado, would be a medium mountain stream, but it's not a river. So the Mississippi, aside from being a really strange word, seemed like this science fiction thing to me, a fantasy thing. And Mark Twain, who was this old, white man who's been dead maybe a thousand years - I couldn't quite comprehend - telling these hilarious, exciting, modern-sounding, adventuresome tales about these incredible people. She brought me into American-ness, into English, through story. And I often tell this tale on tour with people. Now that I'm telling you, I won't have to tell it again. But my dad was eager to find a text in Spanish 'cause he saw my mom winning. You know, I, all of a sudden, didn't care for mariachi music. I liked the Beatles, you know? He called them Los Beatles (ph). (LAUGHTER) URREA: And he hated - he was like, what kind of a man wears hair like that, Mijo? She was winning on all those fronts. And my father was combating it with Tijuana television and old Mexican records that I didn't want to listen to. And he was trying to find a Mexican classic, so I would read it in Spanish and preserve that part. And what I love about him is that he scoured Tijuana looking for a bookstore. In those days, even today, Tijuana, not quite the incredible Brooklyn hipster literary town, though it's getting there now. So he couldn't find a bookstore. And somehow he found a book in Spanish for me, and it was from Spain, and it was a translation of Homer - the \"Odyssey.\" GROSS: Wow. URREA: He brought it home. And he slammed it on the table, and he said, Mijo, study this book in its original Spanish. GROSS: (Laughter). URREA: And I - even at that early age - it was probably fourth grade - I knew that he was pretty far off target. But it made me love him so much. GROSS: So in the conflict between your mother wanting you to be American and your father wanting you to be Mexican, did you, at some point, say to yourself, I'm Mexican-American? URREA: (Laughter). I'll be honest with you. So the neighborhood we lived in was full of ethnic violence and strife. And it was a neighborhood where black versus brown versus white and any combination of those, OK? So if you can imagine me, Irish-looking kid, talking Tijuana with a Mexican accent going to Catholic school - right? - walking - this sounds like a great hard-luck story. But, you know, it wasn't quite a mile. But it was a pretty long walk through the barrio in my little, silly Catholic school uniform every day. And can you imagine all the homeboys watching this? And I always have this weird fantasy of them all saying, gentlemen... GROSS: (Laughter). URREA: ...Right? - let us make peace and kick his butt today... GROSS: (Laughter). URREA: ...Which is perhaps what made me a big reader, right? I'd rush home and lock myself in and read. And in fourth grade, a scary event happened, which is melodramatic to talk about. But I escaped some street violence - let's put it that way - and my parents felt that it was time to get out of that ambiance. And my mother had come into a little bit of inheritance money. And we suddenly moved north again. And note the journey - right? - heading north. We went north to a little, essentially, Anglo, working-class suburb - in other words, to my mother's at least ethnic group, not my father's. And we were the first mixed family in our little neighborhood, which caused a lot of interesting things. But I suddenly, for the first time in my life, heard pretty harsh anti-Mexican rhetoric. And I myself was called greaser, wetback, taco bender - which was a San Diego specialty. I thought that was a good insult because it was creative - you know, a little bend in the taco. You're so witty. GROSS: (Laughter). URREA: And I had gone - I had joined the Boy Scouts. I was instantly an American kid, and I liked it. I thought, OK, Americans have lawns. That's cool. I had not seen lawns until fifth grade - big green lawns. And they have the Boy Scouts. And my father didn't like the Boy Scouts, and I couldn't figure out why. Now, talking to you, it suddenly makes a little more sense that it was, in his eyes, a capitulation - right? - to more American-ness, though he struggled hard. He memorized the dictionary, five pages a week, to learn English. But he didn't like the trappings, I don't think. And I remember him telling me, Mijo, if you want to be a man, join the Army. And I said, Dad, I'm in fifth grade. How can I... GROSS: (Laughter). URREA: But that was the moment when people started calling me greaser, and I didn't know what to make of it. I found my Mexican accent - it wasn't a conscious choice. It just vanished. I started speaking like my mother. GROSS: And you describe yourself as looking Irish? URREA: Kind of, yeah. GROSS: Pale skin? URREA: Oh, yeah. Yeah, yeah. My dad - you know, he looked like Errol Flynn. His mom, my grandmother, is from a little town in Sinaloa. But her name was Guadalupe Murray (ph). (LAUGHTER) URREA: And she was, you know, red-haired, blue-eyed, half-Irish lass. And my grandfather, Urrea, is Basque. We're Basques. And the name Urrea in the Basque language means golden man. So it was kind of some weird, you know, genetic experiment where two semi-blonde Mexicans got together and launched this strange tribe. GROSS: Why don't we take a short break here? And then we'll talk some more. If you're just joining us, my guest is novelist and journalist and poet Luis Urrea. His new novel is called \"The House Of Broken Angels.\" We'll be right back. This is FRESH AIR. (SOUNDBITE OF JOHN COLTRANE'S \"OUT OF THIS WORLD\" GROSS: This is FRESH AIR. And if you're just joining us, my guest is writer Luis Urrea. His new book is a novel called \"The House Of Broken Angels.\" Your new novel is inspired in part by your older brother. You shared a father with him but had different mothers. Was his mother Mexican? URREA: Oh, yes. GROSS: So he grew up culturally different than you did with your American mother. URREA: Absolutely. He was 110 percent a Mexican man. GROSS: But he grew up in the States. URREA: No. GROSS: Oh, no, he grew up in Tijuana? URREA: He grew up down in Mexico - yeah, Mexico City. GROSS: So in the novel - well, in real life... URREA: Yes. GROSS: ...Your brother was dying of cancer when his mother died... URREA: Right. GROSS: ...In 2016? URREA: Yeah, 2016. GROSS: And then the day after her funeral, he had a party that was part birthday party and part wake because he was dying. And he knew he was dying, and everybody knew he was dying. And in fact, he did die a month after that party. URREA: He died a few weeks after. It was almost 10 days after he died. GROSS: And so the novel is kind of centered around the funeral and the birthday-wake and all of the emotional changes within the family as a result of those two events. Would you describe what the real party was like when your brother was dying right after your mother died - or rather, his mother died, I should say. URREA: It was the most remarkable thing I'd seen. And I spent the day laughing and then weeping. It was whiplash all day long. So you know, as described in the book with the character Big Angel, my brother was greatly physically reduced. He was in a lot of physical pain. He couldn't stand very well by himself anymore. He spent a lot of time in his bed. But he would come forth to this insane gathering of every kind of person all at once - all the stories going at once, all of the romantic and erotic hookups, all of the feuds, all of the jokes, all of the weeping, all of the strangers sitting in corners kind of baffled about what was going on, a DJ playing weird mashup music that people were dancing to - all happening at once and my brother. And I think that the book came out of two moments - one of them directly quoted in the novel - when I told him, watching people kiss his hand, you're like Don Corleone. And he said, I am Don Corleone - and the other, his having to go to bed and asking me to lie in bed with him at several junctures of the day. GROSS: The brothers in the book talk very intimately when they're lying side by side. URREA: Yes. GROSS: You describe the process of dying. And I want you to read a paragraph from \"The House Of Broken Angels\" in which Big Angel, the character who's dying, the brother who's dying, is actively dying. URREA: (Reading) Big Angel was aware of the sad steps of the dance. It cost him great effort to speak now. When you died, you died in small doses. You had trouble speaking. You forgot who was beside you. You were suddenly furious and in a panic of outrage. You wished you could be saintly. You wished you weren't so weak. You suddenly felt better and fooled yourself into believing that a miracle was about to happen. Well, wasn't that a dirty, rotten thing to pull on somebody? GROSS: So you've witnessed people dying who you loved. Your mother died. Your brother died. You are, fortunately, alive. What was it like for you to imagine the process of dying from the point of view of the person who is dying? URREA: Perhaps poetic license, though we spent a lot of time talking about mortality and how it felt. GROSS: You and your brother? URREA: My brother, yeah. But I had experienced a whole lot of death, you know? Our father died horribly in the hands of Mexican cops. And, you know, I actually had to buy his corpse from them. So I've spent a lot of time pondering it. I worked with a missionary crew, and part of our job was people being ill and dying in Mexico. So yeah, it's been greatly on my mind. GROSS: Was the way he died consistent with who he was? He wanted to maintain his virility. How - did that affect how he handled his own death? URREA: He went out as heroically as he could. I think he was a man of great vigor and a man with a very strong sense of his self. And I think that he orchestrated the exit. He wanted to be magnificent. He wanted to leave behind a kind of a guide for everyone because he took the patriarch role very seriously. And I think he fought to do that till the very end. You know, he orchestrated gestures to be delivered to the family from anonymous sources for a year after he was dead. GROSS: Wow. Like what? URREA: He planned out these timed things. GROSS: What kind of things? URREA: On the anniversary, he had white flowers delivered to his widow with a handwritten letter from him, as though he had sent something from heaven. And, of course, being Mexicans, everybody said, oh, my God. You know... GROSS: (Laughter). URREA: ...Juan wrote a letter from heaven (laughter) - little things like that. And the tradition has carried on. And now in the family, of course, everybody says, wow, Juan's helped Luis write this book. It's really cool. GROSS: He kind of did (laughter). URREA: Oh, yeah, he did. I owe it to him. GROSS: My guest is Luis Alberto Urrea. His new novel, \"The House Of Broken Angels,\" just came out in paperback. After a break, he'll tell us about his father's mysterious death in Mexico and how he had to buy the corpse from Mexican police. And our TV critic, David Bianculli, will review the new reboot of \"The Twilight Zone\" featuring Jordan Peele in the Rod Serling role, introducing each episode. I'm Terry Gross, and this is FRESH AIR. (SOUNDBITE OF SERGIO AND ODAIR ASSAD'S \"SAGA DOS MIGRANTES: RETIRANTES\") GROSS: This is FRESH AIR. I'm Terry Gross, back with Luis Alberto Urrea. Much of his fiction and nonfiction relates to his life as a Mexican-American. His father was from Mexico, his mother from America. Urrea was born in Tijuana. At the age of 3, his family moved across the border to California. His new novel, \"The House Of Broken Angels,\" just came out in paperback. It's about a family with relatives on both sides of the border dealing with a death in the family members. His nonfiction books include \"The Devil's Highway,\" about a group of 26 Mexicans crossing the border illegally. Fourteen of them died in the desert while making the trip. Urrea also wrote a memoir called \"Nobody's Son.\" When we left off, we were talking about his family. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED BROADCAST) GROSS: So you mentioned your father was killed by cops in Mexico. What happened? URREA: Yeah. Oh, gosh. Well, I was the first to go to college. And again, you know, my siblings are all half-siblings. I was the only one - only child in our family. And my father wanted to celebrate it somehow, even though he and my mom were long separated by that point. And so he drove alone down to his hometown in Sinaloa - it was about a 30-hour drive - to retrieve money because he, like so many immigrants, was sending remittance money home. In his dreams, he would return home one day and live in a nice, little house in Sinaloa. And he retrieved $1,000 from the bank - U.S. bills - 20s. And then he drove back. And he was trying to get home, and he'd driven back about - not quite 30 hours. And he got to a town south of Yuma, Ariz., and ran afoul of the police. It's very nebulous what exactly happened with them. But he ended up extremely hurt physically. And they took a lot of his belongings. They took everything, took his shoes, his luggage, all of his belongings. And the injuries to his abdomen particularly made him wet himself. And they never reached into his pocket, so they didn't find the money. And the doctor who came did find it because he was wearing rubber gloves. And he knew if he said anything that they would take it, so he hid it. And essentially, my father waited eight hours in this state, naked on a table, waiting for an ambulance to take him to the American border so he could be saved. And the calculation, I believe, was that he would die. And he did. So the doctor passed that money to relatives, who passed it on down the border to me. I was waiting in the funeral home in Tijuana. And the police brought the body and made me buy it. And they said if I didn't purchase my father, they would keep him. So I spent that money to buy him. GROSS: What incredible corruption and heartlessness. URREA: It was stunning. It truly was. I - you know, I was a kid. I was a senior in college. I had no way to comprehend what was happening, really. And, you know, we had to bury him in an unmarked grave in Tijuana because that was it. That was all anybody had. And later, when the death certificate came, which we had requested because we thought we could - my mom and me - at least get insurance money to help us survive, they said he died in a clinic of a stroke. And when I started trying to investigate, the chief of police of that town called me and said, well, we wish we could help you, but the entire police department has retired this year. They're all gone. So nobody knows what happened. And I wrote him an angry letter. And he wrote me back, and he said, it is better for you and everyone you know that there was no accident. And the punchline to this awful joke is that then he sent me a bill for damages he had caused in what we suspect was a police chase of his car where they rammed the car and forced him off the road. GROSS: They billed you for damages they said your father caused. URREA: Yeah. Yeah. While dying in a hospital bed. And the piece I wrote about it - I wrote in my first book, he must have fallen out of the bed really hard. GROSS: You know, you've written that your father was a superstar in Mexico but never found his footing in the U.S. What made him a superstar in Mexico? URREA: He was on the presidential staff under several presidents in Mexico. He was - the president of Mexico - his license plate number was MEXICO1. He gave my father MEXICO2 (laughter). GROSS: Wow. URREA: Yeah. He met movie stars. You know, he traveled all over. He flew on the presidential plane. He represented the president. At one point, they were on a trip into Texas. And the president of Mexico was denied service in a restaurant. My father was told, you may eat here. You're a white man. He's got to go. And my dad said, he's the president of Mexico. And the restaurant person said, I don't care who he is. And so my father's one unbreakable rule was, you may never go to Texas (laughter), which I do every chance I get. But yeah. GROSS: And when your father moved to the U.S., he had jobs like driving a bakery truck. URREA: Yeah, he... GROSS: Must have been so frustrating for him to have been so highly appointed in Mexico and come here - not that there's anything wrong with driving a bakery truck. But it's certainly not the life he was used to. URREA: No, it was not. And yeah, bakery trucks - it's great when Dad comes home from work (laughter) because he drives the truck home, and then you get a donut. But my dad - you know, the Mexican government is complicated. And as - what he would say to me is that he had been asked to do something he refused to do. And when that happened, they turned against him. GROSS: What did - what was he asked to do? URREA: Kill somebody. And he didn't want to. GROSS: Like, assassinate somebody? URREA: I don't know. Kill somebody. And he used to tell me, I was paid $2,000 to do it, and I never cashed the check. And I thought, you know, it was one of those tall tales until he died. And I went through all his paperworks. And I found the check. I have the check. He never cashed it, never endorsed it - 2,000 U.S. dollars, which, you know, in 1950, maybe, '51 - that was a lot of money. So yeah, that was the story. And he came to Tijuana to join his mom and dad and - which is how all of this - me happened later because he was fleeing Mexico City. And I believe he got a green card to get away from them because those - the government sent people to find him. He was really in trouble. And his first job in the U.S. was as a busboy. And then he worked at a tuna cannery. And then he became the Helms Bakery truck driver, which was like an ice cream man with bread and doughnuts. And then he found bowling alleys. So my whole life, really, after the Helms Bakery life, was hanging out in the back of bowling alleys with my dad. GROSS: Why don't we take a short break here, and then we'll talk some more? If you're just joining us, my guest is novelist and journalist and poet Luis Urrea. His new novel is called \"The House Of Broken Angels.\" We'll be right back. This is FRESH AIR. (SOUNDBITE OF PAQUITO D'RIVERA'S \"CONTRADANZA\") GROSS: This is FRESH AIR, and if you're just joining us, my guest is writer Luis Urrea. And his new book is a novel called \"The House Of Broken Angels.\" Both of your parents sound kind of remarkable. Your mother worked with the Red Cross during World War II. URREA: Yes, she did. GROSS: Well, let's just talk about her a little bit. I mean, what did she do with the Red Cross? URREA: Well, she wasn't a nurse. They had a program called The Clubmobile program, instituted by Eisenhower following the model of the Englishman. And the Clubmobile ladies were known in the vernacular among the GIs as Donut Dollies. They didn't like that term, but that's what has stuck. And we don't know much about them anymore. The Donut Dollies drove 2 1/2 ton trucks with a kitchen mounted on the back. And they went into combat and made coffee and doughnuts for the troops. And there were three women per truck, and they were essentially sent out there as big sisters to these younger guys. They were - had to be 27 years old, had to have some education, had to go through some pretty harrowing training, had to learn to drive these giant trucks. And they had to learn how to make doughnuts. And they would drive into - usually in the rear but nearby so that troops who are having trouble and exhausted and terrified could come and find a little bit of home. They had to dress well. They had a beautifully tailored uniform. They had a government-issued lipstick that had to be a certain shade. And they would offer conversation. And they would carry mail. And they would distribute chewing gum, as well. And they would keep these registers full of the names of all the GIs in that area, so men could look up where their best friends were by region. And also, the trucks had record players. So they carried Benny Goodman records and that kind of stuff and they could play the hits for these GIs. So it was hope. GROSS: You wrote about your mother a little bit in your memoir \"Nobody's Son.\" And, you know, you write about how she experienced, you know, like bomb blasts... URREA: Yes. GROSS: ...That could have killed her. URREA: Yes. GROSS: She was, you know, basically on the battlefield. URREA: She was. She was in the Battle of the Bulge. GROSS: Whoa. URREA: She was trapped in the Siege of Bastogne. And she and her two truck mates were given a government citation for being the women most forward in combat in World War II. They were trapped right in the middle, and then they went and helped liberate Buchenwald. GROSS: Something else that you've done I want to ask you about - you wrote a book that was published in 2004 called \"The Devil's Highway.\" URREA: Oh. GROSS: And this is the story of a group of 26 Mexicans who, in May of 2001, tried to cross the border into America through the desert with smugglers, you know, who were guiding them. And then the smugglers abandoned them in the desert. And they woke up one day. And they were just lost in the desert. So 12 of the 26 survive. Fourteen of them, I guess, died of, like - from the sun and the thirst. URREA: Yes. GROSS: So you write about that and also write about the larger issue of the people who try to cross the border illegally through the desert. And you write about the Border Patrol guards and the trucks. And one of the things you write is your missionary background made you deeply sympathetic to the undocumented. Your Mexican-American background made you feel antagonistic toward the Border Patrol. But then you met Border Patrol agents. And, you know, you describe them as disrespected and demeaned by the right and the left. URREA: Yeah. GROSS: What was it like to meet them and try to kind of see the world from their point of view? URREA: I can laugh about it now. (Laughter) In the midst of their giving me a really rough time out at Wellton Station, their supervisory agent came out from the back room. And he saw it. And he asked, what is going on out here? And they're like, this guy's writing a book about the Yuma 14. And they were all scoffing. And he looked at me, and it was one of those weird moments that I call grace, for lack of another word. But he just looked at me with some compassion. And he said, you know, I was in charge of the station that day. And he said, I sent out the rescue run to go get those guys. And that - I don't know - there was a connection. And he said, come with me, man. And he took me in the back. And from that point on, he undertook a bit of training for me. He took me into the field. He showed me how to track. He - so on. And once I had his blessing, the other agents dropped their guard. And when they did, it was a revelation to me that I actually felt a lot of honest human feelings for them. And they told me things. They were aware that I could hurt them. I could damage their careers. I could say anything I wanted to. But more than one agent pulled me aside and said, I don't care if you hate me, but tell the truth. We'll be watching. Tell the truth about us because everybody lies about us. And I thought, OK. GROSS: So I want to read the dedication that you wrote in your book \"The Devil's Highway,\" which was about the group of 26 Mexicans who crossed into America illegally through the desert, were abandoned by the smugglers guiding them. Twelve of them survived, but 14 perished in the desert. So in that dedication, you write (reading) for the dead and for those who rescue the living. That's a beautiful dedication. URREA: Thank you, yeah. You know, how could I hate those agents I went in hating when I realized what they go through? And, you know, they don't talk about it. They won't tell you what they go through. But their families do. And, you know, that was remarkable. And this supervisory agent, at one point, said to me - I didn't put it in the book because I was trying to leave my own experiences out as much as possible. That seemed kind of sinful, you know, to say, wow, I had this wild experience because people died. But, you know, he said to me, you try walking across the desert carrying a dead 19-year-old woman in your arms and tell me I don't have feelings. And, you know, that was haunting. And, you know, when the book came out, the - because the Border Patrol has different groups. They're the agents themselves, but they have a secretive group called BORTAC that they will not talk about. And BORTAC are the tactical guys, the SWAT team. But then they have another group called BORSTAR, and BORSTAR are the actual agents who are lifesavers. And they're the ones taken out into the dead zones and dropped from helicopters. And sometimes, they lower little ATVs out of the helicopters, and these maniacs take off to find who's dying. You don't hear about them, but when the book came out, a couple of those guys actually mailed me the shirts they were wearing when they did the rescues in my book. GROSS: When you meet people who really believe that we should build a wall between Mexico and the U.S., what do you tell them? I mean, what do you think about this moment in the life of our country where the president is insisting that he's going to build that wall? URREA: It's - you know, I try to be respectful. And one of the points for me is to listen to people and hear them because I think, sometimes, people get more and more outrageous because they feel insulted or looked down on or - you know, so I'll listen. But sometimes, it's really hard. And I'm telling you this wall is a boondoggle. It's a joke. I'm telling you one day it's going to be a kitschy tourist stop for ironic hipsters. It's going to be spray painted. It's going to look like Cadillac Ranch. And people are going to take selfies at it. But it's not going to start a multibillion-dollar Great Wall of China project. I promise you. There's no way to build it. People in Mexico make jokes about it. They say hilarious things. Somebody told me, you know, it's OK. When they build it, they're going to hire us to build it, you know? And once it's up, then we will run the concessions. We'll take pictures. We'll make tacos. We'll have tours. And then when it's time to take it down, they'll hire us to take it back down. But it won't stop anything. People are like, you know, they invented this thing called airplanes. There's a thing called ships, you know? (LAUGHTER) GROSS: It has been so great to talk with you. Thank you so much, and... URREA: Thank you. GROSS: ...Let's do it again. URREA: Oh, yeah, anytime.

For years, Spain had avoided the rise of far-right populists, dodging a trend sweeping other parts of Europe. But recently, that all changed. In December, the far-right party Vox won 12 seats in the regional parliament of Andalusia, in southern Spain. It is the first time a far-right party has entered mainstream Spanish politics since the end of its decades-long dictatorship in the late 1970s. Vox now shares power in a coalition with two other parties in the country's most populous region. Though still relatively small nationwide, Vox could soon have an impact on the national scene too. Last Friday, Prime Minister Pedro S\u00e1nchez called an early general election for April 28, after his Socialist government failed to pass its 2019 budget plan. That gives Vox a fresh chance at campaigning across the country to win its first seats in Spain's parliament in Madrid. \"Make Spain great again\" Right-wing populist parties are rising, and center-left ones are faltering, in other parts of Europe and beyond. And some aspects of Vox's agenda are reminiscent of the other movements, while others are local. It wants to deport undocumented migrants living in Spain, limit regional autonomy and repeal a domestic violence law that protects women from their abusers. It has received support from French nationalist Marine Le Pen as well as Steve Bannon, President Trump's former strategist. One of Vox's ads even ends with the slogan \"Make Spain great again.\" Spanish nationalism was the official doctrine throughout the dictatorship of Gen. Francisco Franco, a regime that isolated the country and crushed dissent. Since Franco's death in 1975, the country has made huge social, political and economic progress \u2014 and many Spaniards hoped nationalism would become a thing of the past. But in the December elections, Vox won a foothold in Andalusia with a nationalist message. It governs along with more moderate coalition partners, the Citizens Party and the People's Party, putting an end to 36 years of center-left Socialist government in the region. Catalan independence drive Vox formed in 2013, but it is just now gaining popularity at a time when Spain has become a leading European destination for migrants and while many Spaniards are angered by the independence movement in the northeastern region of Catalonia. In October 2017, Catalan lawmakers voted to make Catalonia its own republic after a referendum that Spain's central government called illegal. The regional president called for talks with Madrid, stopping short of formally declaring independence. He later fled to Belgium, where he remains. The way the media have portrayed the Catalan separatists is that they're the bad guys, that they're going to make Catalonia break away from Spain, that the Andalusian people aren't going to receive any more help. Concha P\u00e9rez Curiel, journalism professor at the University of Seville \"The way the media [outside Catalonia] have portrayed the Catalan separatists is that they're the bad guys,\" says Concha P\u00e9rez Curiel, a journalism professor at the University of Seville, \"that they're going to make Catalonia break away from Spain, that the Andalusian people aren't going to receive any more help.\" Some of the taxes collected in Catalonia, a prosperous region, are funneled into regions such as historically poor Andalusia. Many Spaniards say they are tired of the Catalan independence crisis and the mainstream parties' approaches to handling it. \"The Spanish government's lenience towards Catalonia has caused Spaniards to want a political party that puts its foot down,\" says Juan L\u00f3pez, a 48-year-old taxi driver in Seville.

In December elections, support for the far-right Vox party and other conservative politicians went up from the previous ballot in 2015. L\u00f3pez says that is one of the reasons he and other Andalusians sympathize with Vox. \"That explains the results in Andalusia,\" he says. \"None of the other parties were taking a strong stance against Catalonia, but Vox was.\" A new Reconquista Francisco Serrano, Vox's leader in Andalusia, says his party says it like it is and that's what people want. In 2017, shortly after Catalan leaders defied Spanish government orders and pushed for secession, Vox published a video in English comparing the independence movement to Nazi Germany and accusing separatist leaders of \"spreading hate.\" \"What's happening in Catalonia is an attempted coup,\" Serrano tells NPR. \"A sedition, a rebellion, by people who want to break the unity of Spain.\" He says traditional Spanish values are being threatened by illegal immigration, regional nationalism and what he calls \"feminist ideology.\" Serrano's campaign called for a new \"Reconquista\" to take place \u2014 a historical reference to the Christian states' campaign to reclaim territory in the Iberian Peninsula from Muslim rule in the Middle Ages.

Politicians talked about Catalan independence, immigration and feminism, but the region is grappling with a 21 percent unemployment rate, low wages and lack of public housing. \"That constant bombardment of information eventually has an effect on people,\" says Garc\u00eda. \"We're now seeing a political competition between the three right-wing parties,\" he adds, with the largest of the three, the People's Party, which governed the country from 2011 until last June, now shifting further right to recoup votes.

On Feb. 9, just days before S\u00e1nchez called a snap election, tens of thousands of people took to the streets in Spain's capital to demand that the government halt negotiations with Catalan separatist leaders. The leaders of all three parties \u2014 Pablo Casado with the People's Party, Albert Rivera with the Citizens Party and Santiago Abascal with Vox \u2014 spoke side by side and took photos together at the recent protest in Madrid calling for S\u00e1nchez to step down. Several Spanish commentators said it is a sign that Vox is beginning to be accepted by Spain's center-right politicians. Abascal seized the moment to show that his party has a firm message against regional nationalist movements. Speaking in front of protesters waving Spanish flags, he demanded that the \"violent and mafialike\" entities in Catalonia be disbanded. \"Catalonia's autonomy needs to be suspended so that we can reinstate constitutional order and Spain's rule of law,\" he said. A poll at the end of January said Vox could win 6.5 percent of the vote in a national election \u2014 up from just 3.7 percent in December. Together with the Citizens and People's parties \u2014 which polled at 17.7 percent and 14.9 percent, respectively \u2014 Spain's right-wing parties could form a large enough coalition to govern, according to Spanish newspaper El Pa\u00eds. Spain's political climate will continue to be tested in the general election of April 28 and then again during elections for city mayors and the European Parliament at the end of May.",

In his second week in office, far-right Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro has pulled the country out of a U.N. migration pact, fulfilling a pledge he made before taking office. Brazilian diplomats told local media on Tuesday that the country officially left the agreement. A diplomat also told Reuters that Brazil has exited the pact. Bolsonaro appeared to confirm the withdrawal on Wednesday, tweeting, \"No to the compact on migration.\" \"Defense of national sovereignty was one of our campaign's banners and it will be a priority of our government,\" he wrote. \"The Brazilians and immigrants who live here will be safer under rules that we ourselves make, without external pressure.\" Brazil's departure from the Global Compact for Safe, Orderly and Regular Migration marks the latest rejection of the non-binding agreement, which has drawn protest across the world, especially from far-right politicians in Europe. Nearly 30 countries, including the United States, refused to sign the pact in December. Brazil was among the majority of countries that signed onto the compact, under the country's previous administration. Bolsonaro's decision to leave the agreement follows guarantees the president-elect and his foreign minister made last month, after a polarizing election and runoff. \"The Bolsonaro government will withdraw from the Global Compact on Migration being launched in Marrakech, an inadequate instrument for dealing with the problem,\" tweeted Ernesto Ara\u00fajo, now the country's foreign minister, in December. \"Immigration must not be dealt with as a global issue, but rather in accord with each country's reality and sovereignty.\" More than 700,000 registered immigrants live in Brazil, according to the Migration Policy Institute, along with several hundred thousand more undocumented immigrants. By far the largest segment comes from Portugal, followed by Japan, Italy, Paraguay and Bolivia. Meanwhile, Brazil has become one of the primary destinations for an increasing number of Venezuelans fleeing a political and economic crisis at home. At least 65,000 Venezuelans have sought asylum in Brazil over the last four years, according to the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees. Geoff Ramsey, assistant director for Venezuela at the Washington Office on Latin America, told NPR last fall that about a dozen tent camps were operating on the Brazilian-Venezuelan border. Last month, Ara\u00fajo tweeted that Brazil would \"continue to welcome\" Venezuelan asylum-seekers even when it withdrew from the compact, though it would also focus on the \"restoration of democracy in Venezuela.\" The U.N. accord has become a focal point for anti-immigrant sentiment, particularly in Europe. Marine Le Pen, leader of France's far-right National Rally, called the agreement \"a pact with the devil.\" And in Brussels last month, thousands of protesters took to the streets carrying anti-immigration banners as they rallied against the pact. The Trump administration refused to participate in the agreement more than a year ago, while other countries agreed to the pact last summer but pulled out before it was formally adopted, including Austria, Hungary, Italy, Chile and Australia. Bolsonaro's government, now just over a week old, has drawn comparisons to the current U.S. administration, including in its rhetoric on refugees. On Wednesday, the Brazilian president echoed President Trump's language comparing national security to home security. \"If we decide who we let into our own houses, why would we do any differently when it comes to our Brazil?\" he tweeted. In a televised address on Tuesday night, Trump argued for his proposed border wall by pointing out that \"wealthy politicians build walls, fences, and gates around their homes.\" Bolsonaro has taken his victory as a \"mandate\" to change the country's foreign policy, according to an op-ed by his foreign minister published in Bloomberg on Monday. \"We are convinced that Brazil has a much larger role to play in the world than the one we currently attribute to ourselves,\" Ara\u00fajo wrote.",

            "article_content": "Media no longer available Credit:  Video: AP; Photo: Carlos Barria-Pool/Getty Images Updated at 11:27 p.m. ET President Trump made his case to the American people Tuesday night for why a massive wall along the Mexican border is necessary, using his first Oval Office address to outline his conditions for ending the 18-day-and-counting partial government shutdown. \"This is a humanitarian crisis \u2014 a crisis of the heart and a crisis of the soul,\" Trump said, explaining why his request for $5.7 billion to build the wall and for additional border security measures is necessary. \"The federal government remains shut down for one reason and one reason only: because Democrats will not fund border security. ... The only solution is for Democrats to pass a spending bill that defends our borders and reopens the government,\" the president said. Trump's address Tuesday night seemed, at least in part, a way to reassure nervous Republicans about the political cost of the shutdown, some of whom may be wavering as more impacts from the partial closure of the government ripple across the country. Trump and Vice President Pence will meet with Senate Republicans on Wednesday, and on Thursday Trump will visit the border to continue his media blitz. But in the nearly three-week-long shutdown, there still is no clear path to a resolution anytime soon, as both Trump and Democratic congressional leaders in their rebuttal offered nothing new beyond the arguments they've been making since last month. Unlike at his campaign rallies, Trump didn't begin his Oval Office address with his push for a wall. Instead, he first outlined what he says is an urgent need to address a growing number of migrants trying to cross the border and to address drugs coming across illegally. \"Last month, 20,000 migrant children were illegally brought into the United States \u2014 a dramatic increase. These children are used as human pawns by vicious coyotes and ruthless gangs. One in three women are sexually assaulted on the dangerous trek up through Mexico. Women and children are the biggest victims, by far, of our broken system,\" Trump said. Trump also claimed that the \"Southern border is a pipeline for vast quantities of illegal drugs\" and that it was necessary to \"stop the criminal gangs, drug smugglers and human traffickers.\" However, an NPR fact check found that according to the Drug Enforcement Administration, most illegal drugs come through legal ports of entry and only a small fraction comes through parts of the Southern border that would be impacted by a wall. Trump also tried to make an emotional plea, pointing as he often has to crimes and slayings committed by undocumented immigrants as another reason stricter border security is necessary. \"How much more American blood must we shed before Congress does its job? To those who refuse to compromise in the name of border security, I would ask: Imagine if it was your child, your husband, or your wife whose life was so cruelly shattered and totally broken?\" Trump asked, framing his argument as \"a choice between right and wrong, justice and injustice.\" However, studies show undocumented immigrants in the U.S. commit crimes at a lower rate than native-born Americans. The Trump administration has tried to establish a link between terrorism and the situation at the Southern border, and on Tuesday night Trump said a \"barrier is absolutely critical to national security.\" But he and his allies have often exaggerated the threat or simply used inaccurate or misleading statistics to do so. While there has been a spike in Southern border crossings in the past few months \u2014 largely children and families fleeing violence in Central America \u2014 overall illegal crossings are lower than in either 2016 or 2014 and far lower than their peak around 2000. Trump also tried to make the argument that the wall would be paid for, indirectly, by Mexico thanks to a new trade deal he has negotiated to replace NAFTA. However, that new deal has not been ratified by Congress, and as NPR's Tamara Keith has reported, there's no guarantee the economic gains could pay for the wall and the White House has not explained its math to back up that claim. White House press secretary Sarah Sanders also claimed last week that Customs and Border Protection picked up almost 4,000 suspected terrorists along the Southern border, but NBC News found those stops have largely been made at airports. During the first half of fiscal year 2018, CBP stopped just six immigrants at ports of entry on the Southern border who were on a federal terrorist watchlist, NBC also found. Trump asked for more funding for \"cutting age technology,\" more Border Patrol agents (who are currently working but not being paid since the Department of Homeland Security is subject to the partial shutdown) and for more immigration judges. The president also claimed that \"at the request of Democrats\" any wall would be a steel barrier. However, that has not been a condition from Democrats. Rather, after long pushing for a concrete wall, Trump recently shifted to talking about using steel slats to build a barrier on the Southern border, hoping that might convince some Democrats, but it has not. Democrats have remained in staunch opposition to any contingencies on reopening the government, arguing their victories in the midterm elections and public polling have shown the country doesn't want a wall. In their response following Trump's address, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., accused Trump of trying to \"manufacture a crisis, stoke fear and divert attention from the turmoil in his administration.\" \"The fact is: President Trump has chosen to hold hostage critical services for the health, safety and well-being of the American people and withhold the paychecks of 800,000 innocent workers across the nation \u2014 many of them veterans,\" Pelosi said. \"He promised to keep government shut down for 'months or years' \u2014 no matter whom it hurts. That's just plain wrong.\" Pelosi also pushed back on Trump's claims, saying that \"the women and children at the border are not a security threat, they are a humanitarian challenge \u2014 a challenge that President Trump's own cruel and counterproductive policies have only deepened.\" Media no longer available Credit:  Video: AP; Photo: Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images Trump has said he won't sign any bill to reopen the government, about a quarter of which was shuttered on Dec. 22, unless Congress acquiesces to his request for $5.7 billion to build the wall \u2014 Trump's central campaign promise that received raucous applause at his rallies, albeit with the caveat that Mexico would pay for the barrier. Last month, Trump said he would be \"proud\" to shut down the government over border security and would gladly \"take the mantle.\" However, since the partial shutdown became a reality, he has tried to shift the blame to Democrats. Tuesday night Schumer challenged Trump to reopen the government while continuing to negotiate on border security. \"We can reopen the government and continue to work through disagreements about policy,\" the Senate minority leader said. \"We can secure our border without an expensive, ineffective wall. And we can welcome legal immigrants and refugees without compromising safety and security.\" Last week, House Democrats passed legislation to reopen the government, though Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., has said the Senate won't take it up \u2014 even though the Senate passed identical legislation last month before Trump reasserted his desire for billions in funding for a border wall. In a statement after the address, McConnell remained firmly behind Trump and sought to foist blame back on Democrats. \"The past eighteen days have shown that Democrats' refusal to negotiate is not due to any principled objection, but simply due to partisan spite for the president,\" the Senate majority leader said. \"For the men and women of the Border Patrol, for the safety of American families, and for all Americans who deserve a fully operational federal government, I sincerely hope my Democratic colleagues will come to the table and help deliver a solution.\"",

Kamala Harris is expected to launch her presidential campaign in the coming weeks. If a great book is a sumptuous meal, the campaign book is a bottle of Soylent. A novel by Nabokov, a play by Shakespeare, even a pulpy airport crime novel \u2014 these satisfy the basic urge to read a story with beginning, middle and end; to watch characters interact and to understand their complex motivations. These stories are there for the joy of consumption. The campaign book is not that. The campaign book is a delivery device. It's there to supply you with something: the case for Candidate X. If you laugh or cry at Candidate X's book \u2014 well, that's great, but did you come away thinking X would be a good president? That is what matters. Well, that and how much buzz the book creates. Aside from convincing readers, the campaign book is also straight-up marketing, it's there to give a candidate a temporary news cycle boost, as reviewers end up essentially writing Candidate X profiles, almost exclusively sourced from Candidate X's own words. So. It is therefore with a near-crippling dose of self-awareness that I review Kamala Harris' new book, The Truths We Hold. The book, not coincidentally, comes as Harris is expected to launch her presidential campaign in the coming weeks. Harris spoke to NPR about the book Tuesday. As with many campaign books, The Truths We Hold reads as a memoir-but-not-really. Harris does tell her life story, but she uses it as a vehicle for telling us what she really wants us to know about her. Her childhood shows us the values that she received from her mother. The section about her time as a district attorney and then as California's attorney general allows her to tout her accomplishments and lay out her policy positions. Talking about her time in the Senate allows her to further expound upon her positions \u2014 and also to contrast herself with President Trump, whom she presumably hopes to face in a general election. To read a campaign book is to be on your guard, because every detail has an ulterior motive. Let your guard slip, and you can get lost in the hard turns from personal anecdote to policy speak. An American Journey by Kamala Harris Hardcover, 319 pages | Your purchase helps support NPR programming. How? In one section, for example, Harris talks about crafts she made as a kid. So you might think (as I did): She's into crocheting! What a fascinating insight into her hobb- gaaaaah. Nope \u2014 she's using this to tell us about the dignity of work. This is just one way the core aspects of a good book arguably work against a campaign book. Similarly, the best protagonists have flaws. They struggle against something. And it's easy to see why a person who might soon launch a presidential campaign might not be excited to publish their struggles. Harris does indeed gloss over hers. Her retelling of failing the bar on the first try, then passing it on the second, happens in the course of three paragraphs. Her \"tough, determined\" Senate runoff opponent, Democratic Rep. Loretta Sanchez, gets less than three sentences. There's also some careful elision of facts. For example, Harris talks about her frustration with immigration policy in 2014, when \"a big push was coming out of DC to expedite the decision-making process so that they could quickly turn undocumented kids and families back.\" Readers who have paid close attention to history might remember that in 2014, the president was Barack Obama. And while in other parts of her book Harris approvingly name-checks Obama \u2014 a popular guy whom she might want to deliver a stump speech or two \u2014 she forgets to name him here. There are plenty of platitudes. She describes where she grew up: \"It was a close-knit neighborhood of working families who were focused on doing a good job, paying the bills, and being there for one another\" \u2014 and no one could blame you if your mind started wandering halfway through that sentence. There's plain old awkward prose, as in her description of the Women's March: \"There were so many people that cellular networks had gone down, yet the energy was electric.\" So is it a great book? No. No, it is not. But that's not a particularly interesting question, as campaign books are rarely great reads. The question is whether it's an effective book. On that count, Harris is more successful. In The Truths We Hold, Harris presents herself as a potentially formidable presidential candidate. Which is to say: She efficiently makes her case, like the prosecutor she is. Harris ticks through her r\u00e9sum\u00e9 and her policy positions. And this is where one of Harris' biggest strengths becomes clear: anticipating critiques and batting them down. For example, Harris has spent much of her career in law enforcement \u2014 a period that she largely uses in the book as a way to show that she is tough and decisive. But she also anticipates that this might be off-putting to some liberal voters who believe the justice system is broken. And so she frames herself as a sort of inside woman: \"When activists came marching and banging on the doors, I wanted to be on the other side to let them in.\" Which is to say: She presents herself as prepared to deflect the barbs that will certainly come her way. And while the prose may not be Pulitzer-worthy, there are regular sentences that sound particularly crafted to elicit roars at a campaign rally (\"The American people have not given up on the American Dream. ... But when you can't sleep at night, how can you dream?\" \"Prescription medicines are not luxury goods. Quite the opposite. We don't want to need them!\"). Readers even may see the birth of a campaign slogan, as Harris tells the story of her first time trying a case in the courtroom: \"When my turn came, I rose from my chair at the prosecutor's desk and stepped up to the podium, saying the words every prosecutor speaks: 'Kamala Harris, for the people.' \" ... a line that practically begs to be read as a political TV ad voice-over. It's that courtroom experience that may inform exactly how Harris approached writing The Truths We Hold. Toward the end of her book, she explains how she advises young lawyers to write their closing arguments: \"Their job was to get up there and show the jury that two plus two plus two plus two leads, categorically, to eight. I'd tell them to break down every element. Explain the logic of their argument. Show the jury how they reached their conclusion.\" Reading this book, one does get a sense of being in a jury box, patiently listening as a lawyer methodically \u2014 if tediously \u2014 lays out a case. Which is to say: It's not quite that the bar is lowered with the campaign book. It's perhaps more accurate to say that the bar is replaced with a series of hoops. In her opening argument for 2020, Harris jumps through them.",

            "article_content": "A number of areas in North Carolina have decided not to work with Immigration and Customs Enforcement. In the following weeks, ICE has carried out a number of raids, arresting hundreds.  MELISSA BLOCK, HOST: Last month, immigration raids in North Carolina swept up more than 200 undocumented immigrants. That comes after sheriffs and a number of big counties in the state ended their cooperation with Immigration and Customs Enforcement. The raids have left immigrant communities scared. Naomi Prioleau of member station WUNC has more. NAOMI PRIOLEAU, BYLINE: Maria Telles-Sosa and her husband live in a three-bedroom trailer with their two daughters and six grandkids. MARIA TELLES-SOSA: (Speaking Spanish). PRIOLEAU: She says, right now, they're just really afraid. Sosa is an undocumented immigrant, and so is her husband, and so are her daughters, and so are their husbands. In early February, Sosa's husband and her two sons-in-law were all arrested at an ICE checkpoint. Their crime was driving without a license. TELLES-SOSA: (Speaking Spanish). PRIOLEAU: She says she and her two daughters were left without their husbands. It was really stressful, she says, and she was afraid her daughters would be picked up, too. These checkpoints are causing fear throughout the undocumented community in North Carolina, estimated at more than 300,000. But Sean Gallagher says ICE has no choice but to increase enforcement. He's the regional director of ICE for Georgia and the Carolinas. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) SEAN GALLAGHER: The uptick that you've seen - again, direct result of some of the dangerous policies that some of our county sheriffs have put into place. And it really forces my officers to go out on the street to conduct more enforcement operations. PRIOLEAU: After the November election, newly elected sheriffs - all Democrats - and four North Carolina counties abruptly ended their cooperation with ICE. They will no longer honor requests from ICE to hold individuals with questionable immigration status after criminal charges have been resolved. Gallagher's statement angered immigrant rights organizations across the state. The American Civil Liberties Union called the raids a, quote, \"retaliatory detention rampage.\" Mayors of seven of North Carolina's major cities published a public letter expressing their opposition, saying, these raids are detrimental to the welcoming, stable, loving communities that we work every day to build. Charlotte Mayor Vi Lyles did not sign the letter. A recent city council meeting blew up over the issue. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) STEPHANIE HAMRICK: This failure to support our most vulnerable neighbors is a moral outrage. PRIOLEAU: That's Stephanie Hamrick. She was one of many residents who was angry that Mayor Lyles stayed silent. Lyles defended herself, saying she didn't sign the letter because she's focusing instead on creating an immigrant community committee. She has said that, quote, \"words are not enough\" when it comes to helping her city's immigrants. But not everyone in North Carolina opposes working with ICE. In rural Alamance County, sheriff Terry Johnson and the Alamance Board of Commissioners recently voted to continue their cooperation with the immigration agency. TERRY JOHNSON: They crossed the border illegally first time. That is not my concern. But when they crossed the border illegally, come in here, deal drugs, kill people, cartel activity - that is my concern. PRIOLEAU: In their latest contract with ICE, the agency will pay the county $135 per inmate per day. The county also agreed to fill at least 30 beds per day for the first month, and after that, 50 beds per day. Johnson says their partnership with ICE is nothing more than following the law and protecting their citizens, but it will help the county earn money that it desperately needs. Amy Galey is the county board chair. AMY GALEY: Alamance County has a historically low property tax rate, and we struggle with funding some of the things that our school system and other county needs are. So this is a way for our sheriff's department to be a little more independent. TELLES-SOSA: (Speaking Spanish). PRIOLEAU: As the discussions about ICE continue, Maria Telles-Sosa hopes to stay in North Carolina. TELLES-SOSA: (Speaking Spanish). PRIOLEAU: She says she can't go back to Mexico and wants to be with her family. For NPR News, I'm Naomi Prioleau in Greensboro, N.C. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) Copyright \u00a9 2019 NPR.

            "article_content": "One of the most sensitive issues in Taiwan right now is accepting protesters from Hong Kong seeking asylum in Taiwan. But Taiwan has no asylum laws, and many argue the island isn't ready.  MARY LOUISE KELLY, HOST: All right. The political unrest in Hong Kong is banging at the gates of Taiwan. Thousands of Hong Kong protesters are seeking asylum there, but Taiwan has no asylum laws, which leaves asylum-seekers in a legal limbo. Taiwanese voters are conflicted about passing such laws. NPR's Beijing correspondent Emily Feng went to Taiwan and has the story. EMILY FENG, BYLINE: In Hong Kong in July, hundreds of anti-government protesters broke into the region's Legislative Council Building. Fearing up to a decade of prison time, dozens soon fled here to Taiwan. LAM WING KEE: (Through interpreter) They were not prepared at all. They're so young. FENG: Lam Wing Kee is a Hong Kong bookseller. He left for Taiwan in April, believing a proposed Hong Kong law that could extradite criminal suspects might affect him. The bill set off the mass anti-government protests still roiling Hong Kong. The bill was shelved, but Lam is not returning to Hong Kong anytime soon. LAM: (Through interpreter) Hong Kong has no rule of law anymore. I can no longer guarantee my personal safety there. FENG: Lam was among five booksellers kidnapped from Hong Kong and spirited into mainland China by Chinese security officers in 2015. He was detained for publishing books on political topics banned in mainland China. Now in Taiwan, Lam's became a bit of a mentor to the newest wave of Hong Kong refugees who declined NPR's interview requests. LAM: (Through interpreter) I help them understand Taiwan and if they have any fears, I will help them analyze these emotions if their fears are overblown. FENG: Setting up a refugee policy to help people like Lam and the young Hong Kong protesters would also mean welcoming more mainland Chinese dissidents who would likely seek asylum in Taiwan. In the early 1990s, there were nearly a dozen cases of them hijacking airplanes to Taiwan seeking refuge. Most were imprisoned or sent back to mainland China. And many Taiwanese are not happy about the prospect of more mainlanders. GUAN JIANREN: (Through interpreter) Mainland Chinese are even lazier than the locals. They come to Taiwan and they are useless. FENG: Guan Jianren is a newspaper commentator and blogger who has written strongly against any asylum policy that accepts mainland Chinese citizens. He sees mainlanders as ill-mannered opportunists. He also fears Chinese communist spies could overwhelm Taiwanese immigration authorities. GUAN: (Through interpreter) They only have to send 1 million more mainland Chinese over and our democratic values would be disrupted. So we need to have strict screening methods towards immigrants and especially political refugees. FENG: These concerns are why several proposals to pass more concrete refugee law have been defeated. Freddy Lim is a death metal rocker who founded the New Power Party, an activist political group. In July, the party unsuccessfully proposed a refugee law. Now it's election season, and the issue is so sensitive, Lim won't firmly commit to supporting a law anymore. Here's how he explains his position. FREDDY LIM: I think it's not the right moment to encourage them to go into exile because it will be like saying that their movement is a failure and ask them to abandon Hong Kong. And I don't think that's fair. FENG: But without an asylum law, the Hong Kong refugees are in limbo. They can't work legally. They're on short-term tourist visas. And many are so young, they haven't even graduated from high school, making them ineligible for student visas. An informal network of churches and NGOs helps them out. And Taiwan's president and foreign ministers say they support allowing Hong Kong protesters to stay longer in Taiwan. Lam Wing Kee, the Hong Kong bookseller, is hopeful more lasting policy change will eventually result. LAM: (Through interpreter) Taiwan cares about human rights. I know they will help the Hong Kong protesters with what they have. FENG: Where there are elections, Lam says, there is democracy and where there is democracy, room for refugees like him.

For as long as Germany has been a unified country, since 1990, the center-left Social Democratic Party has helped govern Brandenburg, a state in the country's east that surrounds Berlin. Tina Fischer, an SPD member of Brandenburg's state parliament, is concerned about how long that will last. On Sept. 1, voters in her town of Zeuthen helped the far-right Alternative for Germany, the AfD, double its share of the vote in Brandenburg from 12.2% to 23.5%, nearly defeating Fischer's party. In the state of Saxony, to Brandenburg's south, the AfD managed to secure 27.5% of the vote, a 17.8% increase over the last election five years ago. The center-left coalition governments in both Brandenburg and Saxony managed to hold onto power by just single percentage points. The two state elections confirmed what political analysts have been warning for years: that the AfD is rapidly gaining popularity among German voters. In 2013, when the party was founded, it didn't have enough votes to sit in Germany's Bundestag or parliament. Six years later, the AfD is now the third-largest party in Germany, winning 94 of the Bundestag's 704 seats in the last federal elections. The rapidly growing party has center-left politicians like Fischer concerned. The SPD's Tina Fischer believes her party should have reacted more quickly to voters' concerns when Germany took in large numbers of migrants in 2015.\n                \n                    \n                    Rob Schmitz/NPR\n                    \n                \nhide caption The SPD's Tina Fischer believes her party should have reacted more quickly to voters' concerns when Germany took in large numbers of migrants in 2015. Fischer, a 48-year old mother of two, believes her party should have reacted more quickly to concerns about a surge of around a million migrants that Germany began taking in four years ago. Instead, Fischer recalls telling voters, \"No, you don't have to be worried, there are not so many foreigners, what are you talking about?\" Around 2% of the migrants who have moved to Germany, fleeing wars and instability in Iraq and Syria \u2014 roughly 28,000 \u2014 chose to settle in the bucolic towns of Brandenburg. Fischer and her party colleagues have learned the hard way that their constituents are still uneasy about these asylum seekers, and the AfD has successfully campaigned on these fears. \"If our children say, 'I'm frightened,' you can't say, 'You don't have any reason to be frightened,'\" says Fischer. \"That's wrong. It would have been much better to say 'OK, we do something.'\" Fischer, sitting in an outdoor cafe, says her city government should have hired more police officers to patrol public squares, trains and buses to help residents feel safer. As she explains what she could have done better, a man on a scooter recognizes Fischer, beeps his horn and screams, \"AfD is good!\" before riding off. Fischer sighs and shakes her head. She says an emboldened AfD has become popular not only through its anti-immigration message, but by how it delivers that message: through Facebook, Twitter and other social media, in a style Fischer calls \"Diktatur der lauten menschen,\" dictatorship of the loud. \"And they are loud and they are noisy and they are in the newspapers and they are on Facebook,\" she says, \"and then you lose your course.\" AfD supporters and politicians cheer results of the state elections in Brandenburg on Sept. 1.\n                \n                    \n                    Gregor Fischer/dpa/picture alliance via Getty I\n                    \n                \nhide caption AfD supporters and politicians cheer results of the state elections in Brandenburg on Sept. 1. She says she's worried that AfD's surge in popularity in Brandenburg will turn away multinational companies \u2014 the region is home to big employers like Rolls-Royce and engine maker MTU, some of whose employees she imagines might be scared of settling down in what she calls \"Nazi-land.\" AfD voter Peter Scheppert objects to the way the party is characterized. \"It's astonishing. I can say that we are not just one class of the population who are very stupid and who have no education,\" he says. \"We are highly educated, we are professors. Our opinions are shared by all classes of society.\" The 65-year-old retiree says his family \u2013 all of whom, he says, voted for AfD \u2013 have a global mindset. His 45-year-old daughter works for Bayer and speaks Mandarin. His son-in-law has lived in Japan and Spain and wants to complete his Ph.D. in England. Scheppert says he and his family voted for the Social Democrats for decades \u2014 but switched to the AfD in this election because they're frustrated with what he calls \"an unchecked flow of asylum seekers\" into Germany. He's also frustrated with the election results. \"The AfD should have had more votes,\" huffs Scheppert. \"Now, unfortunately, the SPD is still ruling.\" At a grocery store across town, Hendrik B\u00f6heme is on a coffee break from his construction job. He believes that the AfD's popularity is surging because the government \"mismanaged\" an influx of refugees. \"There are refugees all over the world who have to be taken care of,\" says B\u00f6heme. \"Real refugees, with families and children, of course they should stay here. But the single men who can rebuild their home countries should go back.\" Other AfD supporters in Zeuthen refused to be interviewed by NPR, accusing it of being part of a lying, fake news establishment that would portray AfD supporters as Nazis. Roman Kuffert, a spokesperson for the AfD in Potsdam, Brandenburg's capital, says such suspicions are rooted in the way German media and rival politicians portray AfD members \u2014 as extremists. \"We have no problem with the press. The press has a problem with us and always tries to blame us,\" says Kuffert. \"It's wrong to assume we are right-wing radicals. We have Jews in the AfD. We have homosexuals in the AfD. We have migrants. I see people who want to build a reasonable Germany. This certainly has nothing to do with the dark Nazi period.\" A few dozen Jews from the former Soviet Union joined the AfD last year, which caused outrage among Germany's Jewish community. Many migrants, especially from Russia, have also joined the AfD. The leader of the AfD in the Bundestag, Alice Weidel, is a lesbian. Kuffert says Germany's political and social elites will continue to get his party wrong until they come to the realization that the AfD represents what he calls \"the country's middle.\" Polling data released this week shows that while the AfD may not represent \"the middle\" nationwide, the party is rapidly gaining in national popularity. A monthly survey by the Institut f\u00fcr Demoskopie Allensbach  shows the AfD achieving its highest popularity score all year among voters throughout Germany, reaching 14% from just 1.5% in August. Political analysts will be closely watching the upcoming state elections in the eastern state of Thuringia on Oct. 27, where the AfD is polling neck-and-neck with centrist and leftist parties.

Canada has seen thousands of migrants entering the country from the U.S., avoiding official entry points and requesting asylum.\n                \n                    \n                    Al Diaz/TNS/Getty Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption The Olympic Stadium in Montreal was temporarily used as a migrant shelter in 2017. Canada has seen thousands of migrants entering the country from the U.S., avoiding official entry points and requesting asylum. Updated on Aug. 13 at 9:30 a.m. ET Sitting relaxed at the kitchen table of her new home in a comfortable Toronto suburb, Kinda Bazerbashi recalls how differently she felt when her family lived in Houston. Originally from Syria, she had lived in the United Arab Emirates, then arrived in the United States with her family on temporary visas and applied for asylum in 2012. Through a series of rejections and appeals, she says, they lived their lives in a legal limbo that made it hard to work, plan or travel to see scattered relatives. \"You are just like in jail, in a nice life,\" she says. \"There are cars. There is supermarket, but you feel, inside, you are in jail.\" By the time President Trump was elected, only a temporary protected status at the discretion of the White House kept her family from being deported back to Syria. Concerned about the president's positions on immigration, she and her husband, Anas Almoustafa, looked to an alternative. \"From the TV,\" says Almoustafa, \"they [were] saying a lot of immigrants, they go to Canada.\" In March 2017, the family did what they had seen on TV and what more than 46,000 people have done since the 2016 election. They walked across the border from the U.S. to Canada, away from official entry points, and applied for asylum. \"People are crossing that way because of the safe third country agreement,\" says Maureen Silcoff, president of the Canadian Association of Refugee Lawyers. Signed in 2002, the agreement operates from the assumption that both the U.S. and Canada offer protections, so people fleeing their homes should apply for asylum in either country they arrive in first. That kind of deal has gained renewed attention as the Trump administration presses Mexico and Guatemala to take in asylum-seekers traveling through those countries to the U.S. As America's policies push more migrants to head across its northern border, Canadians and rights groups have challenged the agreement with the U.S. Under the accord, people leaving the U.S. cannot apply for asylum in Canada at an official crossing point, or vice versa. Except for a few limited cases, such as if they have close family in Canada, they will be turned back to the U.S. However, what some call a \"loophole\" in the agreement allows people to apply for asylum in Canada if they can arrive in the country. Anas Almoustafa says he and his family got the idea to travel to Canada from the U.S., where they were in legal limbo, from TV.\n                \n                    \n                    Emma Jacobs/NPR\n                    \n                \nhide caption Anas Almoustafa says he and his family got the idea to travel to Canada from the U.S., where they were in legal limbo, from TV. \"People feel hopeless about their chances of receiving protection in the United States,\" Silcoff says. \"That essentially drives them to cross between ports of entry.\" Most have traversed one country road on the border of upstate New York and the province of Quebec. Royal Canadian Mounted Police wait on the other side of this unofficial path to apprehend them. The total number of migrant interceptions since 2016 still pales in comparison to 100,000 on the U.S.-Mexico border this March alone. Numbers have also trended downward this year over last. But Canadian pollster Shachi Kurl of the Angus Reid Institute says the border situation took on an outsize political importance because Canadians were unaccustomed to these types of arrivals. \"Just literally walking across an undefended border was starting to create a deep sense of unease and concern not just in right-wing voters, but it was really an issue that crossed the political spectrum,\" she says. Canada's opposition Conservative Party has picked up this theme in its campaign to unseat Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's Liberal government in federal elections this fall. In a speech in May, Conservative leader Andrew Scheer called the numbers of irregular crossings \"almost hard to believe,\" protesting that some migrants are able to \"exploit loopholes and skip the line.\" Trudeau's government has made a number of changes in the last two years to try to reduce the number of arrivals. The Canadian government sent representatives abroad to discourage people considering traveling to the border and to temper perceptions of the welcome they would receive. Trudeau also created a new Cabinet-level border security minister, a position filled by former Toronto police chief Bill Blair. Earlier this year, Blair met with then-U.S. Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen about expanding the safe third country agreement so Canada could turn border-crossers back to the U.S. His office declined an interview with NPR but said the two countries have not begun official negotiations. However, even as the U.S. pushes for similar agreements with Mexico and Guatemala to give migrants heading for the U.S. border asylum in their countries, groups like Amnesty International Canada are urging Canada to withdraw from its asylum deal. Arguing that the U.S. does not offer equal protections for immigrants, Amnesty Canada director Alex Neve says Canada should allow people to make asylum claims at all official border crossings. \"At a time when refugees and migrants, a very vulnerable group, face this full-out attack on their rights from the U.S. government, Canada shouldn't be turning its back on them,\" Neve tells NPR. Amnesty has joined with other organizations in a lawsuit to overturn the agreement. Hearings will begin in November. Silcoff, the attorney, pointed out that U.S. policy changes that have, for example, closed eligibility for asylum to victims of domestic violence, whereas she noted, \"They have a good chance because of our laws of receiving protection in Canada.\" Despite their rejection in the U.S., Baserbashi's family was approved for asylum in Canada last year. \"This is the final step we hope and final move \u2014 absolutely it's [the] final move \u2014 because we get approved, thanks God!\" she says. Her family would receive a different reception if they arrived today. The Canadian government passed one more measure this summer, tucked into a large budget bill. The provision bars people from applying for asylum in Canada if they applied previously in the United States or a handful of other countries with which Canada shares biometric data. Those who have applied elsewhere will now enter an alternative administrative process that Silcoff says offers fewer protections. A spokesperson for Minister Blair's office said in an email to NPR that the change was meant to \"deter people from making multiple asylum claims in different countries,\" but added, \"Nobody will be removed without a chance to be heard.\"",

Updated at on July 18 at 1:52 p.m. ET President Trump continued his attacks against four freshman Democratic congresswomen at a campaign rally in Greenville, N.C., on Wednesday, with the crowd breaking into a chant of \"send her back\" against one, echoing the president's racist message from the weekend. Trump on Thursday disavowed the chant. But Wednesday night, Trump piled on Minnesota Democratic Rep. Ilhan Omar, who immigrated to the U.S. as a refugee from Somalia as a child. Egged on by several false explosive claims against the Muslim congresswoman, Trump's supporters broke into the chant. It's the latest fanning of flames by Trump after he tweeted on Sunday that the four progressive members \u2014 Omar, New York Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, Michigan Rep. Rashida Tlaib and Massachusetts Rep. Ayanna Pressley \u2014 should \"go back and help fix the totally broken and crime infested places from which they came.\" All four are American citizens who are women of color, and all except Omar were born in the United States. Trump has repeatedly refused to apologize even as the House passed a measure condemning his remarks. Omar responded in a tweet on Wednesday night, quoting the late Maya Angelou by saying, in part, \"You may kill me with your hatefulness, But still, like air, I'll rise.\" You may shoot me with your words,You may cut me with your eyes,You may kill me with your hatefulness,But still, like air, I\u2019ll rise.-Maya Angelou https://t.co/46jcXSXF0B Asked if the campaign would disavow the \"send her back\" chant, Trump campaign communications director Tim Murtaugh said in a statement: \"The Squad, as they call themselves, are now the leaders of the Democrat Party. Americans don't like it when elected officials consistently disparage this country. All the Democrats are pushing socialist ideas that are terrible for America. They are all the same.\" Later in the afternoon on Thursday, a reporter asked Trump directly why he did not stop the chant. He said, \"I started speaking very quickly.\" Trump did not chastise the crowd at the rally and paused for several seconds while the chant was audible. \"I was not happy with it. I disagree with it,\" he said Thursday in the Oval Office. Crowd at tonight's Trump rally in North Carolina breaks out into chants of \"Send her back!\" as the president attacks Rep. Ilhan Omar pic.twitter.com/0q5L39W61h During Wednesday night's rally, Trump ticked off his alleged grievances with each of the four women, painting them as taking anti-American stances. With Ocasio-Cortez, he said her name was too long to learn how to say and simply called her \"Cortez.\" \"They're always telling us how to run [the country]... you know, if they don't love it, tell 'em to leave it,\" Trump said. Community response to Trump's attacks While the Trump-friendly crowd may have cheered his doubling down on his racist remarks, that sentiment isn't shared throughout the greater city of Greenville and on the campus of East Carolina University, where Trump's rally was held. Trump narrowly won North Carolina, but he lost Pitt County, which is about a third African-American and about 6% Latino.

Kenneth Hammond is the interim pastor at Sycamore Hill Missionary Baptist Church, an African American community of worship which was burned to the ground by an arsonist in 1969. Hammond said Trump's language was unmistakable, and was a trope frequently used during the fight for civil rights. \"We as a people and we as a congregation have had firsthand experiences on how racist activities can impact people of faith... When you hear the rhetoric of going back from where you came from \u2014 for many of our folk, that's two blocks from here, so we are well invested in this country,\" Hammond said. \"The contributions that we've made to the success of this country are well-documented.\" Images of former congregants as well as an image of the church's former building hang on the wall at Sycamore Hill Missionary Baptist Church.\n                \n                    \n                    Madeline Gray for NPR\n                    \n                \nhide caption Images of former congregants as well as an image of the church's former building hang on the wall at Sycamore Hill Missionary Baptist Church. Trump has argued, and did again on Wednesday night, that Democrats are the ones using extremist language, but Hammond said that argument doesn't hold water. \"If it barks like a dog, it looks like a dog. It's a dog. And so it's it's it's racist is racist at its worst level,\" the pastor said. Even some of Trump's supporters in Greenville were dismayed by the tweets, such as Emma Arndt, chairwoman of the newly-formed College Republicans on East Carolina's campus. \"He had a moment. I think that he made a mistake but I think that he can build from it. And I think that he can maybe work on his initial tweets and stuff like that,\" said Arndt, who was at the rally registering voters. Trump delivers 2020 message Much of the rest of the rally was standard Trump fare, but there was a clear emphasis on women at the rally even as the president was on the attack against multiple Democratic women. Fresh off the launch of \"Women for Trump\" this week, signs with that slogan dotted the crowd. The president touted how well the economy was doing for women especially, and he hammered home the country's strong economic success overall \u2014 something most Republican strategists wish he would make more of his main emphasis instead of insults and stoking other controversies. As he usually does at rallies, Trump relived his unlikely 2016 election victory and condemned the \"witch hunt\" against him, even using profanity. This rally was originally scheduled to coincide with former special counsel Robert Mueller's testimony on Capitol Hill, but that has now been delayed for one week. Trump did revel in the failed vote to move forward on articles of impeachment earlier today in the House, which was handily defeated by both Republicans and Democrats. \"That was a slaughter,\" Trump said, conceding that he did \"have to thank most of the Democrats\" for their votes. Many of the Democratic members who voted no want to go through a full process of investigations and hearings before voting.

Trump did turn his attention toward some of his potential 2020 rivals. He mocked former Vice President Joe Biden's lackluster debate performance last month, reviving his nickname of \"Sleepy Joe.\" Trump reveled in Biden's polling slide after California Sen. Kamala Harris's attack against him in last month's first debate about his past opposition to mandated busing in the 1970s. Trump did note that Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren, who he again referred to as \"Pocahontas\" was rising. And he also mocked the pronunciation of South Bend, Ind., Pete Buttigieg's name and said he was unprepared to be president.

L\u00fcbcke, a Christian Democrat, was outspoken in his pro-immigration views. His confessed killer is an avowed neo-Nazi with a 20-plus-year history of violence against immigrants. The assassination last month in Germany of a popular pro-migrant politician has raised alarm about a growing threat of right-wing terrorism. It was the first political assassination by the extreme right since the Nazi regime, and it has shaken the country. Walter L\u00fcbcke, a 65-year-old member of the Christian Democratic Union and a staunch defender of Chancellor Angela Merkel's open-door refugee policy, was shot in the head late at night on June 2 as he sat smoking on his terrace, according to German investigators. The confessed killer is an avowed neo-Nazi with a 20-plus-year history of violence against immigrants. But experts on extremism and some mainstream political leaders suggest the far-right, anti-immigrant Alternative for Germany political party shares at least some of the blame. In recent German history, right-wing attacks have mostly targeted immigrants. The assassination of a prominent German politician is unprecedented, says Hajo Funke, a professor at the Free University of Berlin who studies right-wing extremism. \"So coldblooded, so prepared, so decisive,\" he says. \"That kind of killing is a new step, and that is what, for me, is right-wing terror.\" German officials were still calling L\u00fcbcke's assassination a mystery at the time of his funeral on June 13 in the German state of Hesse, where he was the district president of the city of Kassel. Gun homicides are rare in a country with strict gun laws. The break in the case came on June 15, when a German SWAT team arrested 45-year-old Stephan Ernst, based on DNA evidence collected at the crime scene. Ernst's police record includes an attempt to plant a pipe bomb at a hostel for asylum-seekers in 1993. Investigators say he had ties to neo-Nazi groups, including Combat 18, an extremist group that originated in the United Kingdom, spread to other European countries and has chapters in the U.S. and Canada. Demonstrators hold a banner with the message \"Stop the Right-Wing Violence\" during a June 18 march in Berlin against the killing of politician Walter L\u00fcbcke.\n                \n                    \n                    Christoph Soeder/AFP/Getty Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption Demonstrators hold a banner with the message \"Stop the Right-Wing Violence\" during a June 18 march in Berlin against the killing of politician Walter L\u00fcbcke. \"He was closely associated with leading figures of Combat 18,\" says Daniel Koehler, director of the German Institute on Radicalization and De-radicalization Studies in Stuttgart. \"He was friends with them on Facebook.\" After Ernst was arrested, says Koehler, \"Combat 18, for the first time ever in Germany, released a propaganda video in support of the suspect.\" When Ernst confessed to the killing, he told police he acted alone. But German Interior Minister Horst Seehofer said investigators continue to look for accomplices and a network. Two more arrests were made last week. The case is a \"game changer, an extremely extraordinary incident,\" says Koehler. Leading politicians in Germany now feel under direct threat of violence from far-right extremists. \"It's not that [extremists] didn't want to do it before, but they simply didn't dare,\" says Koehler. Over the weekend, media reports \u2014 confirmed by Germany's domestic intelligence agency \u2014 surfaced of a neo-Nazi network that ordered body bags and compiled a target list of political leaders. When L\u00fcbcke's killer confessed, he also spelled out his motives to investigators. He said he was enraged by comments L\u00fcbcke made in 2015 in support of refugees in Germany. L\u00fcbcke's remarks came during a heated town hall meeting to discuss a new shelter for asylum-seekers, as hundreds of thousands of migrants and refugees began entering the country. Far-right hecklers interrupted the meeting. L\u00fcbcke challenged them. Walter L\u00fcbcke, shown here in 2012, was a staunch supporter of Chancellor Angela Merkel's open-door refugee policy.\n                \n                    \n                    Uwe Zucchi/AFP/Getty Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption Walter L\u00fcbcke, shown here in 2012, was a staunch supporter of Chancellor Angela Merkel's open-door refugee policy. \"There is this famous town hall where he was telling people in the audience, 'If you don't like human rights, you should go,' \" says Mohamed Amjahid, a political reporter for Die Zeit newspaper. \"He was very tough.\" The exchange led to an online hate campaign against L\u00fcbcke, who received death threats. He was provided police protection until the storm eventually subsided. In February, his 2015 town hall comments surfaced again in a video posted by Erika Steinbach, a former CDU member of parliament who broke with her party and aligned herself with the political ideology of the AfD, German's far-right party, now the third-largest in parliament. Her post spurred another storm of hate. \"She herself never actually threatened L\u00fcbcke, but she provided the platform for those who did,\" says Koehler. Koehler connects AfD rhetoric to growing extremism. The AfD's warning of an existential threat to German culture has contributed to extremist violence, he says. Studies produced by his institute show \"a significant link between AfD hate speech directed against refugees and the level of far-right, xenophobic crimes in certain areas,\" Koehler says. A prominent AfD member of parliament was temporarily suspended from Twitter last year after she referred to Muslim men as \"barbaric\" and \"gang-raping hordes.\" \"Statistically, there are three violent, far-right attacks every day in Germany, so that is just significant. We have no other form of violent extremism that presents such a threat,\" Koehler says. When high-ranking AfD members use language that dehumanizes refugees to create an existential threat, he says, that spurs violence: \"Far-right extremists act out on that fear and threat.\" As the L\u00fcbcke assassination investigation continued and alarm rose in Germany, senior members of the CDU charged that the AfD was partly to blame for the politician's death. AfD rhetoric especially demonizes refugees from the Middle East, Funke says. \"There's an ... indirect link,\" he says, \"being utterly against all Muslims, Muslims in this country, Muslims around the world. Unleashing of resentment is one of the conditions for murder and for violence.\" AfD leaders and supporters accuse the CDU of attempting to politicize L\u00fcbcke's death. \"Everybody has to condemn a murder,\" says Armin-Paul Hampel, an AfD member of parliament. Threats, he says, are \"my daily business. I got threatened, including 'We will kill you' and things like that. Nobody complained, by the way, in the German media.\" AfD political leaders have also dismissed fears of an extreme right-wing terrorist network. \"The one gentleman imprisoned is saying nothing. So, let's wait,\" says Hampel. The heated political exchanges come as the AfD hopes to boost its support in a series of local elections in the fall. AfD leaders have accused CDU leaders of \"using a murder to discredit political competitors,\" as an AfD parliamentary leader wrote on Twitter. The AfD has been consistent in criticizing what Hampel calls Merkel's \"illegal open-door policy\" for refugees and asylum-seekers. AfD leaders demand that most, if not all, of the recent arrivals be sent home. Germany's welfare system will collapse, he believes, under the strain of refugees who refuse to integrate. The central message of his party, he says, is \"Do we really want a melting pot from all nationalities, or do we want to keep our identity?\" He insists that message had nothing to do with L\u00fcbcke's assassination.",

A former Guatemalan first lady is the front-runner following Sunday's presidential election in the Central American country, where the electorate is hoping to find a candidate who can tackle its high unemployment, violence and corruption. Sandra Torres, a 64-year-old businesswoman, was leading the polls with nearly 26% of the vote on Monday. Four-time presidential candidate Alejandro Giammattei, 63, a former director of the country's prison system, followed in second with just shy of 14%, according to Guatemala's electoral tribunal. Neither candidate drew enough votes to fend off a runoff election on August 11. They needed more than 50% of votes to win outright. Nearly 20 candidates from different parties were vying to replace incumbent Jimmy Morales, a former television comedian whose term ends in January. Torres, who belongs to the centrist National Unity of Hope (Union Nacional de la Esperanza) party, addressed her supporters on Monday saying she plans to bring the country together and fight corruption. \"The country needs unity: to unite the countryside with the city, to unite the workers with the business community, and also in civil society, in all sectors,\" she said, according to The Guardian. Giammattei of the center-right Vamos party also held a post-voting rally Monday, touching on many of the same issues, \"but added that on immigration he plans to work closely with Mexico to raise living standards in communities near their shared border, which are the country's poorest,\" the Associated Press reported. Businessman Robert Arz\u00fa, Edmond Auguste Mulet Lesieur, a former chief of staff to U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon and Thelma Cabrera, an indigenous rights campaigner, were also in the top rung of vote-getters. More than 8 million citizens are eligible to vote and officials said the large number of candidates was slowing the count. This election was also the first in which Guatemalans who live abroad could cast ballots. The campaign lasted three months, with Torres, running on a platform of investment in health, education and agriculture, maintaining her front-runner status throughout. Torres was married to former President \u00c1lvaro Colom, who served from 2008 to 2012 and has been accused of corruption, but the couple divorced in 2011. Despite their split, Torres has been dogged by allegations of her own illegal campaign financing. As part of an anti-corruption drive by current President Morales, Colom was arrested last year. He is awaiting trial. Morales himself has also become a target of the anti-corruption drive. NPR's Carrie Kahn reports, \"Giammettei, faces corruption questions over his time as head of the country's prisons.\" The AP notes that, \"The campaign season was marked by a chaotic flurry of court rulings, shenanigans, illegal party-switching and allegations of malfeasance ...\" Whoever becomes president will face not only the difficult task of alleviating poverty, corruption and violence, but also of handling increasingly complex relations with the U.S. The Trump administration has pressured Guatemala to become a \"safe third country\" to divert refugees from neighboring El Salvador and Honduras who might otherwise seek asylum in the U.S. via Mexico. According to Voice of America, \"Under the terms of the proposed deal, migrants fleeing persecution in El Salvador and Honduras would be forced to request asylum in Guatemala, a gateway to Mexico and the United States. In all but rare exceptions, those migrants who chose to continue north to the United States without first exploring their chances in Guatemala would be returned to their home countries by U.S. immigration forces.\"",

            "article_content": "The Trump administration is seeking to phase out the main program for Palestinian refugees. But other countries are seeking to make up the money the U.S. has pulled with a conference.  MARY LOUISE KELLY, HOST: Later this month, at a conference in Bahrain, the U.S. will try to generate investment in the Palestinian territories. It's part of a peace deal effort. But the Trump administration has cut its money to the main U.N. agency serving Palestinian refugees. And as NPR's Michele Kelemen reports, that agency is holding its own donors conference at the same time as the Bahrain meeting. MICHELE KELEMEN, BYLINE: The U.N. Relief and Works Agency, or UNRWA, was supposed to be a temporary fix, aiding Palestinian refugees until a political solution could be found in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. With no solution in sight, the organization is now 70 years old. But the Trump administration's negotiator, Jason Greenblatt, argues it is broken. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) JASON GREENBLATT: UNRWA's business model, which is inherently tied to an endlessly and exponentially expanding community of beneficiaries, is in permanent crisis mode; that is why the United States decided that it will no longer commit to funding this irredeemably flawed operation. KELEMEN: Greenblatt told the U.N. Security Council in May that there's no need to wait for a political solution to end the Palestinians' dependency on the U.N. He's promoting the investors meeting in Bahrain on June 25 as a new way to spur development in the Palestinian territories. Gwyn Lewis, who runs UNWRA's operations in the West Bank, says Palestinians do need international investment. GWYN LEWIS: But that can't happen unless you have an educated population, unless there's relative stability. And that's what UNWRA provides; it provides basic services to a significant number of refugees and a very well-respected education system. KELEMEN: When the U.S. cut funds to UNWRA, the European Union, Saudi Arabia, Qatar and other Gulf countries pitched in to keep those schools with half a million students open. But some programs had to be scaled back, and UNWRA couldn't replace retiring teachers, says Matthias Schmale, who works in Gaza. MATTHIAS SCHMALE: The next big issue now is, do we have enough money to open the next school year, at the end of August? And right now we don't. KELEMEN: He says UNWRA is hoping to raise $1.2 billion when donors get together at the U.N. on June 25. U.S. officials will be in Bahrain that day, laying out alternatives for development. Schmale says the Palestinians are leery. SCHMALE: You will not find anyone who will argue against economic recovery; the question is, at what political price. Now, if this would come at the cost of giving up the right to statehood or the right to full political participation in a state, Palestinians will reject that; that's very clear. KELEMEN: The Trump administration has not said whether its peace plan will call for a Palestinian state, and U.S. officials may not release it until after a new round of elections in Israel this fall. In the meantime, Gwyn Lewis says UNWRA has to fulfill its mandate. LEWIS: Just looking forward unless, you know, there is something very constructive in terms of a peace agreement moving forward, UNWRA's going to be around for least a couple more years. So without the U.S., I don't think we're very sustainable. KELEMEN: As she and her colleague made the rounds in Washington, they spent much of their time on Capitol Hill. The Democratic-led House Appropriations Committee is taking steps to restore funding for UNWRA and for U.S. programs that help Palestinians. Michele Kelemen, NPR News, the State Department.

Beto O'Rourke is borrowing a different allusion from American history. \"We've called for ... an investment commensurate with John F. Kennedy's moonshot,\" O'Rourke told NPR. \"We're going to invest in the technologies that will allow us to lead the world on this. It should be happening right here in the United States.\" O'Rourke continued to evoke the 20th century with a callback to the \"greatest generation.\" He wants America to rise to the challenge of protecting the climate just as it did in resisting Nazism during World War II. Since announcing his candidacy and out-fundraising most of his fellow competitors on the first day of his campaign, O'Rourke has failed to maintain his momentum in the polls. The candidate hopes that his face-to-face approach and grassroots fundraising will set him apart. \"This campaign, that is run entirely by people \u2014 no PACs, no lobbyists, no corporations, no special interests \u2014 is at the heart of bringing people into this democracy to make sure that we meet this challenge,\" O'Rourke said. O'Rourke spoke with Morning Edition as part of the show's Opening Arguments conversations, exploring the presidential candidates' core messages. On whether the oil industry can continue operating the way it is No, we're going to have to free ourselves from the dependence we have on fossil fuels and that means a greater investment in solar and wind. ... Again, we're making progress in this country, but so are other countries. And I want us to win that race. We've called for ... an investment commensurate with John F. Kennedy's moonshot. We're going to invest in the technologies that will allow us to lead the world on this. It should be happening right here in the United States. On making sacrifices to combat climate change We're going to have to make an investment as a country. It is not going to necessarily be easy. But you talked about the \"greatest generation\" and we just celebrated the 75th anniversary of D-Day \u2014 that was this country meeting the existential threat of that day, of Nazi Germany, making the United States and the world safe for democracy. Here's our generation's opportunity to meet a true existential threat of this moment. And I'm confident that that's going to bring out the absolute best in us. Nothing to be afraid of, something to meet head on, and to overcome and to do it together. On curbing asylum-seekers First of all, I would treat every asylum-seeker with the dignity and respect that they deserve as human beings. I would resource the Department of Homeland Security, Health and Human Services, the Office of Refugee Resettlement commensurate with the demand and the need that they face. But I would also go to the heart of the problem in Guatemala, in El Salvador, in Honduras and ensure that we're working collaboratively with communities, with partner nations in the Western Hemisphere to reduce violence at home and address the fact that they are trying to survive. ... In other words, try to ensure that they don't have to make that 2,000-mile journey in the first place. If we meet them after they've done that with walls or cages or whatever this administration is doing, then it is a failure. We should be able to address this challenge there. On ending conflicts in the Eastern Hemisphere I'm going to make sure that we end the wars in Afghanistan, and Iraq, and Syria, and Somalia, and Yemen and Libya. We've got to find a way to peacefully, diplomatically convene other players and stakeholders in these regions to resolve otherwise intractable problems or else let's expect to find ourselves at war 10, 15, 20 years from now. ... I will not put the life of an American service member on the line unless that is the option of last resort. And in those countries, that is not the last resort right now. There are other options available to us. On whether he can persuade Iran to reenter a nuclear nonproliferation deal We will have to but it's going to be really hard. Not only does Iran no longer trust us, but some of our closest allies cannot take our word for granted. ... The world wants to know \u2014 is the future a democratic one or an autocratic one? And I want to make sure that the United States leads on that, clearly that it's democratic. We're going to stand up for those values here at home \u2014 a badly compromised democracy that must be repaired. But we're also going to stand up for those values abroad. That's how you ensure that you get the kinds of agreements that allow us to improve upon what President Barack Obama was able to negotiate with Iran and get to the next set of policy goals with that country.

            "article_content": "The Justice Department agrees to provide some report material to a House panel. Opioid maker Insys Therapeutics files for bankruptcy protection. The number of people fleeing Venezuela tops 4 million.  STEVE INSKEEP, HOST: The Justice Department will turn over documents to Congress after all. RACHEL MARTIN, HOST: Right. So for weeks now, House leaders have been demanding information from the Trump administration. And again and again, the administration has said, no, you're not getting it. The information includes underlying evidence gathered by special counsel Robert Mueller as he looked at Russia's support for President Trump's election. Now both sides say they reached a deal for lawmakers to actually see this evidence. INSKEEP: Ryan Lucas covers the Justice Department for NPR News. He's in our studios. Ryan, good morning. RYAN LUCAS, BYLINE: Good morning, Steve. INSKEEP: What are lawmakers getting to see, so far as you know? LUCAS: Well, this is a deal between the House Judiciary Committee and the Justice Department. The committee's chairman is a Democrat, Jerry Nadler. He's been waging, basically, a pretty public battle against the Department and the attorney general to get his hands on more materials from Mueller's investigation. The committee even subpoenaed these documents. Under this agreement, they will now get their hands on some of them. We don't know the full scope, at this point, of what they'll be able to see. Neither the Department nor Nadler or other lawmakers are actually saying right now. What Nadler has said, though, is that the Department will hand over what he calls key evidence that Mueller used to assess whether the president or others in the administration obstructed justice or engaged in some other misconduct. He says that lawmakers need these materials in order to carry out what he says are their constitutional duties to figure out what they want to do about those allegations against the president in the Mueller report. INSKEEP: Let's remember, there were a couple big parts of the Mueller report. One was, what did Russia do in the election? And was there some kind of conspiracy with the Trump campaign? The other thing was, did President Trump obstruct justice? And it sounds like these documents relate to that latter thing, we think. LUCAS: That is correct. INSKEEP: OK. So that's what the deal entails. How does that compare, so far as we know, with what the Democrats want? LUCAS: Well, remember, Democrats initially wanted the full, unredacted Mueller report and all of the underlying evidence. Remember, there were four categories of materials that were blacked out in the version that was made public. Those include grand jury materials, things that could reveal sensitive intelligence matters. The Justice Department made a less redacted version available to a select group of congressional leaders. That was not enough for Democrats. There's been a lot of back-and-forth between the committee and the Department. Democrats also want the underlying materials that investigators collected. Now, that includes FBI interviews with witnesses, notes or memos from White House aides. They say that those materials are critical to understand how and why investigators made the decisions that they did and to get the full scope of the allegation against the president. INSKEEP: And just to be clear, the House Democrats are not at this point saying we want this stuff for an impeachment inquiry, right? They're looking into the Mueller report, but not actually going for impeachment at the moment. LUCAS: They are not talking about impeachment right now. This is about drawing conclusions from the information that they can get. INSKEEP: Help me understand here. Even though there is this deal, the House is going ahead with a resolution today targeting attorney general William Barr. LUCAS: That is correct. So the House is going to vote on a resolution that would authorize the Judiciary Committee to go to court to enforce its subpoenas against the attorney general, William Barr, and against former White House counsel Don McGahn. Remember, the White House has refused to allow McGahn to testify before the committee or to turn over documents to the committee. This is something that has really, really angered Democrats. They've doubled down, pointed to that to enforce their accusations that the White House is essentially trying to obstruct a congressional investigation. Now, today's vote fast-tracks the authority for other committees to go to courts to enforce their subpoenas as well. But the important point here is that the House is not voting to hold Bill Barr in contempt of Congress. That would've been a much bigger deal. The last-minute agreement that they struck seems to - averted that, at least for now. INSKEEP: So one set of documents is being turned over, plenty of other debates and disputes about other kinds of evidence and other investigations. LUCAS: Right. INSKEEP: Ryan, thanks so much. LUCAS: Thank you. INSKEEP: That is NPR's Ryan Lucas. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) INSKEEP: All right. A drug company blamed for a role in the opioids crisis has now filed for bankruptcy. It's a company once notorious for its sales practices. (SOUNDBITE OF SONG, \"GREAT BY CHOICE\") Z REAL: (Rapping) Insys Therapeutics, that is our name. We're raising the bar, and we're changing the game. To be great, it takes a decision to be better than the competition... INSKEEP: OK. MARTIN: Wow. Yeah. So that's a clip from a video about the company, which is called Insys Therapeutics. They use this video to train sales reps. The video also featured a person dressed up as a giant bottle of the company's fentanyl spray. Prosecutors played this video as evidence in a trial against Insys executives, who were convicted last month. INSKEEP: North Country Public Radio's Brian Mann covers opioid legislation or opioid litigation for NPR. He's been following this story closely. He joins us via Skype. Hey there, Brian. BRIAN MANN, BYLINE: Hi, Steve. INSKEEP: So what went wrong, ultimately, for this company? MANN: Yeah. You know, Insys sold a quarter billion dollars of products just a couple of years ago. This Subsys product with fentanyl in it, it was their biggest product. But it turns out this was really addictive and a really dangerous drug, like so many that the pharmaceutical industry marketed in recent years. So the company pleaded guilty to a series of felony charges, including claims that they bribed doctors to prescribe their medication, pushing it to patients who shouldn't have been using it. They're going to pay the government $225 million in penalties. And then company founder John Kapoor and four other Insys executives, as you mentioned, they were convicted last month on racketeering charges. INSKEEP: That is pretty direct, when the company is admitting to bribing doctors to prescribe an addictive medication. If you want to find somebody involved in the opioids crisis, it's harder to get more - hard to get more direct than that. But why did the company need to take the step of filing for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection? MANN: Right. So they settled with the federal government - Insys did - but there's still a lot of other opioid-related lawsuits out there pending against the company. So in a statement yesterday, CEO Andrew Long described those legacy legal challenges as one of the problems the company faces. And to cap all that, Steve, you know, sales of their products have plummeted. So they've announced they'll go through bankruptcy proceedings. They'll try to resolve all these liabilities and then just see what's left of the company. INSKEEP: Oh, yeah. People are prescribing - doctors are prescribing fewer opioids these days. And they're being pushed... MANN: That's right. INSKEEP: ...By the government to prescribe fewer opioids these days, which I guess mean fewer profits for the company. So could other companies be following this one into bankruptcy? MANN: You know, the big companies - Johnson & Johnson, McKesson, Walmart, CBS - they have really deep pockets, a lot of assets. They're not likely to go this route. But executives at companies like Purdue Pharma, the maker of Oxycontin - that really controversial opioid - they've already floated the possibility of bankruptcy. And this is being talked about in courtrooms across the country. Remember, more than 1,800 state and local governments now have filed these opioid-related suits. So penalties and settlements could run into the tens of billions of dollars, rivaling those Big Tobacco settlements of the 1990s. And so the question really is, how much can these companies pay without going out of business? INSKEEP: Will bankruptcy filings mean that state and local governments, who say they need this money to treat people and help people, that they'll be out of luck? MANN: Well, the company - the attorneys representing those local governments say they're going to now dig through what's left at Insys, see if there are some assets there. They say their goal is not to bankrupt these companies. They're looking to get money, though, to communities that do need help right now, helping with this epidemic that's still raging in much of the country. INSKEEP: Brian Mann, thanks so much. MANN: Thank you, Steve. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) INSKEEP: All right. The United Nations is now reporting the number of people fleeing Venezuela has topped 4 million. MARTIN: Yeah. That number reflects those who have left the country since 2015. One million refugees have fled in the last seven months alone. This is all because of the economic and political crisis there in Venezuela. President Nicolas Maduro and the opposition leader, Juan Guaido, are still in this standoff over who is actually the country's legitimate leader. Meanwhile, the U.N. refugee agency, UNHCR, and the International Organization for Migration have released this joint statement saying Venezuelans are now one of the largest population groups displaced from their country. INSKEEP: Reporter John Otis has been talking with Venezuelans both inside and outside the country in recent weeks. And he's on the line. Hi there, John. JOHN OTIS: Hi, Steve. INSKEEP: Let's start in Venezuela, where I know you recently were. What conditions did you see? OTIS: Well, it was really quite bad. One of the first things you'll notice there these days are the epic gas lines. People are sleeping in their cars for up to a week in order to fill up their gas tanks. That's partly because the oil industry has collapsed and also due to U.S. sanctions, and Venezuela needs to import chemicals to produce gasoline. And then sometimes drivers would get up to the gas pump, and the electricity would go out. So then they wouldn't be able to fill up their tanks anyway after waiting in line for so long. I was in a port town where people would board flimsy boats to try to immigrate, try to get to the nearby islands of Aruba and Curacao. And then, also, hyperinflation is very evident. There's even a shortage of currency because you need so much to buy things. INSKEEP: Yeah. OTIS: The bolivar, which is the Venezuelan currency, is almost worthless, and the largest bill is only about 10 cents. So it's a pretty grim picture. INSKEEP: So I know a lot of people decide they can't take it anymore. They leave the country. Our colleague Ari Shapiro has reported on some of the dramatic stories of people who flee Venezuela going westward into Colombia, where you now are. Has that refugee flow grown even larger in the last few weeks? OTIS: Yeah. It's really big. Colombia now has 1.3 million refugees. It shares a long border with Colombia, so this is sort of the main destination point. And something like 1 million have fled from Venezuela in just the last six or seven months, according to the U.N. Venezuelans are also going to Peru, Ecuador and Brazil. They seem to want to stay in Latin America to a large degree because, if there ever is a change of government at home, they're a little bit closer in order to get back. And then one upside that sometimes doesn't get mentioned in this refugee crisis is that a lot of these migrants are - find work in these countries, and they're able to send U.S. dollars back to their loved ones in Venezuela. And so many Venezuelans these days depend on U.S. dollars to survive. INSKEEP: And it was a kind of middle-class country. I'm sure a lot of the people have skills and education and things they can contribute. But are the Latin American countries, the neighbors, able to absorb so many people? OTIS: You know, there is some growing xenophobia. Peru is now putting new restrictions on the influx of Venezuelans into their country, requiring a visa. But other countries have had an open-door policy so far, but we'll have to see if that continues as the Venezuela crisis gets worse. (SOUNDBITE OF KLEERUP'S \"GLAS\") INSKEEP: John, thanks for the update, really appreciate your reporting. OTIS: Thank you, Steve.

Europe's once-powerful Social Democratic parties have been losing steam for decades, a trend that continued in the recent European Parliament elections. In Germany, the party's leader quit after particularly terrible results. But in Denmark, the Social Democrats are holding their own and appear poised to take back the reins of government after Wednesday's national election. What's their secret? The last time Danes voted in parliamentary elections, in 2015, Europe's migration crisis was at a boiling point. Support for the populist, anti-immigrant Danish People's Party surged to 21%, a few percentage points behind the Social Democrats, but enough to help carry the current center-right coalition into power. Many voters supporting the Danish People's Party were former Social Democrats. On taking over as the Social Democrats' new leader shortly thereafter, Mette Frederiksen gave a hint of what was to come: \"I know that many Danes are worried about the future,\" she said. \"Worried about jobs, about open borders. About whether we can find a balance in immigration policy.\" In 2015, about 21,000 migrants sought asylum in Denmark, a number that has fallen dramatically every year since. But Denmark's demographics have been changing for decades. According to government figures, in 1980 about 1% of Danish residents were of \"non-Western background,\" compared with 8.5% today. Morten \u00d8stergaard, the leader of Denmark's Social Liberal party, speaks with reporters on election night on Wednesday in Copenhagen. His party is in a position to make or break a future left-wing government with its demands. It is pro-immigration, pro-Europe and pro-environment.\n                \n                    \n                    Ole Jensen/Getty Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption Morten \u00d8stergaard, the leader of Denmark's Social Liberal party, speaks with reporters on election night on Wednesday in Copenhagen. His party is in a position to make or break a future left-wing government with its demands. It is pro-immigration, pro-Europe and pro-environment. Within months of the 2015 election, Frederiksen was expressing more specific thoughts on migration. \"In my eyes, it is neither heroic nor humane to bring so many people here that the problems become huge in our own country,\" she said in an interview on Denmark's TV2. \"Because we're not very good at integrating in Denmark, and there's nothing to indicate that we're going to get better.\" Since then, Denmark's Social Democrats have tacked hard right on immigration. Working closely with colleagues across the aisle in Parliament, they passed laws aimed at sending \u2014 or keeping \u2014 refugees to their home countries, rather than integrating them. Their platform includes a \"Marshall Plan\" for Africa, intended to stem the flow of migration by improving conditions at the source. But Social Democratic party members have also played a part in headline-grabbing initiatives more commonly associated with hardliners, like a law allowing police to seize jewelry and other assets from refugees, a burqa ban and a plan to put certain rejected asylum-seekers on an island previously used for infectious disease research. It's a strategy that has worked inasmuch as it has lured voters back from the right and kept the party afloat. Largely as a result of the Social Democrats' success in this area, the Danish People's Party is in free fall, now with just 9% of the vote. (The party has also been hurt by the launch of two other parties that are even more anti-immigrant, though they remain relatively small). But the Social Democrats' success has come at a price. While the party's immigration strategy has brought many right-leaning voters back into the fold, it has also sent others fleeing further left. In fact, the Social Democrats' 26% plurality in this week's election is a pinch less than what the party won in 2015. Frederiksen is now in a strong position to become the country's next prime minister, thanks to the explosive growth of the three smaller parties in her left-wing bloc, whose votes she will need to form a government. Those parties have expressed support for the idea of Frederiksen as Denmark's next leader, but their backing hinges on obtaining a variety of concessions. Among them: more investment in childcare programs, a stronger commitment to the environment, changes in some economic policies and \u2014 especially \u2014 a softening of the Social Democrats' stance on immigration. One party in particular, the Social Liberals, is in a position to make or break a future left-wing government with its demands. Though the party actually falls at the very center of the country's political spectrum, it has managed to position itself as the antidote to right-wing populism: It is pro-immigration, pro-Europe and pro-environment. While the Social Liberals' stated priority is to be part of a center-left government, leader Morten \u00d8stergaard appeared lukewarm on election night, saying, \"There are many possible ways to form a parliamentary majority after this election. ... I feel obligated to give Mette a chance, and I've said for months that we'll do that, but it depends on how much the political course changes.\" What will follow now is a series of inter-party negotiations that political scientists say could go on for days or even weeks. \"Rhetorically the two sides are really juxtaposed at the moment, each in their corner of the ring, and saying we're not going to move at all,\" says Aarhus University political scientist Rune Stubager. \"It will be potentially a very long poker game.\" Stubager predicts that the Social Democrats will fight to maintain voter credibility by holding the \"main lines\" on immigration \u2014 presumably some version of the current stance \u2014 while softening \"bits and pieces\" with broad support. \"But then, of course, the question is what constitutes the main lines, and what are the bits and pieces that may be changed, and that's unclear,\" he says. Should discord within the left bloc prove too great to overcome, the outgoing center-right prime minister has extended the option of a grand coalition across the center line, which would be an unprecedented development in Danish politics. Until then, conservative leaders say they'll fill the popcorn bowl, sit back and watch. No doubt Europe's Social Democrats will be doing the same.",

RASCOE: So really, this trip overall was about showing how close the U.S. and Japan are, how close Trump and Abe are. And that was on display here at the press conference. Abe, in particular, was very complimentary of Trump. He repeatedly said how he wanted to praise Trump for taking a new approach with North Korea. He even said that Trump was responsible for cracking Kim Jong Un's shell of distrust. But, as you mentioned, there were some divisions there. Trump downplayed North Korea's latest missile launches. And Abe had this to say. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) PRIME MINISTER SHINZO ABE: (Speaking Japanese). INSKEEP: I guess we should do a little translation here... RASCOE: For those that don't speak... INSKEEP: Yeah. Go ahead, please. RASCOE: Yeah. For those that don't speak Japanese, he called the test a violation of the U.N. Security Council resolution. And he said it was regrettable that this happened. So even though the countries are saying they're on the same page - and, largely, they do seem to be - there are some differences there. INSKEEP: What else was the president saying as he stood next to the Japanese prime minister? RASCOE: Well, over and over again, Trump was talking about how he expects to make all these deals on national security or on trade with various countries. What you didn't hear was how he will actually make it happen. He said he expects an agreement with China. Here's more on that. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: I think sometime in the future, China and the United States will absolutely have a great trade deal. And we look forward to that. RASCOE: But he didn't say how those two countries will be able to come together. Talks have really fallen apart. The countries are now trading tariffs and retaliating against each other. He's also talking about a quick deal with Japan and said there may be a big announcement on this by August. But he didn't say how those countries are going to come together on the issue of car imports. Japan does not want tariffs. And Trump has said that he's looking at that. He's considering it, and he hasn't taken that off the table. INSKEEP: Let me ask about one thing that was said there about China, Ayesha. Is this correct? The president also said China wants to make a deal. They're ready to make a deal with us, the United States, but we're not ready to make a deal. Did he say, again, he's comfortable just having higher and higher tariffs against China? RASCOE: That was much of what he was saying. Obviously, he continues to state inaccurately that China is paying all the tariffs. It is importers who are paying - U.S. importers who are paying the tariffs. But he basically is now kind of saying that China wishes they would have made the deal; they're kind of suffering. And we - and now we're not ready to make a deal. They have to kind of come to us, basically - or come to the U.S. to make the deal. INSKEEP: But the U.S. is selling a bunch of F-35 fighter planes to Japan. RASCOE: Yeah. So this is a product of Japan's efforts, obviously, to build up their military, but also to win over some favor from the U.S. and lower that trade deficit which Trump is so concerned about. So this is a way - these F-35s are not cheap. And so they cost a lot of money. INSKEEP: OK. Ayesha, thanks so much. RASCOE: Thank you. INSKEEP: That's NPR's Ayesha Rascoe. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) INSKEEP: OK, huge election result here - centrists in Europe have lost their majority. KING: That's right. Over the weekend, the European Union held parliamentary elections. Nationalist and far-right parties gained seats, but they did not win in a landslide that a lot of people had predicted. Liberals and Green parties also did very well. And it's notable that this was the highest turnout for European elections in 25 years. INSKEEP: NPR's Sylvia Poggioli has been following the elections from Rome. Hi there, Sylvia. SYLVIA POGGIOLI, BYLINE: Hi, Steve. INSKEEP: What do you make of all this? POGGIOLI: Well, the bottom line is, as you said, the populists did well in some countries. But those fearful forecasts of a hard-right victory across the EU did not pan out. One reason seems to be a very high turnout - overall, something like 51% compared to 43% five years ago. And that's apparently thanks to young, pro-EU voters who cast ballots for Greens. Those parties scored very well in Northern Europe. The populists did succeed in depriving the center-left and center-right parties of the majority they held for 40 years in the European Parliament. They've gained 5% from the last EU elections. But populists are expected to get only around 25% of Parliament seats. Nevertheless, there were some standout populist victories. Here's the victorious Matteo Salvini, Italian deputy prime minister and leader of the hard-right League. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) MATTEO SALVINI: (Speaking Italian). POGGIOLI: So, clutching a rosary, Salvini said, \"not only is the League the top party in Italy. Marine Le Pen is the top party in France. Nigel Farage is the top party in the U.K. So Italy, France, the U.K. - it's a sign of Europe that's changing.\" And, you know, Marine Le Pen's hard-right party came in ahead of the party of French President Emmanuel Macron, the champion of a stronger EU. And the League, here in Italy, scored 34%, and that makes it the biggest party in the EU Parliament. INSKEEP: Well, what is driving the far-right in multiple countries to gain? POGGIOLI: Well, you know, EU bureaucrats have been accused of dealing very poorly with many recent issues. There was the economic stagnation following the global financial crisis, very high unemployment rates, especially among the young in Southern Europe, mass-casualty terrorist attacks that raised concerns over lack of security - but of course, most of all, the refugee crisis that led to an influx of unprecedented numbers of migrants in Europe. Populists have fueled fears and anxiety over what they call an invasion. Here's the autocratic prime minister of Hungary, Viktor Orban, whose party scored more than 50% in the EU vote. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) PRIME MINISTER VIKTOR ORBAN: We reject migration. And we would like to see leaders in position of European Unions who reject the migration, who would like to stop it and not to manage it. INSKEEP: OK. Sylvia, from that one quote, we can figure out what far-right means in Hungary. But does it mean the same in all European countries? What do they all stand for? POGGIOLI: No. There's a - you know, they're not united on all issues. For example, Italy's Salvini wants much looser rules on budgetary discipline. That's rejected by German and other North European populists. Salvini also wants other member states to take in many of the refugees that are in Italy. Hungary's Orban and other East Europeans rule that out. So they won't be able - the populists won't be able to reshape the European Union in their image, but they could seriously obstruct and slow down the whole legislative process. INSKEEP: Sylvia, thanks for your insights. POGGIOLI: Thank you, Steve. INSKEEP: That's NPR's Sylvia Poggioli in Rome. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) INSKEEP: In this country, the state of Oklahoma has settled with a second pharmaceutical company for its role in the opioid crisis. Israel-based Teva Pharmaceuticals will be paying the state $85 million. That follows an earlier settlement with Purdue Pharma, the makers of the painkiller OxyContin, for $270 million. KING: Yeah, this case against Teva isn't unusual. It's one of hundreds happening across the country. Local and state governments are suing the drug industry. They say the companies marketed and incentivized the sale of opioids, and that contributed to hundreds of thousands of overdose deaths across the country. In the state of Oklahoma alone, thousands of people have died. INSKEEP: We're joined now by Brian Mann of North Country Public Radio, who covers opioid litigation for NPR - which, Brian, I guess, gives you a lot to do. BRIAN MANN, BYLINE: Yeah, there's a lot these days. INSKEEP: And good morning. How important is this latest settlement? MANN: Well, there's a big practical side to this, Steve. Local governments in Oklahoma will now get some cash to help pay for things like law enforcement and rehab programs that could save lives. But this is also part of a growing trend, with drug companies around the U.S. trying to get out from under this legal and public-relations cloud. They're accused of getting millions of Americans hooked on opioid medications through the use of this aggressive and misleading marketing. And that's just been a huge burden on the entire industry. INSKEEP: Now, the news here is out of Oklahoma. But we should note there are many governments - state and local governments - in many states who are suing pharmaceutical companies. And I gather you've been travelling around talking with people in some of the areas that are suing. MANN: That's right. I traveled out to Summit County, Ohio, to see how that local community is dealing with this and the costs. And I spoke to Richard Milhof. He's struggled with addiction himself. And says a lot of his neighbors got hooked on these prescription opioid medications. RICHARD MILHOF: A lot my friends are passed away. They've overdosed and died... MANN: I'm very sorry. I hope... MILHOF: Almost every single friend that I had, that I grew up with, is dead because of it. INSKEEP: Wow. One sense of the human cost. And then there's the dollar cost in government after government after government. MANN: That's right. This heavy burden is falling on local governments around the country. They're paying for everything from law enforcement to, you know, needle exchange programs. I spoke with Donna Skoda, who heads Summit County's public health department. And she told me about kind of a surprising aspect of this, Steve. The county's budget exploded because of the need for new foster care. DONNA SKODA: The increase in the number of children they've had to take for safety reasons, I mean, it's just doubled - and then not to mention the children that have been orphaned. So it just complicates everything. But it has been devastating. MANN: In this one Ohio county, taxpayers have spent nearly $70 million the last few years responding to this crisis. Local officials across the U.S. say this is the kind of financial burden that Big Pharma should pay for. INSKEEP: Brian, I think your reporting is suggesting to us why it might be that not all pharmaceutical companies have settled their lawsuits - because they might face lawsuit after lawsuit after lawsuit in city after city and state after state, right? MANN: That's exactly right. And of course, back in Oklahoma there is still a suit there against Johnson & Johnson, one of the nation's biggest corporations, the biggest drug maker. They've denied any wrongdoing. But, you know, if big firms like this are found liable for cleaning up the opioid mess, the payouts could grow fast from the millions of dollars into the billions. So this is going to be watched very closely. INSKEEP: Brian, thanks so much. MANN: Thank you, Steve. INSKEEP: That's Brian Mann of North Country Public Radio. Copyright \u00a9 2019 NPR.

            "article_content": "Germans haven't cared so much in the past about elections to the European Union Parliament, but Brexit has refocused attention on the institutions that make the E.U. work.  AUDIE CORNISH, HOST: This week's vote for representatives to European Parliament has taken on new urgency. Right-wing populist parties across the continent have pledged to band together and hollow out the European Union's authority from within, and establishment parties are feeling the pinch. NPR's Lucian Kim reports from Germany, which, like most of the continent, will vote on Sunday. LUCIAN KIM, BYLINE: Sergey Lagodinsky is a candidate for the European Parliament who epitomizes the German Green Party - liberal, eco-conscious and very pro-European. SERGEY LAGODINSKY: I do think that we are running out of time. We're running out of time in terms of our environmental policies, and we are losing time to secure our internal European democracy. KIM: Lagodinsky and his family came to Germany as refugees from Russia in 1993, so he has a very personal take on the rise of anti-immigrant sentiment in Germany. LAGODINSKY: It is a great feeling to - now to campaign for European Parliament in the cities and towns where I used to live in a refugee shelter. It's kind of mind-blowing. And I want to make it possible for others. KIM: On this evening, Lagodinsky is in central Berlin for a campaign event. UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #1: (Foreign language spoken). KIM: About 50 people of all ages have packed a cafe, some nursing beers and red wine. (APPLAUSE) LAGODINSKY: (Foreign language spoken). KIM: Lagodinsky is preaching to the choir, to Green Party members like 26-year-old Liliann Fischer. LILIANN FISCHER: There is no way that I can imagine my own future or Germany's future without the EU there as a sort of context or framework. KIM: The pro-EU Greens, once a left-wing fringe party, are now polling in second place in Germany. They're expected to get up to a fifth of the vote, behind Chancellor Angela Merkel's Christian Democrats. Another once-fringe party has appeared on the right, throwing overboard German taboos on nationalism. It's the AFD, or Alternative for Germany Party. I caught up with one of its candidates, Nicolaus Fest, in Berlin. NICOLAUS FEST: We want to stop becoming Europe United Nations of European countries. We want to have strong nation-states which work closely together. But each country should decide on their own what is best for them, and we don't want to have everything decided in Brussels. KIM: That kind of sentiment is expected to give the AFD more than 10% of the vote. Fest says it's no contradiction to run for office in the European Parliament because he wants to change the EU from inside and have a Brexit-style referendum in Germany in the next decade. To make sure German support for the EU continues, the European Parliament runs an information center just around the corner from the Brandenburg Gate. UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #2: (Foreign language spoken). (SOUNDBITE OF BELL) KIM: Here, college students are participating in a mock session of the European Parliament. UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #3: (Foreign language spoken). (LAUGHTER) KIM: Rike Feindt is one of them. RIKE FEINDT: It's so important that young people get their voices heard and not just the old people decide everything. KIM: She says she'll definitely vote on Sunday. Lucian Kim, NPR News, Berlin.

            "article_content": "India wants to grant citizenship to refugees from nearby countries \u2014 unless they're Muslim. Critics say making religion a criteria for citizenship violates India's secular character.  MICHEL MARTIN, HOST: This past week, we've been bringing you a series of stories from India about what some people call Hindu pride and others call Hindu nationalism. It's central to Prime Minister Narendra Modi's vision for his country as he runs for re-election. His government has proposed new rules to redefine who is or who can become an Indian citizen. The criteria include religion for the first time. NPR's Lauren Frayer reports. LAUREN FRAYER, BYLINE: Tobiron Nessa washes dishes under an outdoor pump between rice paddies, a stone's throw from where she was born in northeast India. She married a local man and had five children. At 45, she's about to become a grandmother. TOBIRON NESSA: (Speaking Assamese). FRAYER: But Nessa is now the only one in her family whom the Indian government recognizes as a citizen. Her husband and five children have all been left off of the National Register of Citizens, or NRC. It's like a census, but only for this one part of India called Assam, which borders Bangladesh and has always had lots of immigrants from there. Authorities are trying to figure out who's been here for generations and who might be an undocumented migrant. For decades, families have submitted paperwork. But then the party of Prime Minister Narendra Modi came to power and issued a preliminary list of citizens. Four million people who thought they were Indian are not on it, including Nessa's family. NESSA: (Speaking Assamese). FRAYER: She's worried they'll lose their government food rations or get detained and eventually deported. But to where? They have Indian birth certificates, she says, proper documents. AKRAM HUSSAIN: They have proper documents. Still, they have been declared foreigners and thrown to the detention camp. FRAYER: Detention camp? HUSSAIN: Yeah, detention camp. FRAYER: Akram Hussain is an activist who visits detainees. Hundreds of people are being held in camps here. He helps them file appeals. The majority of them are Muslim. Like the U.S.-Mexico border, tribunals and detention centers have been set up here. And like the Trump administration, India's ruling party says Islamist terrorists are trying to infiltrate these borders. (SOUNDBITE OF RALLY) AMIT SHAH: (Speaking Assamese). FRAYER: At an election rally this month, the president of the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party, or BJP, Amit Shah, warned against migrants crossing into India from Muslim majority Bangladesh. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) SHAH: (Through interpreter) These infiltrators are eating away at our country like termites. The NRC is our means of removing them. FRAYER: Until now, the NRC, the National Register of Citizens, has only been carried out in the northeast state of Assam, where there are a lot of immigrants. But Shah says he wants to extend it to the entire nation, make every Indian citizen prove her origin. In this part of Assam, up to a third of residents have been struck from the citizenship register. In a municipal office, workers stamp reams upon reams of appeals. It's difficult for people like Nessa, who is poor and illiterate, to sort through decades-old family documents. Officials acknowledge there are errors, and they do allow time for appeals. All of this is happening in a corner of India that's actually been celebrated for its diversity. (SOUNDBITE OF BICYCLE BELL RINGING) FRAYER: It's a tangle of bicycle rickshaws and vegetable sellers here in Guwahati, one of the biggest cities in the northeast of India. In the marketplace, the language you mostly hear is Assamese. But you hear it spoken in a lot of different accents. PRAFULLA KUMAR MAHANTA: Assam is like a mini India. FRAYER: A mini India is how former Chief Minister Prafulla Kumar Mahanta describes his state of Assam, with all of its ethnic and religious diversity. More than 1 in 3 people here is Muslim. Two neighboring states are more than 80 percent Christian. There are Buddhists, Sikhs and tribal people. Many outsiders have learned the local language. But this diversity may pose a challenge to Modi's vision for a distinctly Hindu country. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) PRIME MINISTER NARENDRA MODI: (Foreign language spoken). FRAYER: In a recent visit to Assam, Modi talked about Mother India being a homeland for Hindus everywhere. He's proposed a Citizenship Amendment Bill, which would grant Indian nationality to anyone who's persecuted in a neighboring country - except if they're Muslim. He went on to explain why. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) MODI: (Foreign language spoken). FRAYER: When India got its independence from Britain in 1947, it was partitioned into Muslim Pakistan, and later Bangladesh, and secular India. Muslims have homelands. Other faiths need India to make room for them. But here's how it looks to many in India's northeast. Local Muslims are losing their citizenship. And at the same time, the government wants to give passports to lots of non-Muslims who may never have set foot in India. Both of those things cut the number of Indian Muslims, says Milan Vaishnav at the Carnegie Endowment in Washington, D.C. MILAN VAISHNAV: I think this is quite telling about who they see as ultimately finding a place in this kind of new proudly Hindu India. FRAYER: There is another country that uses religion as a criteria for citizenship - Israel. Human rights lawyer Aman Wadud says Modi and other Hindu nationalists may see the Jewish state as a model. AMAN WADUD: He thinks that India should be a natural country for Hindus, which is in contrast to the Constitution of India. The Constitution does not give citizenship based on religion. FRAYER: To become a country like Israel, where citizenship is based on religion, India may have to alter its Constitution or use more subtle techniques, says historian Romila Thapar. ROMILA THAPAR: Jobs, who is to be employed. Control over the media, for example. It is amazing how much the middle class has bought this whole idea of Hindu nationalism without really thinking about it. FRAYER: Thapar says if Modi is re-elected, he'll carry on with a fundamental change in India's character. To that end, Modi's Citizenship Amendment Bill has already passed the lower house of Parliament. It awaits final approval from the equivalent of the Senate after this election.

Kamala Harris, a former prosecutor, says she was \"born realizing the flaws in the criminal justice system.\" The California Democrat is not only seeking to become the first woman to be president, but the first black woman.\n                \n                    \n                    Olivia Sun/NPR\n                    \n                \nhide caption Sen. Kamala Harris, a former prosecutor, says she was \"born realizing the flaws in the criminal justice system.\" The California Democrat is not only seeking to become the first woman to be president, but the first black woman. Updated at 2:46 p.m. ET California Sen. Kamala Harris says she was bent toward a career fighting for civil rights almost since birth. The Democrat is the daughter of an Indian mother and a Jamaican father who met at the University of California, Berkeley, and were active in the movement during the 1960s. \"I was born realizing the flaws in the criminal justice system,\" she told NPR's Steve Inskeep. Inspired by Supreme Court Justice Thurgood Marshall, the first African-American to sit on the nation's highest court, she pursued a career in law to help right the wrongs she saw. That ambition would eventually take her from the San Francisco district attorney's office to the California attorney general's office to the Senate. Now she hopes it will take her to the White House. She's seeking to not only become the first woman to be president, but the first black woman. Addressing inequality is a top priority for her. That includes her LIFT the Middle Class Act, a tax cut plan that would give families making less than $100,000 annually a credit of up to $500 a month, saying that \"when we lift up the economic status of families, neighborhoods thrive, society thrives. All of us benefit.\" She is also taking on the controversial idea of reparations, which would provide a form of compensation to those harmed by past discrimination, such as slavery and Jim Crow. Harris is the second 2020 presidential candidate NPR's Morning Edition has interviewed for its Opening Arguments conversations exploring presidential hopefuls' central messages. The first was Sen. Cory Booker of New Jersey. Inskeep interviewed Harris about her time as California attorney general, her views on immigration, criminal justice issues and more. \"Now let me tell you again about my background as a prosecutor. That includes having sat down with children who have dealt with the worst of crimes that you can imagine and understanding that you can never prove their cases until you spend a significant amount of time with them, so that they trust you as an adult [whom] they don't know to tell their story, OK? People in Washington were saying, 'Expedite these cases, get them done in two weeks.' For children who \u2014 I will never forget the images \u2014 who were sitting on a chair, their feet were dangling. That's how small they were. And we were going to expedite these cases to have them tell a perfect stranger in a language or a dialect they don't speak about the trauma that they were experiencing in their home country, which required them to seek refuge in ours. ... \"In fact, my first bill in the United States Senate was Access to Counsel Act to ensure that none of the people \u2014 and then that was also the Muslim refugees after the Muslim ban \u2014 to make sure that nobody would be denied access to counsel when they're going through these hearings around refugee status and around asylum. ... \"I disagree with any policy that would turn America's back on people who are fleeing harm. I frankly believe that it is contrary to everything that we have symbolically and actually said we stand for. And so I would not enforce a law that would reject people and turn them away without giving them a fair and due process to determine if we should give them asylum and refuge.\" Harris draws directly on her personal experiences in California in explaining her approach to immigration. Her focus contrasts with the criminality often emphasized by President Trump. She told NPR, for example, about children she met on a bus in Marietta, Calif. \u2014 unaccompanied minors who had been sent by their parents away from high-crime areas in Central America, who were being \"exposed to unknown perils, [but] their parents decided that was better than them staying where they were. So that tells you how bad it was where they were.\" Her use of the phrase \"would not enforce a law\" is prime for Republican criticism. Yet immigrant rights advocates have argued the administration's policies violate international human rights law, including a program that forces asylum-seekers to wait in Mexico for their assigned court dates in the U.S. \"If we start to examine what have been the outcomes of the history of slavery and legal segregation and discrimination, you can look at the fact \u2014 and anyone can tell you who's a mental health specialist \u2014 that when people have experienced trauma, and it has been undiagnosed and untreated, you will see certain public health outcomes. And so if you recognize the trauma that existed, and we want to end what are avoidable health outcomes, you need to put resources \u2014 and direct resources, extra resources \u2014 into those communities that have experienced that trauma. ... \"The term 'reparations,' it means different things to different people. But what I mean by it is that we need to study the effects of generations of discrimination and institutional racism and determine what have been ... the consequences and what can be done in terms of intervention to correct course.\" The issue of reparations is one that Democratic candidates have embraced so far this cycle, generally pitching policies that aim to address economic inequality. In this interview, though, Harris emphasizes a disparity in health outcomes that she attributes to \"environmental\" rather than genetic factors. \"It is centuries of slavery \u2014 violence associated with slavery,\" Harris said. \"There was never any real intervention to break up what had been generations of people experiencing the highest forms of trauma, and trauma undiagnosed and untreated leads to physiological outcomes.\" Inskeep: Is there a federal equivalent [to California's moratorium on the death penalty] that you would do? Federal executions, of course, are quite rare.Harris: Yes, I think that there should be.Inskeep: A moratorium, an end.Harris: Yes I do, I do believe that.Harris: No one would be executed if you were president of the United States, for any crime.Harris: Correct, correct.Inskeep: Not even, I don't know, treason.Harris: Not in the United States, no. Harris here takes a page from Democratic California Gov. Gavin Newsom, who recently announced a moratorium on the death penalty in his state, saying it was a \"personal\" and \"moral\" issue for him. Harris takes Newsom's decision a step further by applying it to the whole country, telling Inskeep that if she were president, no one would be executed in the U.S. for any crime \u2014 not even treason. She adds, though, \"I absolutely and strongly believe there should be serious and swift consequence when one human being kills another human being. ... I am unequivocal in that belief. So let's be very clear about that. There should be justice.\" The former California attorney general often touts her prosecutorial background as an asset, which could appeal to independents, but she's already faced backlash from some within the Democratic Party about her record. An analysis from Vox found that while she did support programs helping people find jobs instead of sending them to prison, she \"also fought to keep people in prison even after they were proved innocent. She refused to pursue the death penalty against a man who killed a police officer, but also defended California's death penalty system in court. She implemented training programs to address police officers' racial biases, but also resisted calls to get her office to investigate certain police shootings.\" She tells NPR that it's a \"false choice\" to suggest that someone is either tough on crime or soft on crime. Instead, she argues, people should be \"smart on crime,\" pointing to public health as a model. \"If you want to deal with an epidemic \u2014 crime or health \u2014 the smartest and most effective and cheapest way to deal with it is prevention first,\" she says. \"If you're dealing with it in the emergency room or the prison system, it is too late and it is too expensive. We have to be smart on crime.\" \"So I decided to take this issue on from a perspective of not wanting to have to prosecute those kids later in their life. So the issue that I took on it was to put a spotlight of your public safety on the issue of the education of these children, to hopefully get you to prioritize their education and to say, 'Let's put all the resources possible into making sure that they are in school.' And I'll tell you frankly the other reason was to put a spotlight on the fact that the school districts and the people who had a responsibility to make sure these kids weren't getting all of the resources they needed, to put a spotlight on the fact that that wasn't happening and it needed to happen. \"And as a result of our initiative, which never resulted in any parent going to jail \u2014 never \u2014 because that was never the goal, we improved attendance by over 30 percent. ... And it was because we got more services for these kids, and we put a spotlight on the fact that transportation was a big issue for some parents \u2014 just getting their child to school. We learned that, you know, if a parent is working two jobs and they've got a 7-year-old and then the 2-year-old gets sick, they might say to the 7-year-old, 'Stay home and take care of the 2-year-old,' because having child care, you know, and paying for that extra day is going to be too difficult. It was things like that. ... \"Nobody went to jail, and hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of families went through our program, which was a program of getting greater resources to them so the child could be in school every day. The goal was for these children to be in school every day. The youngest of our children, who were missing critical days of their education that they could never make up. That was always the goal, and that was the goal that we achieved.\" This is another part of Harris's record as California attorney general that recently came under scrutiny after a video surfaced of her defending her decision to crack down on truancy. \"I believe a child going without an education is tantamount to a crime,\" she says in the 2010 video. \"So I decided I was going to start prosecuting parents for truancy.\" In her interview with Inskeep, Harris tries to put that decision in context, making the argument that her crackdown actually highlighted the problem of child care for many parents and that they were able to access resources to help them meet their needs.

Income inequality and disparities in access to resources are factors that pose serious threats to human rights across the globe and have already sparked violent protests in some countries, a top United Nations official said Wednesday. Speaking in Geneva, U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights Michelle Bachelet referred to recent protests in Sudan, Haiti and France as examples of how disparities \"in income, wealth, access to resources and access to justice constitute fundamental challenges to the principles of equality, dignity and human rights for every human being.\" Yellow vest protesters marched in Paris last month.\n                \n                    \n                    Thibault Camus/AP\n                    \n                \nhide caption Yellow vest protesters marched in Paris last month. Bachelet blamed poor governance for those problems. She also warned against the \"existential threat\" of xenophobia and called on Saudi Arabia to release women's rights activists. Protests erupted in Sudan in December over cuts in subsidies to fuel and bread. They quickly morphed into calls for Sudanese President Omar al-Bashir to step down. \"In Sudan, for the past several months, people protesting harsh economic conditions and bad governance have been violently dispersed by security forces, sometimes using live ammunition,\" Bachelet said. She also pointed to Venezuela, where \"violations of civil and political rights \u2014 including failure to uphold fundamental freedoms, and the independence of key institutions \u2014 can accentuate a decline of economic and social rights.\" Venezuelans have struggled to access basic necessities as President Nicol\u00e1s  Maduro has blocked aid into the country amid his struggle for power against opposition leader Juan Guaid\u00f3. Guaid\u00f3 declared himself interim president weeks after Maduro was sworn into office for a second term. Maduro's re-election was mired in allegations of fraud. That, compounded with hyperinflation and food shortages, sparked mass protests. Bachelet also used her speech to criticize Israel's blockade of Gaza and its dismissal of a U.N. report that found Israeli soldiers may have committed war crimes in their response to Palestinian protests on the border with Gaza last year, during which 189 Palestinians were killed. Israel's Foreign Minister Israel Katz called the report hostile and biased. FM Israel Katz on @UN_HRC report: The Human Rights Council's Theatre of the Absurd has once again produced a report that is hostile, mendacious and biased against Israel. The U.N. leader called on \"all parties to exercise restraint\" ahead of the March 30 anniversary of last year's protest movement.",

German Chancellor Angela Merkel is not known for being a passionate speaker, touting big ideas or earnest promises. Her personality type would not make her a great candidate for, say, president of the United States. \"She's not a charismatic type,\" says Stefan Kornelius, who has written a biography about Merkel. But \"[German] people don't want to have the visionary thing and being led with flying flags. They just want to have predictability and the guarantee that things are calm and under control, and she gave that guarantee for pretty much all of her rule.\" Germany's chancellor since 2005, Merkel says she won't seek reelection in 2021 and has already stepped down as leader of the center-right Christian Democratic Union Party. Looking back at her long tenure, the past decade has particularly tested her leadership over the European Union's largest economy. It kicked off with a global financial crisis that threatened to break up the EU. Then by mid-decade, Russia's intervention in Ukraine and a historic influx of refugees, and later, a surge of populist movements across Europe further challenged the continent's cohesion. \"She kept a steady hand during a tumultuous time,\" Kornelius says. And her approach is unlike most other democratic leaders. The 65-year-old chancellor \"is probably the least alpha-male type of policymaker that you can imagine,\" says Josef Janning, a former senior policy fellow at the European Council on Foreign Relations. \"She was not so much after providing strong personal leadership, but rather providing a working environment, which helps to articulate positions, negotiate and arrive at some common compromise outcome.\" This pragmatic deal-making was crucial at the start of the decade, as the American financial crisis was spreading globally, threatening to divide the eurozone. Greece's economy was falling apart, with high unemployment and violent street protests in Athens. By 2015, the country had already been bailed out twice \u2014 to the tune of a quarter of a trillion dollars \u2014 and was once again on the verge of bringing back its old currency and breaking with the eurozone. Merkel feared that if one EU member left, others would follow. The EU bailed Greece out once again, the bloc held together and Greece exited the bailout program three years later, able to borrow normally again after years of austerity measures. Over the years, \"Merkel's approach was to do whatever it takes to prevent the EU from falling apart,\" says Janning. \"She has been remarkably successful because there were severe crises, there were profound challenges to the integrity and to the coherence of the EU and it survived.\" Among the tough decisions she's made in the past decade: phasing out nuclear power after Japan's Fukushima disaster, standing up to Russian President Vladimir Putin when he annexed Crimea from Ukraine and allowing more than a million war refugees from Syria to resettle in Germany. Janning says many of these decisions didn't go far enough. After the Greek debt crisis, Merkel could have pushed to strengthen EU fiscal authority over member states, but she didn't. In the wake of the refugee crisis, she could have fought harder to establish a common EU immigration and asylum legislation, agency and border police, but that eluded her as well. Constanze Stelzenm\u00fcller, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution, says Merkel's hallmark style of solving problems through compromise \u2014 always choosing a middle path \u2014 may have prevented lasting solutions to Europe's biggest problems. \"Merkel, like [President Bill] Clinton \u2014 and I think in this she imitated Clinton \u2014 espoused a kind of technocratic, 'there is no alternative' centrism that took the belief, the identity factor out of politics or rather pushed it to the sidelines where it was taken up by the extremists,\" she says. Those extremists are gaining ground, Stelzenm\u00fcller warns. The right-wing populist Alternative for Germany party has become a powerful force in much of the country, while other EU countries are now run by populist leaders who see Merkel's leadership as outdated. \"They reject this ultra-pragmatic bargaining approach and rather create disruption by breaking with the rules,\" says Janning, \"breaking with the establishment, breaking with the institutions of the parties in their own countries, and rather concentrating a lot of power on themselves and on a leadership circle around them.\" And these threats to democracy are precisely why Merkel has been a crucial leader in the past decade, argues Kornelius. \"She will stand as an example on how democracy lives from compromise, from finding the middle ground, from not overreaching, and definitely not from arousing people wherever you stand and go,\" he says. Merkel's biggest achievement, Kornelius says, \"might be that she keeps up the flame of a liberal-minded democracy at a time when the foundation of our democracies are shaken, when we are questioning whether this kind of rule, this kind of government, is the right one for us; while populists all over the world rise and where the West as a unifying ideal of so many countries with the U.S. at its helm is collapsing.\"",

The de facto leader of Myanmar, Aung San Suu Kyi, listened quietly in the audience of the United Nation's high court on Tuesday, as lawyers recounted the mass killing, rape and torture of Myanmar's Muslim minority Rohingya. But on Wednesday, Suu Kyi had her turn at the microphone, where she vigorously defended her country's government against accusations of genocide. \"The situation in Rakhine state is complex and not easy to fathom,\" she told a 17-judge panel of the International Court of Justice in The Hague, referring to the region where the brutal crackdown carried out by Myanmar's military has been centered. This week, the International Court of Justice is considering whether to grant a provisional measure aimed at protecting Rohingya still living in Myanmar's Rakhine state. The tiny Muslim-majority nation of Gambia brought the case against Myanmar, which is accused of violating the 1948 convention against genocide. The ICJ has in the past confirmed that all member states have the duty to prevent genocide. The U.N. estimates that 10,000 Rohingya have been killed in the crackdown. Suu Kyi, a Nobel laureate once lauded as a defender of human rights, has faced mounting criticism that she stood by as nearly a million Rohingya were forced to flee to neighboring Bangladesh. She is one of the first national leaders to respond to a claim directly before the court. Under the International Court of Justice's immense stained-glass windows and intricate chandeliers, Suu Kyi told the panel of judges that Myanmar's military was merely dealing with an internal armed conflict when soldiers responded to \"coordinated and comprehensive attacks\" by militants in the region. Suu Kyi says a 2016 attack on local police by the Arakan Rohingya Salvation Army, a militant group, triggered the response by Myanmar's military. \"It cannot be ruled out that disproportionate force was used by members of the defense services in some cases, in disregard of international humanitarian law, or that they did not distinguish clearly enough between ARSA fighters and civilians,\" she told the court. Suu Kyi argued that Gambia does not have enough evidence to lodge charges of genocide and pledged that anyone who committed war crimes would be held accountable through Myanmar's own military justice system. \"Please bear in mind this complex situation and the challenge to sovereignty and security in our country when you are assessing the intent of those who attempted to deal with the rebellion,\" she said. \"Surely, under the circumstances, genocidal intent cannot be the only hypothesis.\" She continued: \"There will be no tolerance of human rights violations in Rakhine or elsewhere in Myanmar. No stone has been left unturned to make domestic accountability work.\" Judges in The Hague open the second day of hearings in the case alleging genocide by Myanmar.\n                \n                    \n                    Peter Dejong/AP\n                    \n                \nhide caption Judges in The Hague open the second day of hearings in the case alleging genocide by Myanmar. Suu Kyi's assessment of what happened in Rakhine state contrasted starkly with the case made by Gambia a day earlier. Lawyers and experts representing the West African nation described victims being forced inside houses that were intentionally set on fire; soldiers specifically targeting children, including infants and babies; and satellite images showing an entire Rohingya village destroyed, while a nearby non-Rohingya village was left untouched. Gambia's justice minister, Abubacarr Marie Tambadou, who spent more than a decade prosecuting cases related to Rwanda's 1994 genocide and is one of the officials presenting Gambia's case, told the court that he visited Rohingya refuge camps in Bangladesh in 2018. \"When I looked into the eyes of those refugees as they recounted their devastating stories, I could see the looks of fear, of despair, of desperation, and of destruction,\" he told the court. \"The looks of victims of a modern-day genocide. And so we asked the question WHY? Why is the world standing by and allowing such horrors again in our lifetime?\" Human rights groups swiftly condemned Suu Kyi's testimony. \"The exodus of more than three quarters of a million people from their homes and country was nothing but the result of an orchestrated campaign of murder, rape and terror,\" Amnesty International wrote in a statement. \"To suggest that the military 'did not distinguish clearly enough between fighters and civilians' defies belief,\" Amnesty said. \"Likewise, the suggestion that Myanmar authorities can currently and independently investigate and prosecute those suspected of crimes under international law is nothing but a fantasy, in particular in the case of senior military perpetrators who have enjoyed decades of total impunity.\" As NPR's Michael Sullivan has reported, Suu Kyi's unprecedented appearance before the International Court of Justice is likely aimed in part at shoring up domestic support ahead of elections next year. Crowds of well-wishers waving \"We Stand With Our Leader\" signs cheered Suu Kyi as she left Myanmar for the Netherlands over the weekend.

In Myanmar, Rohingya watched livestreams of the hearing on smartphones, The Washington Post reported. \"The government has no shame,\" 23 year-old Ro Nur Deen told the Post. \"They have no transparency and no accountability, but finally, we are excited that the world can see the truth at the ICJ.\" Gambia's legal team told the court that after the crackdown that forced so many to cross the border, an estimated 600,000 Rohingya remain in Myanmar, citing a recent U.N. fact-finding mission that concluded they \"remain under serious risk of genocide.\" If the judges side with Gambia, the court would order Myanmar to immediately \"take all measures within its power to prevent all acts that amount to or contribute to the crime of genocide.\" A decision is expected within weeks or months, while a formal ruling of whether Myanmar committed genocide could take years. \"You are called upon to act now,\" Philippe Sands, a specialist in international law and a member of Gambia's legal team, told the court. \"This court is the ultimate guardian of the Genocide Convention,\" he told the court. \"It is on you that the eyes of the world are turned.\"",

Aung San Suu Kyi, the de facto leader of Myanmar, will testify in front of the International Court of Justice on Wednesday, where she's set to mount a defense on behalf of her country to charges of genocide against minority Muslim Rohingya. Suu Kyi, a Nobel Peace Prize laureate and former longtime political prisoner, was once viewed globally as a champion of democracy and human rights. However, she is accused of standing by as Myanmar's military carried out a brutal crackdown on the Rohingya beginning in 2016, causing an estimated 700,000 people to flee to neighboring Bangladesh. The organizers of a 2018 fact-finding mission told the United Nations that 10,000 Rohingya deaths would be a \"conservative estimate.\" Despite Myanmar's transition to civilian leadership, the military still holds significant power. Suu Kyi led her National League for Democracy party to a landslide victory in 2015. Her formal title is \"state counsellor,\" a position she created to skirt a provision in Myanmar's constitution that bars anyone with foreign children or a foreign spouse from holding the presidency. The constitution also dictates a power-sharing agreement that ensures Myanmar's armed forces control a quarter of the seats in parliament and three top cabinet posts. At The Hague this week, Suu Kyi will lead a delegation aimed at countering allegations of genocide against her country's military. It's a rare appearance of a national leader before the United Nations' principal judicial organ, but one that analysts say plays well for Suu Kyi in Myanmar, where she faces an election next year and needs to solidify domestic support. Thousands gathered in Myanmar on Sunday to cheer Suu Kyi as she prepared to leave for the Netherlands. Throngs of people waved flags and hoisted colorful Suu Kyi portraits and signs saying, \"We stand with our leader.\" David Mathieson, an independent analyst in Yangon, says for much of Myanmar, the reaction to Suu Kyi's decision to personally appear at The Hague was one of \"shock.\" \"I think it was one of 'good on Mother Suu for sticking up for our country and confronting what many see as these unjust charges,'\" Mathieson says. About 700 people rallied Dec. 1 in Yangon to show support for Myanmar's leader, Aung San Suu Kyi, as she prepares to defend the country against charges of genocide at the U.N.'s highest court.\n                \n                    \n                    Thein Zaw/AP\n                    \n                \nhide caption About 700 people rallied Dec. 1 in Yangon to show support for Myanmar's leader, Aung San Suu Kyi, as she prepares to defend the country against charges of genocide at the U.N.'s highest court. The case against Myanmar was filed by Gambia, backed by the 57-member Organization of Islamic Cooperation. Gambia claims that Myanmar's military carried out rape, torture and killing in Rohingya communities \u2014 a violation of the 1948 Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide. Back in November, a three-judge panel of the International Criminal Court, which prosecutes individuals, concluded that there is \"reasonable basis to believe widespread and/or systematic acts of violence may have been committed that could qualify as the crimes against humanity of deportation across the Myanmar-Bangladesh border and persecution on grounds of ethnicity and/or religion against the Rohingya population.\" As NPR's Jason Beaubien has reported: In 2017, after an armed Rohingya separatist group attacked a police station, Myanmar soldiers and pro-government militias launched what the U.N. and human rights groups have denounced as a campaign of ethnic cleansing against the Rohingya. Entire villages were burned to the ground. Thousands were killed. Myanmar officials say the violence was a security operation targeting terrorists, and the Rohingya refugees are welcome to come home. Myanmar has refused to allow United Nations investigators or international journalists into the country to investigate the alleged massacres. It has jailed two Myanmar reporters who were investigating the killing of Rohingya Muslims for Reuters. \"I think she genuinely believes what happened in 2016, 2017 was not genocide,\" author and former diplomat Thant Myint-U tells NPR's Michael Sullivan. \"I think she genuinely feels a great anger at what she sees is an unfair response from the outside world.\" Suu Kyi, he says, \"genuinely wants to have literally her day in court and I think she genuinely believes that there can be no one better to represent the country at this time.\" Matthew Smith, executive director of the human rights organization Fortify Rights, tells NPR that he expects Suu Kyi to make the same defense she's been making for months now: \"Denying that the crime of genocide took place, alleging or pointing, trying to shift attention to crimes that were perpetrated by Rohingya militants. And really trying to paint a picture of a situation in which it is the state dealing with Islamic terrorist threats.\" Mathieson, the Yangon-based independent analyst, says that will be a difficult case to make, given extensive documentation by a U.N. fact-finding mission and research by groups like Amnesty International. But Human Rights Watch Deputy Asia Director Phil Robertson says he's hopeful about the prospect of accountability in Myanmar, as long as accountability for the alleged atrocities reaches Suu Kyi. \"The reality is, she's thrown in with the generals, she's part and parcel of the atrocities against the Rohingya and nothing's going to change that,\" he tells NPR. \"If she's going to be leader of the cover-up, certainly there needs to be some action taken against her on that.\"",

She's headed there to defend her country against charges of genocide against the Muslim minority Rohingya. Seven-hundred thousand refugees fled a brutal crackdown by Myanmar's military in 2017.

But, says author and former diplomat Thant Myint-U, Suu Kyi's trip to The Hague is about more than posturing for an upcoming election. THANT MYINT-U: I think she genuinely believes what happened in 2016/2017 was not genocide. I think she genuinely feels a great anger at what she sees as an unfair response from the outside world. I think she genuinely wants to have literally her day in court. And I think she genuinely believes that there could be no one better to represent the country at this time. SULLIVAN: If all of that is true, Matthew Smith of Fortify Rights expects to hear the same arguments from Suu Kyi at The Hague that she's been making for years now. SMITH: Denying that the crime of genocide took place, alleging or trying to shift attention to crimes that were perpetrated by Rohingya militants and really trying to paint a picture of a situation in which it is the state dealing with Islamic terrorist threats. SULLIVAN: And that, independent analyst David Mathieson says, will be a hard sell, given the government's stonewalling in the past. MATHIESON: The fact is she's responding to this one while having wholesale dismissed the U.N. fact-finding mission, the U.N. special rapporteur, Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch that have done incredibly exhaustive documentation, augmented by satellite photos to prove that something utterly horrific happened. And that's why I think it will ultimately be a farce. SULLIVAN: Not everyone agrees. KINGSLEY ABBOTT: There is hope for justice. SULLIVAN: Kingsley Abbott is a senior legal adviser with the International Commission of Jurists, reached via Skype. Just a few years ago, he says, the prospect of accountability for Myanmar looked bleak. But today, he says, there are several cases underway. ABBOTT: International justice always takes time. But now the situation is quite different than it was two years ago. And things can change; regimes can change. But I think, certainly, people need to buckle in for a long ride where their expectations are tempted but they remain hopeful. SULLIVAN: Phil Robertson of Human Rights Watch is hopeful, too, if accountability for the alleged atrocities reaches Suu Kyi. ROBERTSON: The reality is that she has thrown in with the generals. She is part and parcel of the cover-up of the atrocities against the Rohingya. And nothing's going to change that. If she is going to be the leader of the cover-up, there's certainly some action that has to be taken against her on that. SULLIVAN: For NPR News, I'm Michael Sullivan in Bangkok.

            "article_content": "Greta Thunberg did not sail across the Atlantic Ocean for two weeks to become a lead singer. But, just days after the 16-year-old proselytizer censured a room of world leaders many times her age for their shared \"fairy tales of eternal economic growth,\" the internet made her one, anyway. The most impassioned moments of Thunberg's September sermon at the United Nations quickly sprouted musical memes. In New York, a drummer growled her words above relentless Swedish death metal, a nod to her homeland that doubled as a fundraising blunderbuss for Greenpeace. Two producers turned the speech into bombastic electronica, with roaring choirs and stomping boots set to scenes of forests burning and children marching. And another mashed the day's cri de c\u0153ur\u2014\"Right here, right now is where we draw the line.\"\u2014with the Fatboy Slim hit \"Right Here, Right Now.\" Just days later, Slim himself slipped it into a live set, sending his audience into a tizzy. Environmentalism in music is nothing new, of course. A full quarter-century before James Hansen told Congress that humans were changing their climate, Peter La Farge, an indigenous songwriter from the Southwest, repeatedly warned of environmental devastation on 1963's As Long as the Grass Shall Grow, a remarkable album of Native American laments about the various plagues of pioneers. From Joni Mitchell singing of the birds, bees and DDT to Neil Young rhapsodizing of \"Mother Earth / and her healing ways\" in 1990 (or grousing about \"old white guys trying to kill mother nature\" in 2019), the stars of the '60s and '70s have often stepped into a post-Silent Spring fray. It's never stopped, really: Depeche Mode sang of forests dying and streams putrefying in 1983, presciently alluding to climate-science deniers. One of Dave Matthews' earliest songs, \"One Sweet World,\" inspired a Ben & Jerry's flavor that has raised tens of thousands of dollars for an environmental coalition. There are entire milieus of metal and punk devoted to socioecological unsustainability, realms where nuclear weapons and animal agriculture share culpability. On her second album, Miley Cyrus wrote a rock song about \"going green,\" while Anohni sardonically longed for it all to burn \u2014 \"dogs crying for water... fish go belly-up in the sea\" \u2014 above demonic horns and militant drums on \"4 Degrees.\" Mos Def has rapped about the money-hungry ruining the water supply. And even Smash Mouth tried to alarm us about the corroding ozone layer and melting ice shelf during \"All Star,\" that song from Shrek. Thunberg's unlikely ascendance as a source of inspiring samples highlights something that's missing: a song that helps us sort through our globally mounting anxiety about climate change and our role in our own potential doom, an actual anthem that propels people towards action. Despite its news-cycle ubiquity and increasing threat of globe-altering impacts, songs touching on climate change have rarely crossed the threshold of the mainstream, existing instead as a distant flicker on the radar of our collective awareness. \"Big Yellow Taxi,\" perhaps as close as we've gotten to a unifying environmental ode, turns 50 next year; it's been so ubiquitous for so long it feels as pat as an advertising jingle. In the last few years, however, global warming and the intense feelings it fosters have begun to creep subtly into lyrics where you may overlook them, a quiet corollary to a movement spider-webbing through electronic music. Songwriters are increasingly treating climate unease like the very air we breathe or the technology we use \u2014 a part of life with which we must reckon and reconcile, like love or lust or loss. These new tunes aren't protest songs as we think of them, and they don't shoehorn motivational slogans into their choruses; they are reflections of a reality lived under the specter of global collapse, the evidence of our personal adjustments to an anxiously indeterminate present and future. And their writers, unlike Thunberg, aren't looking to proselytize to world leaders or to synthesize scientific research into an empowering single \u2014 they're not the experts, after all. They're just people offering others a way to sort through what's happening, even to mourn what's already been lost. It's the difference between a command and a confession, a lecture and a conversation. \"We're afraid of darkness. We're afraid of endings. We're afraid of death,\" says Tamara Lindeman, a Canadian singer whose work as The Weather Station has started to integrate snippets of impending disaster into her songs. Her next album, due in 2020, commits to the subject. \"To look at something so profoundly devastating is so scary, but it's powerful if you can allow yourself to feel those feelings. You can stop hiding from it. Having that experience through art is healthy.\" Natalie Mering, who records as Weyes Blood, photographed in 2019. Her acclaimed album Titanic Rising deals, in part, with the climate crisis.\n                \n                    \n                    Eliot Lee Hazel/Courtesy of Sub Pop\n                    \n                \nhide caption Some of these newer songs confront global warming like a mammoth sparring partner, squaring up to the subject wielding rhetoric like fists. Andrew Bird's \"Manifest\" sounds as breezy as a Sunday stroll through the Laurel Canyon, with licks of whistling and gliding strings. But in the first verse, he renounces the United States' westward sprawl, condemning a country of unfaithful stewards. He gazes at the ocean with anxiety and ponders the way we burn ancient organisms \u2014 the fossils in our fossil fuels \u2014 just to drive to the grocery store. During 2016's \"Generation Why,\" Weyes Blood offers her fearful vision like she's reading the evening news: \"It's not the past that scares me / Now what a great future this is gonna be.\" She spells out \"YOLO\" during the hook, her mind caught in the evermore-tight vice between modern indulgence and future existence. Others, though, are almost subliminal in their climate change invocations. Justin Vernon hides his worry in plain sight during Bon Iver's \"Holyfields.\" With his clutched falsetto, he renders \"The dawn is rising / the land ain't rising\" almost as an aside, as if the circumstances of modern Venice and future Mumbai, Bangkok and Miami are so obvious they're best left coded. Lana Del Rey slips her own stark observations into the final verse of \"The Greatest,\" calmly inserting a note about wildfires and eternal heat waves between lines about Kanye West's blond hair and Hawaii's bomb scare. On a song where \"the culture is lit,\" it's a lyrical detail that's easy to miss \u2014 just as it's possible to overlook that, on the album's cover, California is burning. Blake Mills knows that coastline in flames well. Born in Santa Monica and raised in Malibu, the songwriter and star producer, once called \"the last guitarist I heard that I thought was phenomenal\" by Eric Clapton, is conditioned to months of perpetually balmy days, interrupted with occasional downpours as fall slides into winter. But a few years ago that rain was slow to come, and the landscape around Los Angeles felt like a tinderbox. When, at last, storms arrived, a friend joked to Mills that maybe it would be the last rain ever for Los Angeles. The storm's petrichor, Mills remembers, smelled of nostalgia. Hear a snippet of Blake Mill's forthcoming song \"Summer All Over\": Mills sat down at his piano and began to ponder what that might mean. The result \u2014 a sobering, tender ballad called \"Summer All Over\" \u2014 teeters at the threshold of hope and despair. With his sigh caked on the keys like mud at the bottom of some drought-devastated lake, Mills tempers his quiet horror by \"looking for laughter, looking for kindness,\" for any human quality that aims to right our colossal wrongs. Mills captures that seesaw of feelings musically with a pervasive flicker of melodic dissonance. Electronics drift in the background, like smog hovering above a troubled valley. \"Writing about the season of summer inherently evokes a Beach Boys vibe, maybe because I'm in Los Angeles,\" says Mills, who penned the song with Cass McCombs and hopes to release it on his third album. \"But the implication of the warmest season happening all over the world at the same time is an 'endless summer.' \" He notes the sad irony of a term that, less than 50 years ago, belonged to a relatively carefree Beach Boys collection. But \"Summer All Over,\" an enticing title that suggests burnished bodies on a California shoreline, is tragically beautiful, a warm hug from an old ghost. Rock and roll can't be all good times on the bleeding edge of environmental ruin. While touring for the last several years, Kentucky songwriter Joan Shelley came to similar epiphanies along the California coast. Not long ago, she was driving north from Los Angeles to Seattle between shows, marveling at the scenery along California's fabled Highway 1. She remembers the cliffs and the sunlight glittering on the Pacific, a fantasy come to life. That image is captured by \"Stay All Night,\" a seaside reflection from her quietly uneasy 2019 album, Like the River Loves the Sea. She marvels at the vista but, in the final verse of her reverie, wonders how temporary it may be, hoping that \"the waves don't rise this high.\" Actually, it was the opposite: On a recent return visit, that road was closed, nearby cliffs washed into the water by landslides. During the album's arresting centerpiece, \"The Fading,\" Shelley retreats to Kentucky, the place Mark Twain (allegedly) joked he'd like to be when the world ended, because it's always years behind everywhere else. Shelley keys on that idea as she reclines to witness the natural world overrun the order we've imposed upon it. \"I cheered the flood / when the water hit the wall and won,\" she lilts, her cotton-soft voice temporarily stiffening. It's a love song at, and for, the end of time, an exercise in appreciating what you've had the chance to cherish, whether it's a drink of gin or a gentle lover or a lovely day. Sometimes, Shelley admits, she turns off the news, because the devastation is too much to hear. As a songwriter, then, it was paramount to create a new way of approaching that helplessness, of facing those truths. These songs don't protest reality \u2014 they simply acknowledge it. \"With the small rooms I play for, I'm hoping to give people tools for feeling where we may want to be numb. There's a grief that is hard to admit to,\" she says. \"But through art, people can express those low-humming anxieties in a way that isn't so hard to face.\" Will Oldham, who records as Bonny \"Prince\" Billy, photographed in 2019.\n                \n                    \n                    Christian Hansen/Courtesy of Drag City\n                    \n                \nhide caption The sweetly wizened voice trailing Shelley's during \"The Fading\" belongs to fellow Kentucky native Will Oldham. She, in turn, adds harmonies across I Made a Place, Oldham's first record of original music as Bonnie \"Prince\" Billy in eight years. Moments of intense worry and woe linger in the record's quiet corners, absorbing the light of these seemingly incandescent songs. During the album's jaunty first verse, a home burns, part of a personal conflagration that Oldham suggests is spreading. And during the hypnotic \"Nothing Is Busted,\" a wounded woman and an oblivious man capture the dynamic between our ecosystem and our social order, a relationship hamstrung by the need for new things to sell, buy and discard. \"This particular assemblage of molecules and memories someday soon may just run out of gas,\" Oldham sings in one song's closing verse without pausing to take so much as a breath, as if racing against the apocalypse. For most of I Made a Place, Oldham dances around or with these end times. But during \"This Is Far From Over,\" an acoustic stunner near the album's center, he faces them with softness and resolve. Presumably written for his newborn daughter, the song conjures a world where rising tides force her to take to the sea as an adult, a continental refugee who will do her best to persevere. It is a tragic lullaby, a preemptive apology for the mess she will inherit. Despite the title, Oldham is neither blithe nor disingenuous, using the last verse to confront the possibility that new kinds of life will thrive in humanity's absence. \"The whole world's far from over,\" he sings in the final line at the edge of his falsetto, just where his voice might crack into tears. \"Our kids are being handed a rotten deal, everyone's children,\" says The National's Matt Berninger, father to a 10-year-old daughter, Isla. \"The Industrial Revolution gave the Earth a gaping wound not that long ago in the grand scheme, and it's bleeding out fast. But a tipping point is happening, I think, in understanding how rigged that system is.\" The National have rarely been an overtly political band \u2014 Berninger has instead spent two decades mapping the darkest and most dangerous corners of his psyche. He's worried out loud about handing down his worst habits to Isla, about taking love too hard for his own health, and about losing himself in the strange alchemy of lust and blood and booze. But now the peril of climate change has entered that matrix of considerations, part of \"the soup of everyone's minds and hearts all the time,\" as he puts it, alongside sex and drugs and comedy and general dread. Matt Berninger of The National, performing at The Greek Theater on September 25, 2018 in Berkeley, Ca.\n                \n                    \n                    Tim Mosenfelder/Getty Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption In December 2018, Berninger was at a wedding just north of Los Angeles when a song sketch from The National's Aaron Dessner arrived. Berninger woke up one morning before sunset and, while wandering the streets, unspooled 17 verses to the loop, a sort of living chronicle of his consciousness. There were headline anxieties about the alt-right and immigration, opinions about R.E.M. and The Bible, an interest in the seemingly infinite minimalism of artist Hanne Darboven. When he sent the epic to Dessner and filmmaker and producer Mike Mills, they trimmed his diarist sprawl and added an unexpected twist: the dire verses of \"Noble Experiment,\" a waltz for the end of humanity, released by indie-rock eccentrics Thinking Fellers Union 282 in 1994. During the finished version, \"Not in Kansas\" from this year's I Am Easy to Find, a small choir intones those doomed words \u2014 \"Be a fish or a weed or a sparrow / For the Earth has grown tired and all of your time has expired\" \u2014 between Berninger's own verses. The National effectively nest the end of the world inside a laundry list of mundane thoughts; it's like finding your own death certificate in the day's otherwise ordinary mail. The world teems with distractions, \"Not in Kansas\" implies, to keep us from the crisis at the door. \"I don't know how any artist isn't talking about all of this stuff \u2014 sexism, racism, global warming, corporate corruption. I can't spend time on a song now unless it's somehow aware of that stuff,\" Berninger says. \"Art has the responsibility to try to enlighten, instead of just entertain. Pop music is still afraid to get into it, but not everyone.\" Perhaps the closest that recent pop has come to the subject is \"PARAD(w/m)E,\" a slyly sparkling 2018 single from the North Carolina duo Sylvan Esso. The tune is ebullient, with a chorus that sounds like a mechanized schoolyard chant and verses that shimmer like sunshine on the distant desert horizon. It's possible to hear and even sing along without ever reflecting on its apocalyptic scenes \u2014 the gasless gas stations, the flora-less forests, the reprieve-less heat. Singer Amelia Meath laughs ruefully about fans who show up to shows wearing homemade shirts reading \"How's that for manifesting our destiny,\" having misinterpreted the song's linchpin indictment as a self-help mantra fit for yogis. About halfway in, Nick Sanborn's keyboards wobble from their glistening perch, slinking briefly into a morass beneath taunting handclaps. In the refrain, Meath's proclamation of liberation \u2014 \"We finally got free\" \u2014 comes only after she reveals the cause: We've already ruined everything. While \"PARAD(w/m)E\" never landed on Billboard's charts, it suggests a clear framework for some future global-warming protest anthem, much like Billie Eilish's subtly hypnotic \"all the good girls go to hell\": lyrics so sharp listeners might not feel the knife, surrounded by music that celebrates whatever it is we've salvaged. \"No one likes the guy at the party who is just talking about horrible stuff all the time. But that's me,\" says Meath, smiling. She's worked to weave such concerns into Sylvan Esso's third LP, likely arriving in 2020, without being didactic. \"That song is cloaked, very specifically, to be easy to swallow. That is the dream: Make the funnest music about the heaviest shit.\" In Iceland, mourners hold funerals for dead glaciers. In Washington state, a pioneering three-credit course called \"Environmental Grief & Climate Anxiety: Coping in the Age of Consequences\" teaches students how to sort through their despair and identify its sources. (The class subsequently became a Fox News punchline.) And in magazines from Vogue to Vice, recent articles about \"eco-grief\" signal the drift of these fears into the mainstream. Songs about climate change are an inevitable, essential, and overdue component of that movement, a necessary response and tool for people \"to process the truth and the existential dread,\" as Berninger puts it. And while these songs have slowly started to accumulate during the last several years, it seems that we're just at the edge of a new tide of them. Next year, alongside new records from Sylvan Esso and The Weather Station, Grimes \u2014 a fringe pop star who has delighted in dancing at the edge of accessibility for a decade \u2014 will release Miss Anthropocene. \"Each song will be a different embodiment of human extinction,\" she has written. So far, its singles have mined the power dynamics of abusive relationships and the burden of despondency, topics that get to the nuance of the overarching issue. In a presidential election year, when the United States is officially able to exit the Paris Climate Agreement, Grimes likely won't be alone, either in commiserating peers or coping listeners. The British singer-songwriter Bill Fay, now in his late 70s, touches on the topic for Countless Branches, due in January, while buzzy LA producer Shallou cloaks concerns about environmental collapse in breakup imagery on an album due next summer. None of these songwriters work under the illusion that these tunes, however poppy or plainspoken, will literally fix anything, from reversing President Donald Trump's confusing climate-change denial to adjusting people's disposable plastic habits. As working musicians, they have practical issues of their own to navigate, anyway, as the mechanisms of distribution for their work \u2014 be it a server churning through electricity or an LP made with petroleum or a tour bus burning gas \u2014 inextricably entail a carbon footprint for now. Coldplay won't tour behind their recent Everyday Life until they can do so in a carbon-neutral way, a powerful stand from one of the world's biggest bands but a strategy that's not yet sustainable for small acts working merely for their living. It's the essential friction of making and selling art that questions capitalist foundations. But for now, these songs simply exist for the people who need them, their writers included. They're not expressions of what they know or what they want you to do but only how they feel \u2014 and implicit permission slips for you to feel that way, too. \"I'm not hoping to shine a light on something for anybody. Everything that needs to be said is being said really clearly,\" says Mills, referring to scientists and policy experts who know and can articulate what he cannot. \"But my song is about how we're reacting to that information. And despair in music can help soak up the despair of the people listening.\"",

Living quietly in Taiwan are several dozen young Hong Kong protesters who, one night in July, vandalized Hong Kong's legislature during ongoing anti-government protests. Their arrival in Taiwan has revived a fierce debate on the small, self-ruled island over whether it can \u2014 or should \u2014 accept Chinese citizens seeking safety. Taiwan's proximity to mainland China has long made it a desired safe haven for dissidents and other Chinese looking for a better life. In the late 1980s and early 1990s, there were nearly a dozen cases of desperate mainland Chinese citizens hijacking commercial jets and crash-landing them in Taiwan, seeking asylum. Most were imprisoned in Taiwan or sent back to mainland China. Now, as Chinese control grows over Hong Kong, Taiwan is again becoming a destination for political refugees from across greater China \u2014 especially from Hong Kong. Taiwan is treading carefully. It is wary of provoking Beijing's ire, and fears a more permissive refugee policy will open Taiwan's doors to mainland Chinese spies and conspirators. \"China will take advantage of that kind of freedom, liberty and democracy,\" said Luo Chi-cheng, a lawmaker with Taiwan's majority Democratic Progressive Party. \"A democracy like Taiwan has different concerns, sitting next to authoritarian China, than other ordinary democracies.\" Those who do flee to Taiwan often face difficulties. Taiwan has no formal refugee law, so political refugees are unable to work legally. Many of the Hong Kong protesters, who are staying in Taiwan on monthly tourist visas, are so young they have not even graduated from high school \u2014 making them ineligible for longer-term student visas. An informal network of churches and nonprofits supports them financially, and a volunteer group of Taiwanese lawyers has pledged free legal consultation. \"Our hearts are with them\" \"They were not prepared at all. They are so young,\" said Lam Wing Kee, one of five booksellers detained in Hong Kong and spirited into mainland China by Chinese security officers in 2015. All were accused of selling banned political books. Lam is the only bookseller who went public with allegations that he had been abducted, and he refused to be taken back to mainland China. Lam is at the heart of Hong Kong's continuing mass anti-government protests. In April, he left Hong Kong for Taiwan, believing a proposed Hong Kong law might send him back to mainland China. The bill set off the protests roiling Hong Kong, causing Hong Kong leader Carrie Lam to shelve the legislation indefinitely. Even so, Lam is not returning to Hong Kong anytime soon. \"Hong Kong has no rule of law anymore. If I were to return, I need to guarantee I also have the freedom to leave. But I cannot guarantee my personal safety there anymore,\" he told NPR in an interview in Taipei, Taiwan's capital. He has become a mentor to the newest and youngest wave of Hong Kong arrivals, many of whom declined NPR's interview requests. Taiwan's President Tsai Ing-wen and Foreign Minister Joseph Wu have said they support allowing the Hong Kong protesters to stay. \"When we see a very touching story of 1 million people, 2 million people coming out to fight for their freedom and democracy, of course our hearts are with them,\" Wu told NPR. \"If [the protesters] want to stay in Taiwan for a longer period of time, we do have a legal basis for that,\" he says, citing Taiwan's regulations regarding Hong Kong and Macau. These regulations contain a vague provision that allows Taiwan to provide \"necessary assistance\" to residents of Hong Kong or Macau \"whose safety and liberty are immediately threatened for political reasons.\" But critics say the law does not provide implementation details and is not sufficient in providing a pathway toward legal residency for asylum seekers. However, efforts to pass a refugee policy that welcomes all political refugees, including mainland Chinese citizens, remain unpopular. When refugee laws have been proposed, they are voted down. Fears of disruption Supporters of Kuomingtang presidential nominee Han Kuo-yu ready for a campaign rally at a Hakka temple south of Taipei, the capital.\n                \n                    \n                    Emily Feng /NPR\n                    \n                \nhide caption Supporters of Kuomingtang presidential nominee Han Kuo-yu ready for a campaign rally at a Hakka temple south of Taipei, the capital. Opposition to such a policy is rooted in discrimination against mainland Chinese, who are often seen in Taiwan as ill-mannered opportunists. \"Mainland Chinese immigrants are even lazier than [Taiwanese] locals. They come [to Taiwan], and they are useless,\" said Guan Renjian, a newspaper commentator who has written strongly against accepting political refugees. Guan also fears Chinese Communist spies could overwhelm Taiwanese immigration authorities. \"They only have to send 1 million more mainland Chinese over and our democratic values would be disrupted,\" Guan said. \"We need to have strict screening methods for immigrants and especially political refugees.\" Whether to accept mainland Chinese citizens is overshadowed by historical tensions between Taiwan's indigenous residents and those who descend from the 2 million or so Chinese Nationalist soldiers and their supporters who fled to Taiwan in 1949 after losing a civil war to the ruling Chinese Communist Party. Taiwan's Nationalist party, or Kuomintang, confiscated indigenous assets and seized political power in Taiwan, ruling the island under dictatorial martial law until 1987. Freddy Lim, a Taiwanese death-metal rocker turned politician, helped found a political party that has made multiple refugee law proposals, all of which failed.

Now running for reelection as an independent, Lim will no longer firmly commit to supporting such a law. \"A refugee law would be reminiscent of the events in 1949. Many people will say that when Taiwan received all the Nationalists that year, those political refugees mismanaged Taiwan for a long time,\" said Keng-Wei Chang, a Taiwanese financial entrepreneur who wrote a Facebook post criticizing a young mainland Chinese student, Li Jiabao, currently seeking asylum in Taiwan. The post was shared thousands of times. This sort of antipathy has not stopped some mainland Chinese from seeking safe haven in Taiwan. In January, two Chinese dissidents arrived without an entry permit and were stranded in Taipei's international airport for four months before being allowed to enter on \"humanitarian visas\" after an outcry from local activists. In July, a family of six from China's Sichuan province, who had arrived in Taiwan as tourists and overstayed their visas, decided not to return to mainland China, alleging they are part of a persecuted Christian congregation, the Early Rain Covenant Church. Gong Yulian, who served two years of hard labor in China beginning 1994 for supporting mainland China's 1989 democracy movement, has been living in Taiwan since 2015. \"After being released, I was unable to stand the day-to-day monitoring, harassment, intimidation and being invited to 'drink tea' with the Chinese Communist Party,\" said Gong, using a euphemism for being contacted by state security. He arrived in Taiwan while transiting through Taipei on a flight to Japan, but has been told by Taiwanese authorities he does not qualify for Taiwanese residency without a refugee law in place. \"It's not the moment\" Lawmakers from Taiwan's activist New Power Party have repeatedly and unsuccessfully proposed a refugee law \u2014 in 2016, 2017, and most recently, in July. But because it is now election season \u2014 voters will go to the polls in January \u2014 and talk of a refugee policy is even more sensitive, Freddy Lim, a death-metal rocker who helped found the party and is running in 2020 as an independent, will no longer firmly commit to supporting such a law. \"I think it's not the moment, not the right moment, to encourage [Hong Kong protesters] to go into exile,\" he tells NPR, because passing a refugee law \"will be like practically saying that their movement is a failure and ask them to abandon Hong Kong.\" The issue is complicated by a legal twist as well. Under the complex political relationship between mainland China and Taiwan \u2014 China treats Taiwan as if it is part of China \u2014 mainland Chinese citizens are technically citizens of Taiwan, though they lack the rights of Taiwan's residents, such as the right to work and to vote. To accept mainland Chinese formally as refugees would mean disrupting the status quo and calling China and Taiwan two separate countries, a conceptual stance that underpins Taiwan's existence, but one that Beijing and Washington do not agree with. \"The United States and China say if you dare change any of status quo, then it will be seen as a provocation,\" said Wuer Kaixi, who was a student leader in China's 1989 Tiananmen labor and pro-democracy movement. Wuer has called Taiwan home for more than two decades. Like many activists, he sees the prospect of a refugee law for Hong Kong protesters and mainland Chinese dissidents as a sign of pan-Asian, democratic solidarity. \"Today's Hong Kong, tomorrow's Taiwan,\" echoes Fan Yun, one of the island's most respected democracy activists and a sociology professor at National Taipei University. She is also one of the few candidates running for a legislative seat who supports a more concrete refugee law: \"We should fight to protect democracy in Taiwan and to support Hong Kong and their people's fight for their democracy.\" Doing so, she says, \"will help Taiwan.\"",

In the new romantic comedy Last Christmas, Emilia Clarke plays Kate. She dresses like an elf, she works in a year-round Christmas-ornament shop and her life is a mess. Enter the dashing Tom, played by Henry Golding (Crazy Rich Asians). He's handsome, kind and quirky \u2014 but, of course, there is something elusive about him. The movie is set to George Michael tunes and co-stars (and is co-written by) Emma Thompson. It takes place in a glittering, wintry London. \"We shot it last Christmas, in fact,\" Clarke says. \"And we shot it in the middle of the night, largely speaking, because on Regent Street, if you were to do it in any other time it would be rammed with tourists. And so to do that, we had to we had to use the available light. So the only light that we could bring was soft light, and so we just brought an obscene amount of fairy lights. So the London that you see in our movie is already beautiful \u2014 and then we made it 10 times sparklier.\" Clarke spoke on her character Kate, singing in the movie and what's next after Game of Thrones. On her character, Kate No, she's not the mother of dragons. She's got mother-of-dragon tendencies ... Yeah, so Kate \u2014 she is your anti-heroine. We're quite used to seeing, I think, in rom-coms a sort of perfect depiction of a young lady \u2014 and that ain't Kate. And it's in her flaws, is where she becomes so relatable. So she is struggling to get herself together, and she's struggling to take care of herself, she's struggling to take care of those around her, not really accepting help, kind of. You can tell she's hiding from something, and life isn't bringing her much joy when we first meet her. But she is trying. On Kate's mom, a refugee played by \"the glorious Emma Thompson\" Emilia Clarke (left) and Emma Thompson star in Last Christmas, which Thompson co-wrote.\n                \n                    \n                    Universal Pictures\n                    \n                \nhide caption Emilia Clarke (left) and Emma Thompson star in Last Christmas, which Thompson co-wrote. Emma co-wrote this with her husband Greg Wise, and the character that Emma plays is loosely based on Greg's mom. And she is really struggling to find peace in the United Kingdom, which they have fled to because her memories of where she had to run from \u2014 former Yugoslavia and the war that they escaped \u2014 kind of haunt her every single day, and lead her to be slightly more anxious and worried and vocal. On singing in the movie Oh, it was incredibly nerve-wracking, because I care so much about singing, and I'm genuinely at my happiest when I am singing. However: Doing it on camera in front of a lot of people, and doing it, you know, with George's perfect song was \u2014 every time before I sing I just think I'm getting tonsillitis, or my throat is closing up or something. So it took a lot of courage, but I got there. On Kate's health issues and how they relate to her own, which she recently disclosed I wouldn't say it was the defining thing that brought me to [the movie]. Dame Emma Thompson probably was that. But it definitely allowed me to bring quite a lot of truth to what Kate's struggles were, because for Kate she had her health crisis in her early 20s, and that's when I had mine too. And that time for any young person is incredibly intimidating. On the depictions of immigrants and Brexit in the movie Clarke: Well, we're showing a movie that is now, that is today. And I don't think that Emma or Greg could have written something about London today without mentioning it, without having it. And they're both politically outspoken, and care deeply about the refugee crisis, and care deeply about Brexit, and about inclusivity and community and the diverse multicultural thing that is London. Garcia-Navarro: Yeah. What are your views on Brexit? Clarke: Oh heavens, it's heartbreaking. We've just heard now that we will have a snap election, which I think is a very good thing indeed, because I think it's going to put a full stop ... maybe a comma after this very long, drawn-out situation we've been in since 2016, really. But I mean, I'm pathologically hopeful as a human being, and I'm pathologically hopeful that maybe we'll just, you know, see the error of our ways, and remain, and just stay. On what types of roles she's seeking after Game of Thrones So I've had the good fortune of being in this incredible show with this incredible character. And my goodness, if I were to get stereotyped as the mother of dragons, I could ask for worse. It's really quite wonderful. But what it's left me with \u2014 after 10 years of seeing that, and being a part of that, and of doing quite big movies in my hiatuses and all of those things \u2014 is a yearning for a different sort of creative ownership. So I started my production company about three years ago \u2014 very, very quietly because I didn't want it to go wrong and have it be public knowledge \u2014 and now I've got six or seven things on my slate that I'm writing and producing. And because there is \u2014 I mean, you know, the landscape has changed for young actresses and actors for the sort of roles that are out there. I struggle to find them, because the thing that I've learned from being on 10 years in the show is that the biggest luxury in life is time and space. So I wanted to take those two things, which I have very luckily been able to have now, and really consider what my next option is. Because I care about what I'm doing with my time. Dana Cronin and D.

To listen to this episode, play the audio at the top of the page or subscribe. For more, sign up for the newsletter and follow @NPRLifeKit on Twitter. Fake news has consequences. Back in 2016, before the term was even part of our national vocabulary, it threw the government of Twin Falls, Idaho, into chaos. Rumors of a government cover-up involving child molestation and Syrian refugees swirled. They soon leaped from the fringes of the Internet to kitchen tables and the mainstream media. \"Members of the local government, the mayor, the city council members, local judges, the county prosecutor, they were basically inundated for months on end with threats,\" says Caitlin Dickerson, who covered the story for The New York Times. \"Violent threats. Very visceral and descriptive threats from all over the world.\" But the outrage was not based on facts. The details were blurred in some cases, completely fabricated in others, depending on the storyteller and their agenda. It was a grave example of how misinformation can have a terrifying real-world impact. But falsehoods aren't hard to come by in today's information landscape. Here are five tips to help you spot misinformation. (Or if you would rather listen, check out the Life Kit podcast here.) 1) Exercise skepticism Take in any new information, whether it's the news or on social media or from a buddy at happy hour, with a bit of doubt. Expect the source to prove their work and show how they came to their conclusion. And try to compare information from a number of different outlets, even if you have a favorite. 2)     Understand the misinformation landscape Misinformation, as a concept, isn't new. But the social media platforms for engaging with it are constantly changing and increasing their influence in the media world. Those platforms have no financial obligation to tell the truth \u2014 their business models depend on user engagement. Reducing your dependence on social media will be good for your news judgment (and your sleep). 3) Pay extra attention when reading about emotionally-charged and divisive topics Misinformation is most effective on hot-button issues and immediate news. Ask yourself: Is this a complicated subject, something that's hitting an emotional trigger? Or is it a breaking news story where the facts aren't yet able to be assembled? If the answer is yes, then you need to be ultra-skeptical. 4) Investigate what you're reading or seeing What does that skepticism look like in practice? It means asking some questions of what you're reading or seeing: Is the content paid for by a company or politician or other potentially biased source? Is there good evidence? And are the numbers presented in context? (The News Literacy Project created an app to help people test and strengthen their media literacy skills.) 5) Yelling probably won't solve misinformation It's important to value the truth, but correcting people is always delicate. If someone in your life is spreading objective falsehoods and you want to help, be humble. Don't assume bad intentions or stupidity, just meet the other person where they are and be curious \u2014 think about opening with common ground and a question. Try to have the conversation in person or at least in a private online setting, like an email. If you want more resources, Media Literacy Now is a good place to start.",

            "article_content": "White evangelicals have been among President Trump's most solid supporters, but younger evangelicals are more skeptical of the president heading into the 2020 election.  NOEL KING, HOST: Do young white evangelicals have the same allegiance to President Trump and to the Republican Party that their parents do? A growing body of evidence says they do not. NPR's Jessica Taylor went to a Christian college campus in Michigan, a swing state, to ask students there what they are thinking about the 2020 election. JESSICA TAYLOR, BYLINE: Growing up, Karsten Rees says his parents had a specific view about religion and politics. KARSTEN REES: They used to say that, like, Christians who voted Democrat were, like, not real Christians. And the implication there is that they're, like, going to hell. TAYLOR: But looking at President Trump, the sophomore at Calvin University in Grand Rapids began to question that idea as he dug deeper into the Bible. REES: Loving your neighbor. The classic - whatever you do unto the least of these, you do unto me. And I started, like, looking at policies that were happening, like separation of children at the border, and I just didn't think that Christ would be a big fan of that. TAYLOR: Rees isn't alone among Calvin's 3,700 students or other young evangelicals. Polling shows that while white evangelicals as a whole still approve of the job Trump is doing, the younger demographic isn't as fervent. And here in Michigan, a state Trump carried by less than 11,000 votes, any movement toward Democrats could be detrimental. KRISTIN KOBES DU MEZ: I think that there are a lot of Christians, especially young Christians, who do feel politically homeless. TAYLOR: That's Dr. Kristin Kobes Du Mez, a Calvin professor who studies the intersection of American history, religion and politics. She says younger evangelicals are more likely to support LGBTQ rights and refugees. KOBES DU MEZ: I think they're much more comfortable with diversity. I think they feel a little less threatened that their way of life is under siege. TAYLOR: Calvin is affiliated with the Christian Reformed Church, which is conservative theologically but has a tradition of social justice. And the school has some pretty famous Republican alumni, including Education Secretary Betsy DeVos. Buildings on campus bear both her maiden and married names. Professors and students say the university is about split politically, but that a majority still lean conservative, like Emerson Silvernail. He's the student body president at Calvin. He voted for Trump in 2016 after wavering. EMERSON SILVERNAIL: My ultimate choice came down to the fact that there was going to be a Supreme Court nominee, and so that was my justification at the time. But I do not know if I would be willing to vote for him again. TAYLOR: Senior Sarah Vroegop voted third party instead, influenced by her conservative upbringing. Three years later, she says it's a choice she deeply regrets. And in 2020, she'll be voting for a Democrat. SARAH VROEGOP: It makes me sad because I see Christians willing to support President Trump on the basis of a few of his policies or because they are so comfortable being politically conservative, and they are willing to ignore his rhetoric and the things that he says. TAYLOR: It wasn't until after the 2016 election that the college Democrats had a chapter at Calvin. Lorrayya Williams is the group's president. LORRAYYA WILLIAMS: It kind of formed as a response to, like, the election of Trump because we thought it would be good to represent the liberals on campus. TAYLOR: But Democrats still have to work on reaching out to voters of faith. Sophomore Stephanie Wynia grew up home-schooled in a conservative evangelical family but says she doesn't like what Trump represents. She's not sure who she'll vote for, but she knows what she wants to hear. STEPHANIE WYNIA: For me, faith is definitely part of the policy decision-making process. And so if I can understand the political candidates' faith background and what they're bringing to the decisions they're making, it's going to be compelling for me to vote for them. TAYLOR: That's something Hillary Clinton struggled to do in 2016. In 2020, Democratic candidates have a new chance to reach these younger evangelical voters.

            "article_content": "The Brutal and Chaotic History of Russia's Exiles, \u00c9migr\u00e9s, and Agents Abroad by Andrei Soldatov and Irina Borogan Hardcover, 361 pages | Your purchase helps support NPR programming. How? The Kremlin's reckless foray into U.S. domestic politics, coupled with a whole list of dangerous adventures elsewhere around the world, has triggered an avalanche of conspiracy theories and nutty commentary that make Moscow's foreign correspondent corps cringe and despair. A new book, The Compatriots: The Brutal and Chaotic History of Russia's Exiles, \u00c9migr\u00e9s, and Agents Abroad, is different though, even if it covers a century of clandestine operations, \"active measures\" and political assassinations conducted both by and against Russians \u2014 who either found themselves in the West as refugees or were sent there as Kremlin's agents. The author duo, Andrei Soldatov and Irina Borogan, are two of the most revered experts on the subject of Russian secret services \u2014 and ones who have cultivated multiple insider sources in the world of spies during their two-decades as journalists in Moscow. Not only does it give the book a credibility most other publications on this subject lack, but it also changes the optics. What many Western authors often present as an epic attack of soulless aliens on their cozy, civilized world transforms here into a set of fascinating human stories. Some of these amount to a family saga, as characters belonging to the same close-knit family of spies and assassins keep popping up at different points in time \u2014 from the Bolshevik Red Terror to Vladimir Putin's hunt on domestic opposition. It is also written in pithy language and reads like a bunch of Hollywood plots bundled together into one mind-bending narrative. The authors trace the genesis of Kremlin's latest behavioral patterns from the origins of Soviet secret services, which emerged essentially out of international terrorist cells at the time when the Bolsheviks \u2014 the ISIS of the early 20th century \u2014 subjugated Russia through unprecedented terror that by far exceeded people's threshold of pain. Having lost the elections to the Constituent Assembly in 1917, they drowned the country in blood during the Civil War and subsequent decades of terror in order to stay in power. It was those underground operatives, from all sorts of ethnic and national backgrounds, bound by the idea of a global revolution that have shaped a culture that persists today. Their largely non-ideological heirs from modern Russia's secret services conducted a successful state capture during the two decades of Putin's rein. Be it the poisoning of the defector Sergei Skripal in Britain or online disinformation campaigns in America \u2014 Borogan and Soldatov trace these patterns back to the heady days of post-revolutionary terror and to a community of security agents that has for a century enjoyed a certain level of autonomy from political leadership and absolutely no oversight from civil society. The strata they (and their Western adversaries) have operated within since the 1920s is the multi-million, Russian-speaking diaspora ejected from their motherland by Communist totalitarianism and continuously refilled with Putin's opponents today. The authors go through successive waves of emigration \u2014 from the White Russians to anti-Putin opposition via World War II refugees and Jewish refuseniks of the 1970s \u2014 looking at how Kremlin agents tried to influence and recruit some of them, while silencing or physically destroying the others. What emerges is a surreal landscape of shifting loyalties and changing political views, most surprisingly among the agents themselves. It feels like almost everyone sooner or later finds themselves on the verge of defection, especially when the political leadership is driven by personal paranoia rather than ideological principles and interests of the state. The evolution of that paranoia, from Joseph Stalin's genocidal insanity to Putin's self-defeating obsession about security, is another invaluable takeaway from this book. Ideological and psychological evolutions of some characters are equally fascinating. A Jewish pogrom survivor becomes Stalin's deadliest assassin. An ardent Communists turns into a hardened CIA operative. A woman raised as an unquestioning fighter for the global dictatorship of proletariat blesses her grandson to turn into a shrewd financial speculator. A scion of an aristocratic White Guard family helps Putin grab an opposition TV channel and the independent White Russian church. These changes might seem random, but in fact they are not. True Communist idealists naturally gravitate towards Western liberal democracies when they are confronted with the reality of a post-Soviet state. Staunch anti-communists with monarchist and/or Nazi-collaborator backgrounds seamlessly accept Putin's illiberal rhetoric and authoritarianism. But perhaps the most striking part of the book comes towards the end when authors turn from historians back into reporters and embark on investigating a less well-known case of two alleged assassination attempts on a Putin's opponent (it has never been proven). This is complemented by a convincing analysis of why this person might have been targeted. On a more subjective note (given that I know quite a few of the characters and have met the authors), I wish this book had been thicker and some of the plots rolled out less sketchily. I also wish the editors had been less patronizing to the U.S. audience when it comes to simplifying various aspects of Russian history and politics. Using \"Russian\" and \"Soviet\" interchangeably, as it often happens in the book, is also neither helpful nor historically accurate. But it is a great read that now forms a perfect trilogy with two previous books by the same authors \u2014 The New Nobility, which describes how secret services captured the Russian state under Putin, and The Red Web, which looks into the Kremlin's attempts to control the Internet. One might think that this latest book goes to show that \"nothing has changed\" in Russia and its relations with the West. But it, in fact, shows the opposite. After all, we have two Moscow-based journalists investigating what would have certainly landed them in the Gulag a century ago. On the other hand, both Russia and the Western world no longer afford the option of living in a hermetic sarcophagus that blocks them from any foreign influence (or indeed meddling) whatsoever. In that sense, there is no more domestic politics anymore \u2014 Russia's politics is a domestic issue for the U.S. as much as U.S. politics is a domestic issue for Russia. So let's learn to live with it. Leonid Ragozin is a freelance journalist based in Latvia. He previously worked for the BBC for a dozen years, was a foreign correspondent for the Russian Newsweek. and is an author for Lonely Planet.",

The protesters chanted slogans condemning Turkey's military action and urging the withdrawal of Turkish forces. The airstrikes and artillery bombardments had barely begun in the Syrian city of Qamishli, just across the border from Turkey, when Bassam Ishak's cellphone began ringing. \"People were so scared,\" Ishak said. \"They were telling me, 'They are bombing us right now!' \" Ishak, a Syriac Christian leader, was in Irbil, Iraq, monitoring developments along the Syria-Turkey border. \"The attacks are widespread,\" Ishak told NPR by phone. \"They are targeting residential areas in Qamishli, where people of all religious backgrounds live. We think this is a message to the Kurds and Christians there to leave, so Turkey can move refugees there. We think it's a form of ethnic cleansing.\" By Thursday, Turkish ground forces had reportedly seized at least one village from Kurdish fighters in Syria, and the U.N. refugee agency reported that thousands of people were fleeing the Turkish advance. Turkey launched its incursion into Syria three days after President Trump told Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan that U.S. troops stationed along the border would be withdrawn. About 40,000 or 50,000 Christians live in the area under attack, according to Ishak, president of the Syriac National Council of Syria, and U.S. Christian leaders have been almost unanimous in criticizing what they see as Trump's acquiescence to the Turkish move. \"What a disgrace,\" tweeted Russell Moore, head of the public policy arm of the Southern Baptist Convention. \"Kurdish Christians (and others among the brave Kurds) have stood up for the United States and for freedom and human dignity. ... What they are now facing from Erdogan's authoritarian Turkey is horrifying beyond words.\" Psalm 73:11- \u201cAnd the wicked say, \u2018God does not see; God does not know what is happening.\u2019\u201dThis is wicked and unjust, and is seen by a God who will have the last word. What a disgrace. Among those Christian leaders now criticizing President Trump are several evangelicals who have been loyal supporters, including Franklin Graham, son of Billy Graham. \"The Kurds are the ones who have been leading the fight against ISIS,\" Graham tweeted. \"Pray for the Christians who the Kurds have been protecting. They could be annihilated. Would you pray with me that @realDonaldTrump will reconsider?\" The Kurds are the ones who have been leading the fight against ISIS in Syria. Also pray for the Christians who the Kurds have been protecting. They could be annihilated. Would you pray w/me that Pres. @realDonaldTrump will reconsider? Thousands of lives hang in the balance. 2/2 Pat Robertson, founder of the Christian Broadcasting Network, went so far as to warn earlier this week that Trump was at risk \"of losing the mandate of heaven.\" Faced with such criticism, Trump on Tuesday released a statement defending his decision to pull U.S. troops out of the way of the Turkish advance. \"The United States does not endorse this attack and has made it clear to Turkey that this operation is a bad idea,\" Trump said. \"Turkey has committed to protecting civilians, protecting religious minorities, including Christians, and ensuring no humanitarian crisis takes place\u2014and we will hold them to this commitment.\" Trump's statement, however, did not reassure Tony Perkins, the evangelical leader Trump chose as chairman of the U.S. Commission on International Religious Freedom. \"I do not have a high level of confidence \u2014 in fact, I have no confidence \u2014 that Turkey will preserve true religious freedom or protect those religious minorities,\" Perkins told NPR.\"We could see another genocide in that region.\" Just a year ago, Perkins negotiated with Turkish authorities to secure the release of Andrew Brunson, a U.S. evangelical Christian pastor who had been imprisoned in Turkey for two years. As the USCIRF chairman, Perkins has advocated for religious freedom in the Middle East. The Kurdish-controlled area of northern Syria is one of the few places where people of different faith traditions have lived together. \"Our concern is that this emerging model could be lost,\" Perkins says. \"You actually have Muslims who have converted to Christianity, and others, and they're openly practicing their faith. They become targets, and the concern is a kind of a domino effect with the Turkish forces focusing on the Kurds. [When] the Kurds flee, the Christians become vulnerable.\" Most Christians in the Syrian province of Hasakeh, the focus of Turkish attacks, have fled during the past eight years of fighting in Syria, according to Ishak. \"If they keep targeting this area, it won't take much to force those who are still there to leave,\" he said.",

It was two days before opening night, and director Kholoud Sawaf darted around the set, making sure every detail was in order. Jasmine and tuberose to perfume the air. The sound of birdsong. Lighting to evoke daybreak in her hometown, Damascus. Sawaf was recreating the Syria of her memories on a stage at TheatreSquared, housed in a gleaming new building in Fayetteville, Ark. Her play, 10,000 Balconies, is loosely based on Romeo and Juliet, with star-crossed lovers named Rumman and Jasmeen. The idea, Sawaf said, was to show Americans a richer view of Syria than war and misery. She envisioned a love story. Set in Damascus. Performed in Arkansas. \"How na\u00efve,\" Sawaf said one recent day, with a wry laugh that comes from hindsight. The workshop production of 10,000 Balconies that opened over the weekend follows a three-year nightmare, a devastating collision of art and politics. Sawaf's ordeal exposes the deep, open wounds of the Syrian civil war. And it's a reminder that the Trump administration's travel ban, largely absent from headlines, is still causing heartache all over the world, including at a theater in Northwest Arkansas. \"I can't help but be angry,\" Sawaf said. \"I don't like to create from a place of anger, but I can't help but be.\" Laura Shatkus, associate director of 10,000 Balconies, and Mohamad Alrefai, actor and cultural consultant for the play, sit at TheatreSquared.\n                \n                    \n                    Sarah Bentham for NPR\n                    \n                \nhide caption Laura Shatkus, associate director of 10,000 Balconies, and Mohamad Alrefai, actor and cultural consultant for the play, sit at TheatreSquared. From Damascus to the Bible Belt In 2012, a year into the Syrian conflict, Sawaf had just finished college and was in Damascus figuring out what to do next. She'd worked in television throughout the region, but was feeling a pull toward theater. At a mentor's suggestion, she decided to apply for grad school in the United States. Sawaf had never left the Middle East and didn't know where to begin, so she did a Google search for theater programs in all 50 states, in alphabetical order. Because of the weak internet connection, Sawaf said, she didn't get very far. Alabama, Alaska, Arizona... \"Arkansas!\" Sawaf said, jokingly pronouncing the last \"s\" like she did before she learned it's silent. \"Bad internet \u2014 that's how I ended up in Arkansas.\" Participants in a community workshop discuss cultural elements of the play prior to opening night.\n                \n                    \n                    Sarah Bentham for NPR\n                    \n                \nhide caption Participants in a community workshop discuss cultural elements of the play prior to opening night. She had to adapt to life as a headscarf-wearing Muslim woman in the Bible Belt. She couldn't just walk around Fayetteville like any other University of Arkansas student. She felt scrutinized, whether it was glares from the bigots or cloying smiles from the do-gooders. \"I just want to walk in the grocery store and be invisible,\" Sawaf said. \"I don't want anybody to smile at me, and I don't want anyone to isolate me and stare at me and have a billion questions because I wear a hijab.\" After grad school, Sawaf remained in the United States on theater fellowships. During one program in New York, she began to think about a play that would challenge the narrow lens through which much of the West views Muslims and Arabs, specifically Syrians. She asked herself what it would take to move an audience away from ingrained notions of terrorism and oppression. \"It had to be love,\" she said. She hadn't read much Shakespeare at the time, but she felt drawn to the timeless story of Romeo and Juliet. She began writing a loose adaptation told through two young lovers who quote Arabic poetry to one another from balconies in the picturesque old quarter of Damascus.

The project sounded timely, even hopeful, amid the ugliness of the 2016 presidential race, when campaign rhetoric vilified immigrants and Muslims. The Doris Duke Foundation for Islamic Art awarded Sawaf's project a $250,000 grant, through TheatreSquared in Arkansas. (The foundation is an extension of the Doris Duke Charitable Trust, a financial supporter of NPR.) With the funding, Sawaf's vision came into focus. \"All the possibilities that you start imagining,\" she said. \"OK, run with the dream. Here's an open door.\" Sawaf got busy writing and refining the script. But when she showed early drafts in workshop sessions, she said, she was stunned to hear feedback full of assumptions and stereotypes about Muslims or Arab culture. She said one critic accused her of misrepresenting Syria by leaving out honor killings. \"That has shaken me for three years,\" Sawaf said. \"I was like, OK, I have to take it into closed doors, and work hard before I could expose it again.\" Sawaf retreated into her writing and became choosier about who got to see it. She was still plugging away when, in early 2017, the project suffered another blow. President Trump took office and within days announced a travel ban on several majority-Muslim countries, including Syria. That killed any chance of bringing in Syrian artists and musicians. Worse, Sawaf's parents had just resettled in Canada, but they felt as far away as ever. \"We were very hopeful that that would allow us to see each other,\" she said. \"And it only feels more painful to be just across the border and not be able to do it.\" They were stuck: Sawaf's parents in Canada, where her mom was being treated for breast cancer. And Sawaf in Arkansas, feeling the love drain from the love story she was trying to write. Because of the travel ban, if she left the U.S., she wouldn't be allowed to return. \"You can't help but feel that you are in prison,\" she said. \"Even if the prison is big, and gold.\" She fell into extended periods of despair and grief \u2014 over the war, the travel ban, her mother's illness, the isolation in Arkansas. She couldn't write, couldn't think. For weeks, Sawaf said, she could barely get out of bed. \"There was definitely moments of collapse, just complete suspicion, complete questioning, complete 'Can I do this?' \" Sawaf said.

A small group of friends and artistic collaborators stuck by Sawaf in those dark stretches. Among them was grad school friend and 10,000 Balconies associate director, Laura Shatkus. She had tears streaming down her face as she talked about watching Sawaf work through the trauma. \"It's been a rich, extremely rich, artistic experience to watch the thing go from something that scared her and made her upset to something she approaches with total joy,\" Shatkus said. Sawaf credits Shatkus for helping to revive the play. Ultimately, though, Sawaf said, she knew she had to find it in herself to save the project. She started by letting go of some of the Shakespearean influence and allowing in themes she once fought to keep out, such as war and displacement. Still, she insisted on addressing the pain on her own terms. Instead of violence, there's a graffiti battle. Instead of a forced displacement, a Syrian couple gets to decide whether they want to stay or go. And there are scenes that show how life endures on the margins of war \u2014 people still get married, gossip about their neighbors, dance to pop songs. \"Pomegranates and jasmine and grapes and trees and balconies,\" Sawaf said. \"The Damascus I carry is the one that I hid and brought with me. It's not what they see in the news.\" Sawaf agonized over the separation from her parents, but they tried to bridge the distance with family conference calls about the play. Her parents were prominent journalists back in Syria, and they weren't shy about sharing their ideas for the script. Sawaf laughed recalling a 5 a.m. text from her mom with a suggestion for the character Jasmeen. \"They both got copies of Romeo and Juliet in Arabic and they started to read it so that they're up to date with what I'm creating,\" Sawaf said. \"They're really cute.\" After working through some of the loss and grief, Sawaf said, her creativity began to flow again. A breakthrough came when her dark sense of humor returned, in a line she wrote about striking a yoga pose to avoid sniper fire. She recalled thinking, \"OK, that can be in the play. Now I'm back.\" But the clock was ticking. Her artist's visa was running out. She had to scramble to come up with a cast and crew. Hadi Eldebek, a New York-based musician who's collaborated with Yo-Yo Ma's Silkroad Ensemble, wrote the original music. And, Sawaf said, she lucked out with the actors, finding Arab and Arab-American artists in other cities. The play 10,000 Balconies is loosely based on the story of Romeo and Juliet.

The cast arrived just a couple of weeks before opening night, so there had been little time to memorize lines and rehearse. Mohamad Alrefai, an actor who came from Syria a couple years ago, said he never doubted that Sawaf could make it happen. \"I knew that she's really going to fight for it because she believes in it,\" he said. \"We are not giving up.\" A bittersweet opening night On opening night last Friday, ticketholders streamed into TheatreSquared, which was decorated with flourishes from Damascus. There were mother-of-pearl boxes, a wooden backgammon set, posters of landmark mosques and palaces. Guests were offered Syrian pastries and tamarind juice. Audience member Ruta Jaudegis said she was eager to learn from 10,000 Balconies. When asked what springs to mind when she hears \"Syria,\" Jaudegis' voice caught and her eyes grew wet. \"Refugees,\" she said. Her own family had fled Lithuania during World War II. \"Breaks my heart.\" Upstairs, the actors and musicians led audience members in an interactive workshop to acquaint them with the instruments, melodies, and poetry they were about to hear. Jodie Root and Greg Gilmet took part, dancing by the end of it. The couple said productions like this in Fayetteville made them embarrassed to admit the preconceived notions they had of Arkansas when they moved here from Minneapolis, home to a lively arts scene, two years ago. \"I can come five blocks and see a show by a Syrian playwright? In Arkansas? Who would've thought,\" Root said. \"What they're trying to do here is very important,\" Gilmet added. In the lobby, Sawaf clutched flowers from a well-wisher and observed the crowd arrive. The look on her face was a blend of excitement and anxiety. She said the absence of her parents was hanging over the evening. 10,000 Balconies is an interpretation of Romeo and Juliet.\n\n                    \n                    Sarah Bentham for NPR\n                    \n                \nhide caption 10,000 Balconies is an interpretation of Romeo and Juliet. She was standing next to a computer display showing maps of Damascus and Fayetteville side by side. On the screen, the cities were just two grids, crisscrossing lines marking streets and neighborhoods where ordinary people live. \"It's far, but it's not far. It's here,\" Sawaf said. \"They're this close to each other.\" The production she was about to show isn't exactly the love story she set out to tell. It's still evolving; she's still healing. \"It's definitely a combination of love and loss, and it feels unfinished,\" she said. \"And I think I'm OK with that.\" The sound of drumming swelled from the lobby. A procession was forming to lead guests into the theater. A woman in the crowd released a long zaghrouta, the high-pitched ululation that marks celebrations in many parts of the Middle East. Sawaf had to run. It was showtime.",

Nearly two decades into the war in Afghanistan, the U.S. suddenly appears to be nearing an agreement with the Taliban that could bring the remaining 14,000 U.S. troops home. That's causing unease inside the Afghan government, which has been left on the sidelines as the U.S. and the Taliban have held multiple rounds of talks this year in the Gulf nation of Qatar. The latest round wrapped up last week without a deal, but with signs of progress. The Afghan government says it's prepared to negotiate with the Taliban \u2014 but the Taliban are refusing to reciprocate, calling the Afghan government an American puppet. Roya Rahmani, Afghanistan's ambassador to the U.S., said that while she supports efforts toward peace, \"peace negotiations would start when the Taliban are able and ready to face the Afghan people, the people they are fighting, and their legitimate elected government.\" The Taliban seized power in her homeland in the 1990s, when she was a teenager. She spent most of those years as a refugee in Pakistan, but in visits home during that time, she says she \"found my country drained of energy and worse than that, drained of hope.\" Afghan Ambassador to the U.S. Roya Rahmani remembers that her country was \"drained of energy\" when the Taliban was in power.\n                \n                    \n                    Amr Alfiky/NPR\n                    \n                \nhide caption Afghan Ambassador to the U.S. Roya Rahmani remembers that her country was \"drained of energy\" when the Taliban was in power. Many analysts are wondering whether a U.S.-Taliban deal is simply a way for the Americans to pull out of a gridlocked war, or will it lead to a genuine peace in Afghanistan. \"It remains to be seen if this is a negotiation that just concludes the U.S.'s role in Afghanistan, or if these are negotiations that actually conclude the Afghan conflict and help bring some degree of sustainability to the region after over four decades of war,\" said Dan Feldman of the Center for American Progress. Under President Barack Obama, he served as the State Department's special representative for Afghanistan and Pakistan. \"That will depend in large part on the leverage that the U.S. will continue to have to encourage and facilitate an intra-Afghan negotiation that will actually achieve some stability in the country,\" he added. President Trump has said he wants to bring the U.S. troops home and is suggesting that a deal is plausible. \"Many on the opposite side of this 19 year war, and us, are looking to make a deal - if possible!\" he tweeted on Friday. But there are still obstacles. The Taliban want a timeline for all U.S. troops to leave. According to people familiar with the talks, the period under discussion would be two years or less. The U.S. says the Taliban must agree on several things: a permanent cease-fire, renunciation of al-Qaida, and negotiations with the Afghan government. Zalmay Khalilzad is leading the U.S. negotiations with the Taliban. After months of talks, the two sides appear close to a deal that could lead to the withdrawal of U.S. troops in Afghanistan.\n                \n                    \n                    Jacquelyn Martin/AP\n                    \n                \nhide caption Zalmay Khalilzad is leading the U.S. negotiations with the Taliban. After months of talks, the two sides appear close to a deal that could lead to the withdrawal of U.S. troops in Afghanistan. \"We are not cutting and running. We are not looking for a withdrawal agreement. We're looking for a peace agreement,\" Zalmay Khalilzad, the Trump administration's envoy on Afghanistan, said recently. But even if the two sides reach a deal, a host of sticky questions remain. Would the Taliban stick to the agreement? Would it be acceptable to the Afghan government? And to what extent would the Taliban and Afghan government be able to negotiate a power-sharing agreement that would last? Moreover, what kind of role would the Taliban play in Afghan politics, and would it accept changes since it was driven from power in 2001, such as increased opportunities for women? Human rights observers are concerned that a deal could significantly roll back women's rights. \"I think if we look at the gains made since 2001, you know, women's rights have been at the forefront of those gains, and they've been hard fought,\" Patricia Gossman of Human Rights Watch recently told NPR. \"I think women ... rightly fear that in any deal, or if in fact things don't lead to peace but lead to renewed fighting, women's rights will suffer.\" Finally, militant groups such as ISIS could play a complicating role. Over the weekend, a suicide bombing at a wedding in Kabul killed at least 63 people, and the attack was reportedly claimed by a local ISIS affiliate. Trump faces a tough decision. He consistently says he wants to pull U.S. troops out of Afghanistan \u2014 one of the few points of agreement with most Democratic presidential candidates. But the president is getting pushback from the military and other parts of the national security establishment. They are warning that a U.S. pullout could lead to an unraveling of Afghanistan. The U.S. presence in Afghanistan topped out at more than 100,000 under Obama. It's now down to around 14,000, but the U.S. is providing critical support. The Americans train Afghan troops, they gather intelligence and they carry out airstrikes. Rahmani, the Afghan ambassador, stresses that a real peace deal will need to be rooted in trust to succeed. \"What we are seeing now, the way it's going now, that does not ensure and build that trust that is required for a peace deal to succeed, for a real peace to find its way to Afghanistan,\" she said.  The Afghan government wants security guarantees to make sure the Taliban can't resort to violence if they don't get their way politically. The government also wants to preserve the country's political system, which includes a presidential election on Sept. 28.",

But in the past three years, Tuscany has experienced political upheaval as the hard-right, anti-immigrant League party has won elections in many towns, marking the first losses for the left in Tuscany in more than seven decades. Pisa is one of those towns. It's home to three universities that have long attracted students from all over the world \u2014 some of whom settled in the Tuscan city. In its Square of Miracles, the cathedral, baptistry and iconic Leaning Tower were built more than 1,000 years ago in a blend of Byzantine and Islamic styles, symbolizing the powerful maritime republic's trade links across the Mediterranean. Today, Pisa is home to more than 90,000 people, with a Muslim community of 2,000. Three years ago, the center-left administration provisionally approved a request to build a mosque. But after the League won power last year, the new mayor vetoed the mosque's construction, fulfilling a campaign promise. Mohammad Khalil, an Italian citizen of Palestinian origin who came to Italy 39 years ago to study engineering, is president of Pisa's Muslim community. \"I guess fearmongering works,\" says Khalil. \"The League keeps saying 'Italians first,' but many of us are also Italian citizens and just as concerned about security as everyone else is.\" In Cascina, the League headquarters features a poster showing Mayor Susanna Ceccardi, who also recently won a seat in the European Parliament in Brussels.\n                \n                    \n                    Sylvia Poggioli/NPR\n                    \n                \nhide caption In Cascina, the League headquarters features a poster showing Mayor Susanna Ceccardi, who also recently won a seat in the European Parliament in Brussels. Repeated requests by NPR for interviews with Pisa's Mayor Michele Conti or members of his administration were refused. But Davide Cinini, a former leftist, is willing to explain why he embraced the hard-right League. He accuses the center-left Democratic Party \u2014 in power at the national level for five years until last June \u2014 of following European Union orders imposing austerity measures that, he says, led to increased economic stagnation and high unemployment. \"When a leftist party promotes policies that are not leftist, are against the working class, I'm not the one who has changed,\" he says. \"It's what's happening around me that has changed.\" Democratic Party activist Michele Ceraolo acknowledges the left failed to grasp Italians' economic anxieties after the 2008 financial crisis. But, he says, that's not the only reason why entrenched political affiliations have been swept away in Italy's leftist-leaning \"red belt.\" \"The right at the moment has a strong storytelling, the left has none,\" he says. \"The right knows how to talk to the heart of the people: 'I know that you are insecure, you have fear.' \" One place in Tuscany where migrants are still welcomed is San Miniato, a medieval town halfway between Pisa and Florence, perched on sloping hills dotted with olive groves.

Many migrants have found jobs in local tanneries that produce Tuscany's luxury leather goods \u2014 jobs that many Italians don't want. That fear often centers on the more than 600,000 migrants who arrived in Italy in the past five years. The League's surge in local and national elections followed that migration surge. Since party leader Matteo Salvini became Italy's deputy prime minister last year, his popularity has soared. He has ordered the bulldozing of camps where Roma families lived, sharply curtailed funds for refugee shelters and shut down Italy's ports to migrant rescue ships. Anti-migrant sentiment is spreading. Ten miles from Pisa, the town of Cascina, once renowned for its household furniture workshops, has seen its local industry all but wiped out by global competition and the financial crisis. Cascina is where the League won its first breakthrough in Tuscany in 2016, ousting the left after 71 years in power. After that election, a local parish priest, the Rev. Elvis Ragusa, was sharply criticized by a League councilor for inviting asylum-seekers living in a nearby camp for free breakfasts before Sunday Mass. Ragusa says some migrants asked for Bibles and crosses. When a local newspaper reported this, \"The councilor of the League talked against me because I am a priest that was giving a Bible and crosses to Christians,\" he says. \"And that is crazy.\" The League administration ordered the camp shut down. The asylum-seekers were sent to other parts of Italy. One place in Tuscany where migrants are still welcomed is San Miniato, a medieval town halfway between Pisa and Florence, perched on sloping hills dotted with olive groves. A cooperative called La Pietra d'Angolo, \"Cornerstone,\" provides lodging and assistance for asylum-seekers and has hosted some 250 refugees over the past four years. Director Michela de Vita says there has never been any violence or tension with area residents. Many migrants have found jobs in local tanneries that produce Tuscany's luxury leather goods \u2014 tough jobs that, she says, many Italians don't want. San Miniato voters recently reelected the center-left administration, but de Vita acknowledges that the Democratic Party has lived too long on its past successes. \"Party leaders have lost contact with their electorate,\" she says. \"They don't go out and talk to people. They say, 'We're strong, we'll keep winning,' but that's how you end up losing.\" De Vita says the right-wing national government's recent drastic cuts in funding for migrants have forced organizations like hers to lay off staff and eliminate Italian language classes that are crucial tools for integration. She worries more oppressive government policies will lead to friction in San Miniato between migrants and residents and further electoral victories for the League. A half-hour's drive north is the town of Montecatini, whose thermal springs were immortalized by Federico Fellini in his 1963 film 8\u00bd. For decades, Montecatini was a bastion of the left. There's a festive mood at a spa where men and women sip prosecco as they celebrate the League's victory in municipal elections last May. Walls at the spa are covered with posters proclaiming \"Italy first\" and hailing Salvini \u2014 \"il Capitano\" \u2014 as national savior. Andrea Picchielli, a local League leader and member of its Foreign Relations Department, accuses the Democratic Party of doing nothing to stop the migrant influx. \"Sometimes they call us racist,\" he says. \"We are not racist at all. We want to help people who have really the right to stay here. But not everybody.\" Maria Ardagna, an ardent Salvini fan, believes in the \"great replacement\" conspiracy, a racist view with a long history. Ardagna believes there is a plot to replace white Europeans with black migrants. She believes the plotters are big names in international finance: \"Soros, Rockefeller, Rothschild.\" Like many other League voters, Ardagna is not a fan of Pope Francis, who recently warned that fearmongers have made people \"intolerant and, perhaps without realizing it, racist.\" \"He does un-Christian things,\" Ardagna says. \"When he travels and finds families in need, he doesn't bring Christians back to Rome, he brings Muslims. He's not a pope \u2014 for us, he's the anti-Christ.\" The victory party ends with a speech by a rising star, 32-year-old Susanna Ceccardi, elected as the League's first mayor in Tuscany in 2016, when she defeated the leftist candidate in Cascina. In one of her first moves, she scrapped government-funded projects to help migrants integrate in favor of hiring private guards as nighttime sentinels. She is greeted with applause as she tells the crowd she's sick and tired of the left accusing the League of being heartless. \"I strongly believe that bulldozing Roma camps and curbing illegal immigration by shutting down ports, as Salvini has done, are great humanitarian acts,\" she declares. In May, Ceccardi won a seat for the League in the European Parliament in Brussels. Next year, she plans to run for governor of the entire region of Tuscany.",

Lee Zeldin, R-N.Y., is a member. After President Trump attacked four progressive congresswomen in racist remarks last week, Republicans defending him often base their support on what they say is anti-Semitism \u2014 a familiar line of attack for the president as well. In a Tuesday appearance on Fox News, Rep. Lee Zeldin, R-N.Y., echoed Trump's anti-Israel accusations against the self-described \"squad\" of Democratic lawmakers. Referring to Reps. Ilhan Omar of Minnesota and Rashida Tlaib of Michigan in particular, Zeldin said, \"their hearts are filled with darkness\" and their legislation \"is filled with anti-Israel and anti-Semitic hatred.\" However, the conversation among Jews is much more nuanced than that. At the B'nai Israel Reform Temple on Long Island, where Zeldin is a member, congregants Karen Connor and Jerry Kessler are in a debate about Trump's rhetoric, often interrupting and finishing each other's sentences. \"He's allowed to free speech,\" Connor said of the president. Kessler interjects to say that it's not presidential. On the topic of  Omar, an American citizen who moved to the U.S. as a refugee from Somalia, the two are even more divided. \"She's so anti-Israel and anti-Jewish people,\" Connor said. Omar's previous comments questioning a pro-Israel lobby's influence in U.S. politics had been widely condemned as anti-Semitic. Critics also frequently fault her for not distancing herself from Hamas' threats to harm Jews. On Wednesday, Trump continued his charge of anti-Semitism against the congresswoman, saying, \"Omar has a history of launching vicious, anti-Semitic screeds.\" The debate between Kessler and Connor is friendly, but also forceful. In the end, Connor supports their congressman and fellow templegoer, while Kessler said Zeldin's refusal to disavow Trump's attacks against Omar could cost him the election. In response to criticism against Trump's remarks that the congresswomen, all U.S. citizens of color, should \"go back\" to where they came from, the president said, \"So sad to see the Democrats sticking up for people who speak so badly of our Country and who, in addition, hate Israel with a true and unbridled passion.\" Josh Franklin, a rabbi at the Jewish Center of the Hamptons, also located in Zeldin's district, said, \"You ask two Jews, as that joke goes, you'll get three opinions.\" Franklin supports Zeldin's confrontation with Omar, specifically after she made comments condemned as anti-Semitic, for which she later apologized. After her apology, the House passed a nonbinding resolution that condemned \"anti-Semitism, Islamophobia, racism and other forms of bigotry.\" Franklin said that resolution was \"watered down\" and turned Omar into \"the victim\" when she was supposed to be directly condemned for her anti-Semitic rhetoric. Twenty-three Republicans, including Zeldin, voted against the measure. \"I actually think he got it right and most of Congress got it wrong,\" Franklin said of Zeldin. \"I think that was a shameful day in Congress, and I think most of the Jewish community would agree with me.\" But Franklin also called the president's rhetoric offensive and inappropriate, and said that Jewish leaders need to step forward and say so. At the synagogue across the street, however, the opposite is happening. No one is talking. Several men and boys have gathered for afternoon prayers at the Chabad of the Hamptons. Most of them have strong views on the issue, but they are reluctant to say anything publicly. Some said speaking will only invite more hate. Another said the issue of Trump divides friendships. But Marc Ringel breaks the silence: \"Why are you so worried about tweets?\" He said the tweets are the problem. Trump's tweets, Omar's tweets \u2014 everyone is tweeting instead of having a thoughtful discussion. \"You got to have a debate,\" he said. \"One hundred and fifty characters is not a conversation.\"",

Steve Daines, R-Mont., tweeted in support of President Trump's racist comments directed at four congresswomen earlier this week. President Trump's racist tweets and comments are drawing support in Montana, where Trump won by 20 percentage points in the 2016 popular vote against Hillary Clinton. Sen. Steve Daines, Republican from Montana, tweeted in support of Trump on Monday, writing: \"Montanans are sick and tired of listening to anti-American, anti-Semite, radical Democrats trash our country and our ideals. This is America. We're the greatest country in the world. I stand with @realdonaldtrump.\" In a tweet on Sunday, the president called for four freshmen Democratic House members to \"go back and help fix the totally broken and crime infested places from which they came.\" Trump's series of tweets incorrectly states the women of color all came from other countries. Three were born in the United States, and all four are American citizens. Daines is running for re-election in 2020, and the Montana GOP featured his tweet in an fundraising email. Many Montanans who support Trump are joining Daines in standing with Trump. At Black Butte range in Billings, Mont., gunsmith Jerome Hall, a veteran who describes himself as a Trump supporter, says he thinks Trump's tweets and the reaction to them were funny, not racist. \"It just makes me giggle that everybody's all up in arms about this,\" he says. He doesn't think Trump made a racial comment, rather one about the places these congresswomen represent. \"Trump saying they need to go back to their country is pretty much him saying 'go back to California, go back to New York,' \" he says. He believes Trump may have misspoke and meant to say \"state\" instead of \"country.\" \"Social media is social media. Everybody takes it as the word of God, and it's not,\" he says. \"I post stupid stuff on Facebook all the time and that's because it's funny. I'm more worried about what he plans on spending the budget on. That's what I'm looking at. Where is he putting the money for the state? Is it going to stupid stuff, is it going to make the state better? Everything like that.\" As for Daines' support of Trump's comments, Hall says the senator was \"doing what he was hired to do by the police of Montana.\" \"The people that voted him in are now the ones saying he needs to leave because he supports Trump all because he supports Trump,\" Hall says. \"If it would have been a different candidate, then if Hillary would have posted that, everybody would be freaking out cheering her on.\" Montana native and Black Butte Range co-owner Andrew Stapleton doesn't agree with everything Trump does but says he saw the tweets as a criticism of the congresswomen's work in their own districts. \"Essentially, as I read this is 'Don't throw rocks if you live in a glass house,' \" he says. \"It just has to do with, go back and fix your areas, and then you can try to fix my area.\" Tanner Lineberry, who sells building supplies and stopped into the range, says Trump's comments and the reaction are just a distraction from the president's accomplishments. He praised Trump's work on the economy and foreign policy. And he agrees with Trump's tweets. \"It doesn't sound like [the congresswomen] really want to be here ... so, if they don't want to be here, they should probably go somewhere else.\" Lineberry says Trump will have his support in 2020, as long as the president doesn't go after gun rights. Many Montanans, however, are joining the outrage against Trump and including Daines in their criticism. Helena, Mont., Mayor Wilmot Collins, a Liberian refugee who's vying for the Democratic nomination to challenge Daines in 2020, tweeted, \"I served this country for over 20 years in the U.S. Armed Forces. Does @SteveDaines think I should 'go back to where I came from' too?\" Collins later posted a video recounting one of his early days in Montana, when he says a vandal spray-painted on his door, \"Go back to Africa.\" \"This kind of behavior is inevitable from vandals in the night, or anonymous online commenters, but not from a U.S. senator,\" Collins said. Collins is calling on Daines to apologize for questioning the loyalty of the four Democratic representatives. John Mues, a veteran and engineer from Loma also seeking the Democratic nod, called Daines a \"divider whose policies weaken America\" and likened him to regime leaders in North Korea and Saudi Arabia. Collins and Mues are using the tweet to leverage donations. Late Monday afternoon, Montana Democratic Sen. Jon Tester tweeted, \"We should be able to disagree on policy and politics without devolving into divisive, hateful rhetoric. President Trump's comments were reprehensible and far beneath the office of the presidency.\" An email sent from the Montana GOP account on Tuesday says the party and Daines stand behind the president's tweets. A spokesperson for Daines told Yellowstone Public Radio that Americans agree with Daines' take and that he values feedback from all Montanans.",

The Trump administration is swinging for a \"home run\" in the proposal it's crafting for peace between Israelis and Palestinians, but it isn't going to offer \"goodies\" to get the Palestinians to start negotiations, a key White House adviser told Ari Shapiro on NPR's All Things Considered. Special Representative for International Negotiations Jason Greenblatt is an assistant to President Trump and has traveled to the Mideast repeatedly over the past two years as part of the peace plan effort by Trump's senior adviser and son-in-law, Jared Kushner. In June, the White House released an investment plan for the Palestinian territories, but the money won't start flowing until there's progress on a political solution. That plan hasn't yet been unveiled. Jason Greenblatt (left) and Jared Kushner attended a Middle East peace meeting in February in Warsaw, Poland.\n                \n                    \n                    Sean Gallup/Getty Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption Jason Greenblatt (left) and Jared Kushner attended a Middle East peace meeting in February in Warsaw, Poland. People around the region are looking for the political plan to address the big questions, including whether there will be an independent Palestinian state, the status of Jerusalem, how to ensure security for Israel, what to do for Palestinian refugees and how to end Israel's military occupation of the West Bank. But progress has been slow. And the Palestinian leadership has broken off contacts to the Trump White House since the U.S. endorsed Israel's claim that Jerusalem is its capital and moved the U.S. Embassy there last year. The embassy move was just one of several times Trump's White House has sided against the Palestinians. It also closed the Palestinian representation office in Washington, D.C., and has cut hundreds of millions of dollars in aid to Palestinians, including for health clinics and food programs for impoverished people. Greenblatt and Kushner have promoted their plan as a break from the past, whether it succeeds or fails. Highlights of Greenblatt's interview with NPR, edited and condensed for clarity, follow. On building trust with the Palestinians so they will negotiate on a U.S. plan We would love to have a relationship of trust and confidence, which we do have with many, many ordinary Palestinians. But if the Palestinian leadership ... if they choose to cut us off to the detriment of their people and to the detriment of the possibility of peace, that's their choice. We aren't going to give them the so-called carrots or, you know, goodies in order to buy them to come to the table, because it's never worked before.

On promising investment to the Palestinians while simultaneously cutting U.S. aid If there's traction on the political engagement, once we reveal the political plan, then we will certainly look into restoring certain things and trying to improve lives along the way. It is very important to us to improve lives. But at the moment ... we have not only non-engagement but actually boycotts undermining ... all of our efforts. Insults hurled at the president, our ambassador to Israel, many members of the administration. It is not a wise use of U.S. taxpayer money to keep feeding into a system where there is no positive momentum. On criticism of the U.S. taking an all-or-nothing approach instead of confidence-building steps We are aiming for a comprehensive solution. The interim solutions have been tried before. ... I'm not saying we will hit the home run. But at the moment, we are aiming for the home run where we couple a very impressive economic plan that was created by Jared Kushner and a dedicated team here from the U.S. administration, as well as peer-reviewed by outsiders. It'll be stapled to a political plan. I think that's an important point, because I know that there's been a lot of criticism that we're trying to buy off the Palestinians, that we're trying to bribe the Palestinians, that there's no political plan. All of that is completely untrue. When everybody sees the two parts to the plan, I think it'll make sense to everybody. We're prepared to weather criticism from all sides. On the timing for unveiling the administration's proposal We obviously have the [September] Israeli election and government coalition formation looming, and the president hasn't made his decision yet [about releasing the plan]. We're protecting something very delicate. We want to make sure that it succeeds. So we want to air it at the right timing, and we will know the decision pretty soon. ... The plan is pretty much finished. On whether the plan will come before the 2020 U.S. election I think it would be a missed opportunity if we didn't. That's a long way off. On whether the Palestinians deserve to have independence the way Israelis have independence I would just say that you can't summarize such an extraordinarily complex conflict with the word \"independence.\" You can't summarize the conflict with the words \"two-state solution.\" There are just too many things, too many layers to this conflict to allow one- or three-word slogans or phrases to summarize the conflict. On the plan's framework The framework is essentially figuring out how to keep everybody, Israelis and Palestinians ... safe, secure, prosperous. Better lives. And what we've done is ... roughly a 60-page document, plus some exhibits that will allow everybody, from teenagers to much older people, to understand how we think the conflict can be resolved \u2014 with a lot of hard work, compromise and of course negotiation \u2014 and allow people to ask themselves the tough question of \"Will our lives be better off this way? Are we better off making these compromises so that once we sign\" \u2014 we the Palestinians, in this case \u2014 \"can create something unique and special and wildly successful?\" And with the Israelis, be able to continue to be successful but also feel safe and secure and accepted into the neighborhood that they live in, which is a rough and difficult neighborhood at times.",

Justin Amash, R-Mich., walks up the House steps of the Capitol for the final votes before the Memorial Day recess on Thursday, May 23, 2019. Updated on June 17 at 10:15 a.m. ET Justin Amash stands alone. The congressman from West Michigan is the only Republican in Congress to have called for impeachment proceedings against President Trump. On Wednesday, he was the only Republican to vote to hold Attorney General William Barr and Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross in contempt of Congress. And he's facing taunts and insults from other Republicans. In the politics of Washington, D.C., standing alone is rarely a good thing, maybe that's why so few politicians do it. But back home in Michigan, many people who know Amash say they're not surprised at all by his willingness to go against his own party \u2014 even if that decision costs him his seat in Congress. \"Five-year-old Justin Amash was a lot like 39-year-old Justin Amash is like,\" says Jordan Bush, who first met Amash when they were in kindergarten. Bush says Amash is diligent and intentional. Someone who doesn't bend his principles. Other longtime friends echo similar sentiments. In high school, Amash became known for always finishing his homework, even if it meant his friends had to wait to hang out. Amash eventually went on to become valedictorian. Amash's parents are both immigrants. His mother is originally from Syria. His father, Attallah, came to the United States in 1956 as a Christian refugee from Palestine. \"Justin just always had a keen sense of what was at stake in terms of what governments do or don't do, how much they interfere, how much they limit themselves,\" says Jessica Bratt Carle, who got to know Amash in high school. By the time Bratt Carle and Bush got to know the Amash family, they had built a successful family business, which they still own. \"I think a lot of that work ethic,\" Bush says, \"largely comes from his father.\" When Justin Amash got elected to Congress, Bush served in his district office. He says he saw the same person there that he did in kindergarten. \"Justin is the least surprising representative in Congress once you have an understanding of how he views his role,\" Bush says. That role, according to Bush, is to uphold the Constitution and protect individual liberty. Amash is known as one of the more libertarian members of Congress. Some have speculated Amash could even dump the Republican Party to run as the presidential candidate for the Libertarian Party. Amash has not ruled out that move. But for now, he remains in the Republican Party, despite his many disagreements with party leadership. When the 448-page report by former special counsel Robert Mueller was released to the public in April, Amash initially gave no comment. He posted on Twitter that he would read the report \"carefully and completely\" before saying anything. And for nearly a month, Amash said nothing. Then, in a string of tweets posted on May 18, Amash gave his conclusions from the report. Here are my principal conclusions:1. Attorney General Barr has deliberately misrepresented Mueller\u2019s report.2. President Trump has engaged in impeachable conduct.3. Partisanship has eroded our system of checks and balances.4. Few members of Congress have read the report. He said the report showed President Trump engaged in impeachable conduct and that Attorney General William Barr intentionally misled people about what's in the report. In response, the president tweeted that Amash is a \"loser\" and a lightweight.\" Not long after that, Amash held a town hall event in Grand Rapids, in an auditorium at his old high school, Grand Rapids Christian High School. \"I think it's really important that we do our job as a Congress, that we not allow misconduct to go undeterred,\" Amash said, to applause. \"That we not just say someone can violate the public trust and that there are no consequences to it.\" Amash answered questions for two hours that night. He got multiple standing ovations. But not from everyone. \"I think a lot of the people here that are cheering you and applauding your courage most likely a lot of them didn't vote for you,\" said Anna Timmer. \"I, on the other hand, have voted for you in every election since 2010. And, in fact, I worked on your first campaign in 2010. I knocked on hundreds of doors for you.\" Now, Timmer says, she's changed her mind. It's not just the impeachment talk. Timmer says she supports Trump. Amash never has. Timmer says it doesn't matter to her if Amash says he's standing on principle. \"You know, he's not sitting on the Supreme Court,\" Timmer says. \"His job is not to kind of drone on and on about tiny little, debatable portions of the Constitution that not everyone agrees with him on. His job is to represent us.\" And that is where Amash may face his biggest challenge in the next election. Not just over his stance on impeachment, but over whether he can get anything done as a representative, when his whole party is against him. \"Things have changed,\" says Andy Johnston, who's with the Grand Rapids Area Chamber of Commerce. The chamber backed a primary challenger against Amash in 2014. While Amash won that race, Johnston says he may not this time. \"Some would say he's vulnerable at this point,\" Johnston says. \"He got elected during a Tea Party swell. That tea party is now, you know, the party of Trump in many ways.\" Two Republican challengers have already announced that they'll run against Amash in the next primary. On Thursday, Donald Trump Jr. tweeted results of a recent poll showing one of those challengers, state Rep. Jim Lower, leading Amash in the district. \"See you soon Justin... I hear Michigan is beautiful during primary season,\" tweeted Trump Jr. Amash's account retweeted it with the comment: \"if it's what you say I love it especially later in the summer,\" a reference to an email Donald Trump Jr. sent when someone reached out to him in the summer of 2016 offering dirt on Hillary Clinton as \"part of Russia and its government's support of Mr. Trump.\" The email and the meeting that came out of it were described in the report by Mueller and his team. Trump Jr. says nothing came of the meeting, and the president has defended his son's actions. Amash has said he's not afraid of losing his seat in the next election. He notes he performed better in the district in 2016 than Trump. But Amash has lost many of his former political allies since that election. This week, CNN reported Amash has stepped down from the House Freedom Caucus, a group he helped found. The conservative Club for Growth, which supported him in previous elections, distanced itself from his comments on Trump's conduct. Amash has also lost the support of the powerful, and wealthy DeVos family. Many of the family members have homes in Amash's district. Amash has connections to the family going all the way back to his high school days. No other prominent Republicans have yet publicly come to Amash's defense. So for now, Amash remains alone in his own party.",

            "article_content": "Far-right wins in Sunday's EU parliament elections produced more of a strong ripple than a wave, but the centrist coalition that has governed for 40 years did lose its majority.  MARY LOUISE KELLY, HOST: The elections for the EU Parliament are over. The results are in, and the dust is settling. There was not a massive far-right populist wave as many had predicted, though populist wins did cause - call it a strong ripple. And the coalition of mainstream centrist parties lost the majority after dominating the European Union for the last 40 years. NPR's Eleanor Beardsley is in Paris, and she begins our coverage. ELEANOR BEARDSLEY, BYLINE: In France, the European Parliament election was also about President Emmanuel Macron. The fervently pro-EU leader invested hugely and personally in the campaign. So when Marine Le Pen's National Rally narrowly beat Macron's party, she used her victory speech to press for change at home. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) MARINE LE PEN: (Speaking French). BEARDSLEY: Le Pen demanded that Macron dissolve the French National Assembly to reflect the new reality. The elections for the EU Parliament had implications for domestic politics in many countries. In Britain, where the Brexit Party added 24 seats while the mainstream Tories and Labour were pummeled, Nigel Farage called the vote a mandate for a hard Brexit now. Turnout was more than 50% across the EU, the biggest in 25 years. At this polling station in Paris, 30-year-old physiotherapist Jean Baptiste Perche (ph) said he felt a sense of duty. JEAN BAPTISTE PERCHE: You can't judge what's going on in Europe if you don't vote, so I think it's important. BEARDSLEY: Green parties made huge gains, and environmentalists are now the third largest bloc in the Parliament. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) MATTEO SALVINI: (Speaking Italian). BEARDSLEY: As expected, Deputy Prime Minister Matteo Salvini's right-wing League came in first place in Italy. The populist darling aims to bring Europe's far-right together. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) SALVINI: (Speaking Italian). BEARDSLEY: \"The vote shows the rules must change,\" he said. \"A new Europe is born, one that is tired of the elites being in power and of finance and multinationals.\" But European Union expert Douglas Webber doesn't believe the disparate Euroskeptic parties will be able to come together to make big change. He says they don't agree about relations with Russia, free markets or even about migration. DOUGLAS WEBBER: For example, Italy would like other member states to take more of the refugees that are currently in Italy. But governments, such as that of Mr. Orban in Hungary, of course, are opposed to this. BEARDSLEY: Webber says the new parliament, now more fragmented, will have to build new coalitions and alliances to govern. Eleanor Beardsley, NPR News, Paris. Copyright \u00a9 2019 NPR.

A lawyer and her future son-in-law argue furiously about politics on Facebook, each accusing the other of ignoring \"the facts.\" A newly married couple gets into an uncomfortably heated argument as they watch the confirmation hearings of then-Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh, until one finally leaves the room. \"I love you, but you're wrong,\" she says. A Mexican-American college student argues with her Trump-supporting mother \u2014 also Mexican-American \u2014 about how she could possibly accept the idea of a border wall. These, of course, are not isolated stories: Political differences can drive a wedge through even the closest families and friendships. A 2017 Reuters/Ipsos poll found that 13 percent of respondents said the 2016 election had caused them to end a relationship with a friend or relative. Nearly 40 percent said the election had provoked at least one argument with a loved one. More broadly, Americans say they're worried that the United States is growing more polarized and that civility \u2014 respect, courtesy, kindness \u2014 is slipping away in many aspects of their lives. From road rage to Twitter feuds to the rancor at the highest levels of government, polls show that Americans think incivility is at crisis levels. Recently, NPR has been traveling the country to explore how people are grappling with the idea of civility in polarizing times. Here are five stories about the shaky line that people walk to keep things civil \u2014 or not \u2014 in their most intimate relationships. When Patricia \"P.\" Price met Simone Perry in 2016, she was surprised when Simone told her she was Republican. As P. explains, \"Black, lesbian and Republican \u2014 it doesn't go in the same sentence.\" They got married a year later, and Simone Perry became Simone Price. Loading... Simone, who initially supported Ted Cruz and voted for Gary Johnson in 2016, says P. is more interested in \"how I carry myself and how I treat people than who I support politically.\" P., a Democrat who voted for Hillary Clinton, says Simone is much more engaged in politics than she is and wins 90 percent of their political debates. But several months ago, a debate flared into a fight that P. was not willing to concede. The confirmation hearings for Kavanaugh's nomination to the Supreme Court were on TV, and P. says she was \"completely turned off\" by his demeanor. Simone, on the other hand, sympathized with Kavanaugh's need to defend himself. She remembers asking P., \"If someone we love is ever accused of something, are we going to grant them the benefit of the doubt?\" The argument got angry, uncomfortable. Both women say they often use prayer or meditation to calm themselves if they're fighting, but this political moment called for more immediate action: When P. felt she couldn't take it anymore, she walked out and went upstairs. Christopher Kilpatrick and Cheryl Hume are about as politically different as two people can be. Chris, 38, describes himself as a \"far-right kind of guy\" who voted for Trump. Cheryl, his 58-year-old future mother-in-law, voted for Hillary Clinton and donates to causes like refugee resettlement and prisoner re-entry programs. They see each other only a few times a year but connect frequently on Facebook, where they clash over everything from Trump's border wall to the latest conspiracy theory. Christopher Kilpatrick and Cheryl Hume in Lansford, Pa.\n                \n                    \n                    Hannah Yoon for NPR\n                    \n                \nhide caption Christopher Kilpatrick and Cheryl Hume in Lansford, Pa. Their back-and-forth can get barbed \u2014 they sometimes attack each other for being ignorant \u2014 but before things get too nasty, one of them changes the subject. \"How's Kathy doing?\" Cheryl might ask. Kathy is Chris' fianc\u00e9e and Cheryl's foster daughter. Both Chris and Cheryl say it's their mutual love for Kathy that helps them put their political differences in perspective. When the family gets together, Chris and Cheryl say, they avoid talking politics, partly to spare Kathy the misery of playing referee, but partly, they say, because they genuinely enjoy each other's company. Chris calls Cheryl \"big hearted,\" and Cheryl describes Chris as a \"good guy.\" But when they return home from a family gathering, Chris and Cheryl retreat to their respective corners on social media and resume sparring. Happily for them, Kathy doesn't pay that much attention to Facebook. Loading... Lorraine Bank, 67, says she thinks her children were raised right and \"instilled with good values.\" But somewhere along the way \u2014 through school, TV or the workplace \u2014 she thinks her two daughters \"got brainwashed.\" Politically, the sisters lean liberal, while Lorraine is a staunch conservative. She says she and her husband mention Trump often enough so their children \"know we think he's a good president, but we don't rub it in.\" That's not always enough for daughter Valerie, 28, who voted for Clinton in 2016. She says she has to steel herself when she visits her parents. \"I do breathing exercises,\" she says. \"Before I get into a conversation, I give myself a pep talk and say, 'I'm going to keep calm, I'm not going to engage, and if someone tries to bait me, I'm not going to take the bait.' \" Sometimes she has a few drinks to calm herself down. If all else fails, she leaves the room. For the past few years, Valerie has had to deal with an additional family stress: Her older sister, Sarah, stopped talking to their mother after a serious fight. (Sarah declined to participate in this story.) As their mother, Lorraine, tells it, after a series of political disagreements, she and Sarah got into a \"final straw\" argument about gay marriage shortly before the 2016 election. At one point, Lorraine referred to gay people as \"fags,\" and although she says she later apologized, Sarah still refuses to speak to her. \"I pray every day that whatever is wrong, she can get over it and she'll wake up and know we still love her,\" Lorraine says. Now, on the few family occasions where everyone is together, Sarah won't interact directly with her mother. Valerie plays the reluctant mediator, trying to knit together a conversation between two people who can no longer find the words. Loading... In 2016, Michael Beale and Francesco Mazza were assigned to be freshman roommates at High Point University in North Carolina. And before they met, they each formed an instant impression of the other. Michael Beale (left) and Francesco Mazza in High Point, N.C.\n                \n                    \n                    Phyllis B.

Michael remembers that Francesco was wearing a bright red \"Make America Great Again\" hat in his Facebook profile photo. \"And I thought to myself, 'Oh crap, I gotta live with this kid for a year,' \" Michael says. Francesco recalls that Michael's Facebook page had a picture of Bob Marley on it. \"So I'm like, 'Jesus, Mary and Joseph, he's probably like some hippie liberal,' \" Francesco recalls. (Michael actually voted for Libertarian Gary Johnson. And for the record, he doesn't remember a Bob Marley picture: \"It was probably me at a Grateful Dead concert,\" he says.) Despite their respective knee-jerk reactions, both men decided to approach the year with open-mindedness \u2014 a trait that helped them avoid arguments and eventually build a friendship that has sustained to this day. Now 21-year-old juniors, the two recently returned from a spring break trip to Florida. And almost since the day they met, they haven't been afraid to debate politics. \"Michael will ask how I think Trump is doing,\" says Francesco. \"If I think he's doing something stupid, I'll say so.\" Francesco, the son of a police officer, grew up around guns in Norristown, Pa. Michael was raised in Connecticut near Sandy Hook Elementary School, where a devastating mass shooting made him wonder why anyone would own a gun. Whenever there's a shooting in the news, they find themselves going back and forth about gun policy. Like many of their political debates, these conversations can be eye-opening \u2014 but rarely, they admit, mind changing. Loading... Nancy Richer, a 55-year-old Mexican-American, was born in Texas and spent half of her life in Mexico. Her daughter, Daniela Garduno, 19, was born in Mexico but grew up mostly north of the border. Each woman says she feels a stronger pull to one side of the Mexican-American hyphen: Nancy identifies more with her American side, Daniela with her Mexican side. Loading... And that can cause tension. Daniela is against the border wall, while her mother supports it. Nancy says she is proud of her older friends who went through the immigration process legally: \"They had to wait 18 years. They had to pay. They had to go through all the process,\" she says. \"Why not the others?\" Daniela says she's confused that her mother, a Trump supporter, \"can be Mexican and at the same time advocate for rights that are very anti-immigrant, anti-Latino.\" She says she sometimes regrets that she and her mother aren't more politically aligned and can't have the relaxed, head-nodding conversations that some of her school friends have with their parents. At the same time, both mother and daughter say they try to be respectful of each other's opinions, which helps keep their political arguments to a gentle roar. \"When I'm having these issues with my mom,\" Daniela says, \"I'll distance myself from the political part of it \u2014 I separate my mother from the politics.\" Of her daughter, Nancy says, \"When I see that she's responding as if I'm attacking her \u2014 instead of her points of view \u2014 that's when I stop. ... We go slowly, trying not to hurt each other.\"",

NPR reporting on the crisis in Venezuela over the last several months has raised an outsized number of complaints. Are listeners getting the fullest picture of the political turmoil and its contributing factors? Is NPR directly or indirectly, as some listeners believe, helping make the case for White House intervention in the political affairs of another country? This office looked back at several months of the coverage of the international story. The reporting is ongoing: NPR's All Things Considered sent a team to the Venezuelan/Colombian border in March for a series of in-depth reports that continues to air this week. For some audience members, these reports only addressed one concern among many, and sparked some new ones. Venezuela's is a complex crisis to follow, involving internal constitutional maneuvering, years of financial mismanagement, and, layered on top, worldwide political jockeying tied to the country's vast oil reserves. In January, military-backed President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro prepared for his second inauguration following an election victory overcast by allegations of fraud. Days before the swearing-in, Venezuelan National Assembly leader Juan Guaid\u00f3 declared himself the country's president, invoking a special clause in the constitution. The U.S. was among the first countries to back Guaid\u00f3. Since then, many other countries have acknowledged Guaid\u00f3 as the leader of Venezuela, including the Lima Group (11 other regional countries, plus Canada) and members of the European Union. (Maduro still has support from China and Russia.) Venezuela's extraordinarily high inflation rate and troubled economy are not new: NPR has covered these stories for years. But, as the inflation rate continues to rise in the country with the most oil reserves in the world (more on that later), many readers insist that NPR is not doing enough to tell the complete story. As one audience member wrote to the Public Editor's office, \"You offer little in the way of history, explaining the economic conditions that prevailed prior to the Bolivarian revolution that placed former military commander Hugo Chavez in office, and even less about the positive reforms the Chavez administration put in place.\" In effect, this listener (joined by many others) is criticizing specific aspects of NPR's coverage rather than its entirety. Since January, NPR has run more than 200 stories about the country online and in the morning and evening newsmagazines. An assessment of the body of NPR's Venezuela coverage shows many stories that put the current events into historical context. To cite just a couple: NPR's Carrie Kahn and Alex Leff reported that in the last century, the U.S. has participated in Latin American regime changes 40 times. And a recent episode of Planet Money's \"The Indicator\" used Venezuela's current hunger crisis to look at the last two decades of Venezuela's pivot to depending on an economy underpinned by oil \u2014 a move put in motion by Chavez. But unlike text stories on the Web, radio reporter pieces and live interviews are bound by strict time limits, which sometimes leaves audience members frustrated at the lack of context included. Time is tight. A two-minute story can cover the day's news, but does not allow for an explanation of the contributing factors of the last 50 years. That's no different than when NPR covers any other complex ongoing story. But there's a broader issue, too. NPR's Will Dobson, supervising senior editor on the international desk, said that along with time constraints on radio reporting, the challenge lies with a \"disagreed history.\" While the facts surrounding Venezuela's historical events are straightforward, the interpretation of these events is not. For example, many listeners have complained about NPR's use of the phrase \"self-proclaimed president\" to refer to Guaid\u00f3, with some audience members criticizing the \"self-proclaimed\" portion and others questioning anything that seems like NPR's affirmation of Guaid\u00f3 as \"president.\" \"It's not [about] giving context,\" said Dobson of the criticism. \"It's reconciling world views.\" One newsmagazine piece that drew feedback from audience members was NPR's interview of special envoy Elliott Abrams, President Trump's appointee to handle matters in Venezuela. Prior to that interview, NPR covered a House committee hearing where lawmakers asked Abrams about his involvement in the Iran-Contra affair more than three decades ago. During February and March, NPR heard from Latin America experts who argued that U.S. military intervention would not lead to the regime change the Trump administration supports. In the Abrams interview alone, the full picture might have been difficult to see. Abrams was asked about and laid out, sometimes vaguely, the administration's strategy in Venezuela. His controversial past was acknowledged as a point of contention at the end of the interview. Abrams offered one point of view \u2014 one that many listeners disagree with, vehemently \u2014 and the interview was conducted respectfully, which is NPR's style. NPR interviews of political figures and government officials such as Abrams are necessary. They help listeners understand the whole picture and get officials on the record about their actions. A broader theme running through the many audience concerns is the assumption that the Trump administration is preparing to invade Venezuela \u2014 and that NPR's reporting of the situation echoes the lack of critical media coverage prior to the 2003 invasion of Iraq. All Things Considered's Ari Shapiro told me that this history was actually a central reason for the newsmagazine's reporting trip to Colombia's border with Venezuela. The teams' stories, some of which ran a lengthy 11-plus minutes, have taken different vantage points: a pregnant woman seeking medical assistance across the Venezuelan border in Colombia; the young men ready to overthrow Maduro using violence; and the perilous journey of the caminantes \u2014 those walking hundreds of miles to flee Venezuela. \"It's the biggest refugee crisis outside of Syria,\" said Shapiro. \"And there are concerns that it could be the next U.S. military intervention.\" To prepare for the trip, the reporting team conducted dozens of background interviews, seeking input from professors, other journalists, government officials, people in Venezuela and more. \"For this, we wanted to hear the voices on the ground,\" said Shapiro. \"We wanted to bring listeners to a place and let them experience what it was like being in the city of C\u00facuta, being on the road to Bogota with the walkers, the 'caminantes.' We wanted to bring a lot of rich voices and sounds.\" Some listeners said that by highlighting the humanitarian crisis, NPR was in effect adding support to the Trump administration's efforts to oust Maduro. But these kinds of eyewitness reports are crucial for the audience to fully understand the situation. A final point of criticism levied against NPR is the range of voices represented. NPR audience member Nancy Slator of Western Massachusetts wrote: \"Day after day the programs interview anti-Maduro people, and I have never heard from the side that supports Maduro. The anti-Maduro people freely say the pro-Maduro people are corrupt, and the hosts just agree with them rather than reporting evidence on the question.\" While no listener can hear every report, opposition voices have outnumbered those of Maduro supporters in NPR's reporting. But NPR's Philip Reeves, who covers Latin America, has pulled in a few pro-Maduro voices, including a member of the civilian militia, a former banker and a retired member of Venezuela's National Guard. And NPR's Eyder Peralta has also included voices from inside the Venezuelan government and of Chavez supporters. The reason for any imbalance is not, as some listeners argued, that NPR doesn't want to report what Maduro's supporters have to say. \"That's the most fascinating part of the story here,\" said Dobson. \"We want to plunge the depths of the pro-Maduro supporters.\" But Dobson said NPR's responsibility to keep its journalists and sources safe is the top priority, and reporting safely from Venezuela is extremely difficult. Venezuela ranks 143 out of 180 countries in press freedom, with journalists risking violence at the hands of the state and some of its supporters. New York Times journalist Nicholas Casey spoke about the challenges last week on Fresh Air, and some local journalists have moved their base to Colombia to continue operating safely. In approaching NPR's coverage of Venezuela, it's important to acknowledge that there are many storylines and facts that are not mutually exclusive: Maduro's repression of the opposition, the Venezuelan economy in free fall, a long history of U.S. intervention in Latin American affairs, oil sanctions imposed by the U.S. and its subsequent backing of opposition leader Guaid\u00f3 \u2014 all of this exists simultaneously. So, reporting on allegations of crimes against humanity in Venezuela has not stopped NPR from simultaneously reporting on the moves of the U.S. government. The U.S. is Venezuela's biggest oil customer. Under the Obama and Trump administrations, the U.S. placed sanctions on Venezuelan oil, adding to Venezuela's declining economy. In January, U.S. Treasury Department announced sanctions that virtually stopped imports from the Latin American country completely. The question becomes whether reporting through interviews to hear from those directly involved is conducive to communicating every fact that the audience needs to know in the time available for radio reports. What level of knowledge should NPR expect a typical audience member to have about the situation?  How can reporting of current news also take account of decades of historical context surrounding U.S. intervention in Latin America? The answer to the last question is: It depends. Back to chief international desk editor Will Dobson: \"Sometimes the history can be included in pieces of greater length, and sometimes that isn't possible.\" I think NPR's body of coverage for Venezuela is composed of quality work. The reporting from Caracas and the Venezuelan-Colombian border has been strong and added to the audience's understanding of a complex story. NPR's breaking news on in-country events has not always been expeditious. For example, the npr.org story on the first massive power outage in Venezuela came some 18 hours after the reported incident. But the next day's reporting offered an in-depth look at events that went beyond a breaking-news banner with a few thin paragraphs. A large portion of the concerns audience members have expressed to this office are calls for NPR to adhere to the basic tenets of journalism: completeness, fairness and independence, which are all described in NPR's Ethics Handbook. And when reporting on a country where the press is openly threatened, the need for this high-quality journalism is even greater. But to produce it, journalists have to be safe, and media organizations have to be responsible. Reviewing NPR's coverage of Venezuela, it's clear to me that neither the U.S. nor the Venezuelan government represents the dichotomy of \"good\" and \"bad.\" The history is messy and the current events are getting messier. While it may be easier for some to see those two parties as representing such a dichotomy, it doesn't do justice to the realities at play and to the Venezuelans whose lives are affected by the crisis in that troubled country.

Venezuelans have been suffering one calamity after the next, but in recent weeks, much of Venezuela has had to go long stretches without electricity. New York Times journalist Nicholas Casey was in Maracaibo, Venezuela, in March when the country was hit by a six-day blackout, considered at the time the worst in Venezuela's history. He says people initially assumed that the outage had been planned and that power would be restored after a few hours. But as hours stretched into days, the country fell into chaos. \"By the fourth day of the power outage, that was when you started to hear shots getting fired in the street,\" Casey says. \"People were beginning to loot, and the store owners were coming out to defend their stores.\" As Andes bureau chief for the Times, Casey has been covering the deepening economic and political chaos in Venezuela. He says the current crisis in the country is \"almost unimaginable.\" \"This is an oil-producing country. This was one of the most wealthy countries in Latin America,\" he says. \"And now this is a place where there are shortages of food, shortages of medicine. People's daily lives are spent trying to figure out how they're going to get basic things like eggs or coffee.\" Casey notes that Venezuelan President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro, who took over after the 2013 death of Hugo Ch\u00e1vez, has become increasingly authoritarian, imprisoning political rivals and cracking down on protesters. Maduro has also cut off access for journalists, including Casey. \"The government doesn't allow me to live in Venezuela anymore. I lived there in 2016, and by the end of the year, my visa was revoked,\" Casey says. \"Their reaction to the stories that I've had \u2014 it's been terrible sometimes. Anything that they see that doesn't line up with their view of what's happening in the country they consider to be a lie.\" On Venezuelans leaving their country because of the chaos The U.N. estimates that it's upwards of 3 million people who have left. Now remember, this is a country of 30 million people. So we're talking about 10 percent of the population that has gone. And you see this when you walk around the streets of Caracas, which I have, or Maracaibo, which I did just a few weeks ago. There are areas which are completely empty. You walk down streets and you see that there's two or three people in one house, and then another house is gone, or another house has got a family of what looked like squatters, because they've just moved into the place. On what the journey to leave Venezuela is like So when you decide to leave, you usually say goodbye to your family, but there's no way of getting a flight, because you can't afford that. So for the most part, people take a bus using the bol\u00edvar, the currency that they have. Now the bol\u00edvars are worth money in Venezuela, but once you cross the border, they are almost worth nothing. So you're essentially bankrupt the moment that you cross into Colombia. ... And at that point you have to figure out how you're going to get somewhere. And that usually means you're going to walk, and often Venezuelans will spend a few days on the border, but then they keep moving, because there are so many Venezuelans in these border towns. There's no jobs for them there, so people set off on foot. They have usually a suitcase, backpacks, but they're trying to travel very light, because they know that they're going to have to carry everything on their backs that they're bringing, and hitching rides occasionally. Sometimes they can save a little bit of money to take a bus ride a short distance, but basically they are trying to put as many footsteps between them and Venezuela as they can. And it can be an extremely long process to try to travel these countries; these are very mountainous countries on foot. On how neighboring countries are responding to the millions of migrants On one end, these countries are trying to pressure [President] Maduro now to step down, because they know that this migrant crisis is going to get even worse the more politically unstable the country gets. Countries like Colombia understand that Venezuela used to be a country that took their immigrants, especially during the darkest days of the paramilitaries and the guerrilla fighting, but at the same time, they understand they can't take every Venezuelan that comes. And not only that, because of this crisis that's getting worse and worse, because of lack of medicine mainly, people are coming into these countries with diseases that should be controlled in Venezuela \u2014 diseases like diphtheria, malaria, tuberculosis have made a huge comeback in Venezuela. So if you're a neighboring country like Brazil or Colombia or a country like Ecuador or Peru, who are farther away but are also taking immigrants, this is a very scary situation that's right on your doorstep. On how President Maduro forced visiting Cuban doctors to use access to medicine as a way to gain votes for Maduro right before an election They would start by going house to house to people. ... The way that it was being described to me was that essentially you would start by handing people medications that they needed, especially seeing if they had chronic illnesses that they really needed medication for on a regular basis. And then after you start to get their trust, you would start to bring up Maduro. You'd start to bring up politics. You'd ask them, \"Are you registered to vote?\" And then actually start to make a much harder pitch, like \"You need to vote for Maduro. This is where this medicine is coming from,\" and ultimately at the end of this there would be a threat, which is that \"If you don't vote for Maduro, there is a possibility that you will lose your medication. You will lose your free health care.\" And this is what all of the doctors that I talked to said. ... The further along that you got, the less popular that Maduro was becoming, the more that you began to see that he was leaning on this medical system to try to drive votes. Nicholas Casey, Andes bureau chief, New York Times The further along that you got, the less popular that Maduro was becoming, the more that you began to see that he was leaning on this medical system to try to drive votes. In one election in 2015, there was a doctor who said that when it appeared that the opposition was ahead in a legislative vote, that they actually not only saw the doctors out that afternoon to try to get people to go vote, [but] they also dressed other people up, who were not doctors, as doctors and gave them medicine to go get people to vote, to try to get them to trust these doctors to go and vote. In the last elections that were taking place in 2017 and 2018, there was a doctor who was explaining to me about how he was in a small town and wasn't able to give medication to certain patients that were from the opposition and also was told to withhold things like oxygen tanks and not put them out early in the year because they wanted to bring out all the medicine and the oxygen tanks, which were largely in shortage, just before the election, just before people were going to vote, essentially to give the impression that Maduro had solved this medical crisis before people had to go vote for him again. One reason to be optimistic that Venezuela will recover I think there's a way out, and Venezuela, we have to remember, has lots of oil. So no matter how bad the economic crisis is, if there is a way out of the political crisis, there is a way for the country to be able to produce the money that it needs to be able to get back on its feet again. Unlike many other countries in the world, it's extremely blessed to have this natural resource there. But the way out is to have an election. People need to be able to choose who their leader is, because until that can happen, whoever is in charge \u2014 whether it's Juan Guaid\u00f3 saying that he is the president or Nicol\u00e1s Maduro saying that he is the president \u2014 isn't going to have the legitimacy to do anything about it. Venezuelans ultimately need to be able to choose who's going to be their leader, and they might choose someone again from the left. After all these years, I'm not sure that that's what they're going to do, but they need to be able to have a choice between a number of parties from the opposition and whoever Maduro would put as his candidate, and whoever wins can then take the next steps. Now, it's not going to be a fast process. This is something that's going to take years, to rebuild this country. But it's not necessarily the level I think always of devastation that makes people feel the worst. It's the fact that things are getting worse every day. Even if things were at a low point in Venezuela, if people could see that there was a reason for hope that things were starting to get better, I think you would start to see people coming back to Venezuela.

A second member of his Cabinet resigned Monday over allegations that he tried to influence a criminal prosecution. Since taking office in 2015, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has become a progressive icon due to his Liberal Party's championing of climate change action and refugee rights, as well as Trudeau's youthful looks and often charming demeanor. Now Trudeau is embroiled in an escalating scandal that has triggered the resignations of his own principal secretary, a kind of senior political adviser, as well as two top Cabinet members, the second one stepping down on Monday. The first Cabinet officer was former Attorney General Jody Wilson-Raybould, who has accused Trudeau of secretly attempting to direct her handling of a high-level criminal prosecution. \"I experienced a consistent and sustained effort by many people within the government to seek to politically interfere in the exercise of prosecutorial discretion,\" Wilson-Raybould told a parliamentary committee on Feb. 27.

The Montreal-based company faces criminal charges that it engaged in a long-term bribery and corruption scheme in Libya that involved funneling tens of millions of dollars to the family of former dictator Moammar Gadhafi. At issue is the prosecution of a Montreal-based engineering firm called SNC Lavalin, which has more than 50,000 employees worldwide. The company faces criminal charges that it engaged in a long-term bribery and corruption scheme in Libya that involved funneling tens of millions of dollars to the family of former dictator Moammar Gadhafi. If found guilty, the company could be banned from bidding on federal contracts in Canada. Last month, the Globe & Mail published an investigative report claiming Trudeau intervened in the matter, an account Wilson-Raybould corroborated. In her testimony, she said members of Trudeau's team pressured her repeatedly over a period of months in 2018 to reach a negotiated settlement with SNC Lavalin. Their goal, she said, was to protect jobs while also bolstering the Liberal Party's political standing in the province of Quebec ahead of next October's general election.

On Monday, a second minister, Jane Philpott, stepped down from her post as Canada's Treasury Board president. \"It is a fundamental doctrine of the rule of law that our attorney-general should not be subjected to political pressure or interference regarding the exercise of her prosecutorial discretion in criminal cases,\" Philpott wrote in a letter to Trudeau. The leader of Canada's Conservative opposition, Andrew Scheer, has been a frequent critic of Trudeau. Scheer is demanding a criminal probe of Trudeau's actions by the Royal Canadian Mounted Police and has urged the prime minister to resign. \"Justin Trudeau simply cannot continue to govern this country now that Canadians know what he has done,\" Scheer told reporters. Trudeau has defended his government's actions. During a news conference Monday, he said his staff advocated for the interests of an important Canadian jobs provider, while also respecting the rule of law. \"Canadians expect us to do those two things at the same time and that's what we will always do,\" Trudeau said. But with national elections scheduled for the fall, the scandal shows no sign of abating. This week, Canada's most influential news magazine, Maclean's, published an article about the affair titled \"Justin Trudeau, Imposter.\" The prime minister's former close confidante and political adviser, Gerry Butts, is scheduled to testify about his role in the Lavalin matter before a parliament committee on Wednesday. \"There is quite a bit of damage to Trudeau's brand,\" said Daniel B\u00e9land, a political science professor at McGill University in Montreal. \"He said he would change politics, and in the end he's just a politician like any other.\"",

Vice President Pence traveled to Bogot\u00e1, Colombia, on Monday and urged regional leaders to support Juan Guaid\u00f3, the self-proclaimed interim president of Venezuela, vowing that the U.S. will stand with the opposition leader \"until your libertad is restored.\" Pence also announced U.S. sanctions against several border-state governors aligned with embattled Venezuelan President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro who are said to be involved in blocking shipments of humanitarian aid from reaching Venezuelans. Military forces have prevented most of the food and medicine from crossing the country's borders with Brazil and Colombia. Clashes with protesters and volunteers trying to unload truckloads of aid resulted in the deaths of least four people this weekend. Hundreds more were wounded. Trucks carrying items were torched, amid tear gas fired by the military and attacks waged by paramilitary groups, as NPR has reported. \"Just days ago, as the world watched, the tyrant in Caracas danced as his henchmen burned truckloads of food and medicine, and murdered civilians,\" Pence said in remarks to members of the Lima Group, a coalition of nations formed to address the Venezuela turmoil. \"Saturday was a tragic day for the families of those who lost their lives and we mourn for those who mourn,\" Pence said. \"It was also a tragic day for the suffering people of Venezuela, but it was also just one more day in Venezuela's long and inevitable journey from tyranny to freedom.\" Maduro's government, however, views the aid shipments as a pretext for foreign invasion. Guaid\u00f3 and other opposition leaders had hoped the aid would loosen Maduro's grip on the country. Under the socialist regime, the once prospering country has suffered massive inflation and well as shortages of food and medicine. Millions of desperate Venezuelans have fled the country. If Maduro remains in charge of Venezuela, Pence said he expects it will result in two million more refugees. Pence noted Monday that the U.S. has sent five military transport aircraft carrying 400 tons of food and medicine to Colombia and Brazil in the past two weeks \u2014 and that those efforts will only increase. New areas along Venezuela's borders, he said, are being identified to prepare for the delivery of additional aid. The vice president said the U.S. has provided more than $139 million in aid to Venezuela's people, and will provide $56 million to support U.S. partners in the region. In his speech, Pence also appealed to armed forces loyal to Maduro, echoing President Trump's recent warning that those who chose Maduro over Guaid\u00f3 \"will find no safe harbor, no easy exit and no way out. You will lose everything.\" Nearly 200 members of the military have already defected, said Pence, who later met with dozens of families who had fled Venezuela. He gave the Lima Group nations specific steps they should take to isolate and shun Maduro: immediately freeze the assets of PDVSA, Venezuela's state-owned oil company, and transfer ownership of Venezuelan assets from Maduro's government to Guaid\u00f3's. The U.S. has already imposed sanctions on PDVSA and on officials with Maduro's government. The additional sanctions announced Monday, according to the Treasury Department, target \"the Governors of four Venezuelan states involved in endemic corruption and in blocking the delivery of critical humanitarian aid, thereby exacerbating the ongoing humanitarian crisis caused by the illegitimate Maduro regime.\" Pence said that \"even stronger sanctions\" will be announced in the days ahead \"against the regime's corrupt financial networks.\" U.S. officials have repeatedly said that all options, including military action, are on the table to try to remove Maduro.

To attend Monday's meeting in Bogot\u00e1, Guaid\u00f3 defied a travel ban that Maduro's government has imposed on him. He delivered a speech in which he thanked leaders for their support of Venezuela's democratic cause and humanitarian aid. He then asked for a minute of silence to reflect on Saturday's brutality. \"You saw in one day how sadistic they were when they torched the medicines and food in front of people who are hungry, people in dire need of medicine. The entire world saw what Venezuela has been enduring for years,\" Guaid\u00f3 said. The 35-year-old opposition leader was recently elected head of Venezuela's National Assembly, and grabbed the world stage in January by taking the oath of office in Caracas and declaring himself interim president. His announcement was met by swift support from the United States and several other nations. Maduro had recently been sworn in for a second term, and Guaid\u00f3 argued that the presidential election was illegitimate, plagued by corruption and repression. Before Monday's meeting, some Venezuelans indicated that Guaid\u00f3 might make a bid for the use of force against Maduro when meeting with Pence. They will \"demand an escalation in diplomatic pressure and in the use of force against the dictatorship,\" politician Julio Borges said Sunday. One local government worker told NPR that the unrest has left people tired and frustrated. \"If they tell us to be out on the streets for 30 days without eating to oust this government, we'd all be out there,\" said Carolina, who refused to give her last name for fear of losing her job. She added that impoverished Venezuelans have reached a breaking point but that the opposition was moving too slowly.",

Gen. Robert Ashley, director of the Defense Intelligence Agency, arrive to testify before the Senate intelligence committee on Capitol Hill on Tuesday. Updated at 12:22 p.m. ET President Trump governs despite what his national security advisers tell him, and he doesn't care who knows it. Trump on Wednesday rejected testimony by his top intelligence chiefs in which they said that, among other things, Iran is still technically complying with the terms of the nuclear agreement from which he withdrew the United States. Comments like that by CIA Director Gina Haspel are \"naive,\" and she and the other spy bosses are too \"passive,\" the president tweeted Wednesday morning. Haspel and the other heads of the spy services \"should go back to school!\" he wrote. The Intelligence people seem to be extremely passive and naive when it comes to the dangers of Iran. They are wrong! When I became President Iran was making trouble all over the Middle East, and beyond. Since ending the terrible Iran Nuclear Deal, they are MUCH different, but.... ....a source of potential danger and conflict. They are testing Rockets (last week) and more, and are coming very close to the edge. There economy is now crashing, which is the only thing holding them back. Be careful of Iran. Perhaps Intelligence should go back to school! Haspel also said Iran's leadership is assessing whether it should continue to abide by the nuclear agreement \u2014 \"we do see them debating among themselves as they've failed to realize the economic benefits they hoped for from the deal.\" She appeared with other top intelligence community leaders before the Senate intelligence committee on Tuesday. Trump's response on Wednesday followed a number of contradictions between the assessments of the national security establishment and the policies laid down by the White House. The White House and the intelligence community even differ over which top administration officials should get access to secret information. FBI authorities recommended against awarding security a clearance to Trump's son-in-law and adviser Jared Kushner, but the White House overruled them because that authority stems from the president. In responding to a question about the clearance, FBI Director Christopher Wray summed up the situation in which the national security establishment finds itself: All it can do is present what it learns to the president, he said. Trump retains the privilege, as president, to take whatever action he wants. \"We do not actually make recommendations one way or the other about the clearances,\" Wray said. \"The decision about what to do based on those facts is entrusted by long-standing process to the requesting entity. So we provide the information, but then they make the call.\" House oversight committee Chairman Elijah Cummings, D-Md., has vowed to investigate the White House's security clearances practices following news reports about how they work. Sometimes, the same page There are some areas of alignment. Trump has given many warnings about China, mostly about what he calls an unfair economic relationship with the United States, and the top intelligence chiefs echoed what they called that danger on Tuesday. China has robbed American companies of billions of dollars' worth of proprietary trade secrets, and Coats and his colleagues reaffirmed that Beijing's long-term goal is no less than supplanting the United States as the world's dominant power, however it can. \"China's actions reflect a long-term strategy to achieve global superiority,\" Coats said. \"Beijing's global ambition continues to restrict the personal freedoms of its citizens while strictly enforcing obedience to Chinese leadership with very few remaining checks on President Xi's [Jinping's] power.\" That's music to Trump's ears, politically, because it strengthens his case in dealing aggressively with Beijing on trade and other issues. And even on Iran, which Trump made the subject of his criticism on Wednesday, the heads of the intelligence agencies generally concur about the security threats it poses in the Middle East. Ballistic missiles, support for insurgent and terror groups, and other activities \"underscore our concerns for a long-term trajectory of Iranian influence in the region and the risk of conflict escalation,\" Coats said on Tuesday. Border breakdown But there was nothing like that kind of ammunition available to Trump this week on the president's biggest single priority: building a permanent barrier between the United States and Mexico. Trump calls the situation along the Southern border a crisis and is evaluating the idea of declaring a formal emergency there under law, which would permit him to move around money without the approval of Congress to begin construction. However, at a Senate hearing dedicated to the \"worldwide threats\" facing the United States, the word \"Mexico\" was spoken exactly once, according to a transcript. Coats and his compatriots discussed the problems of transnational crime and the flow of drugs into the United States, but they did not say that \u2014 as he has in the past \u2014 warning lights are blinking red. Dilemma for Republicans Many members of Congress, including Republicans aligned with Trump, have tried to keep closer to orthodoxy on the major security issues facing the United States while still remaining supportive of Trump himself. South Carolina Sen. Lindsey Graham both faulted the president for ordering a military withdrawal from Syria and supports Trump's prospective declaration of an emergency in order to increase construction of a border barrier. And Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., also stuck closely by Trump through the government shutdown this month over the border wall \u2014 albeit with something of a low profile \u2014 but at the same time made clear that he opposes removing American forces from Syria. Michael Morell, a former acting director of the CIA, said intelligence workers aren't playing a political game. The \u201cintelligence people\u201d are trained professionals who serve our nation with honor and dignity every day. They don\u2019t play politics with national security \u2014 ever.  They deserve a president\u2019s respect, not his/her public rebuke, which only serves to help our adversaries. https://t.co/oTenRFQAaj For Democrats, Trump's criticism of the intelligence community on Wednesday followed what they've called a worrying, years-long pattern of willingness to simply discard the advice of specialists. Moreover, the insights that Coats and his colleagues have gleaned around the world come at the cost of significant effort, Senate intelligence committee Vice Chairman Mark Warner, D-Va., said on Wednesday. The President has a dangerous habit of undermining the intelligence community to fit his alternate reality. People risk their lives for the intelligence he just tosses aside on Twitter. https://t.co/BfRlqcM6rd Coats acknowledged the heightened political environment during Tuesday's hearing and said he has tried to encourage intelligence professionals to focus on their work, not the criticism. \"I want our people to get up in the morning and come to work thinking that this is what our job is, despite the swirl of politics that swirls around, not only in the Capitol but the world,\" Coats said. \"Our mission is to keep our heads down. Our focus on the mission that we have to achieve in order to keep American people safe and our policymakers aware of what's happening.\"",

A half-dozen generals belonging largely to district commands and with direct control over thousands of troops joined Maduro in accusing the United States of meddling in Venezuela's affairs and said they would uphold the socialist leader's rule. In Venezuela's tense standoff in which two men are claiming to be the legitimate head of state, analysts say that Nicol\u00e1s Maduro, the nation's increasingly authoritarian president, holds the upper hand \u2014 at least for now \u2014 thanks to the support of the armed forces. On Thursday, Defense Minister Vladimir Padrino L\u00f3pez denounced opposition leader Juan Guaid\u00f3, who, the day before, had declared himself the country's president and was recognized by the U.S., the Organization of American States and most Latin American countries. Guaid\u00f3 says he wants to form a provisional government that would hold free elections and return Venezuela to democracy. But in a televised speech, Padrino called his oath-taking a \"disgraceful\" stunt and said Washington was using Guaid\u00f3 to foment a coup. And Padrino emphatically stated that the military continues to back Maduro as Venezuela's \"legitimate president\" and \"our commander in chief.\" Padrino's speech was a blow to the opposition, which is betting that Guaid\u00f3's dramatic swearing-in ceremony in front of a massive crowd in Caracas coupled with strong support from foreign governments will persuade Venezuelan military officers to break ranks with Maduro. Maduro is deeply unpopular after leading Venezuela into hyperinflation, food shortages, political repression and a refugee crisis. The current unrest was sparked by his insistence on starting another six-year term on Jan. 10, following a presidential election last year that was widely deemed fraudulent. Despite some recent defections and arrests in the country's security forces, analysts who track the Venezuelan military point to numerous factors that are keeping more officers from rebelling. For one thing, the top brass has been shielded from Venezuela's economic meltdown because these officers receive numerous perks and have been put in charge of lucrative government operations \u2014 everything from arms purchases and steel production to food distribution and the vital oil industry. Some senior officers have gotten rich off shady deals, including drug trafficking, illegal gold mining, currency scams and contraband smuggling, says R. Evan Ellis, a research professor at the U.S. Army War College who studies Latin American militaries. U.S. court indictments and targeted sanctions have named several Venezuelans who have served in the South American country's security forces. Ellis contends that the fear of arrest or extradition under a Guaid\u00f3-led government has persuaded many officers to throw in their lot with Maduro. What's more, Cuban agents work closely with top Venezuelan officials to snuff out coups before they can be launched. \"My sense is that everyone is paralyzed and thinking that it's safer to do nothing,\" Ellis tells NPR. \"Officers have been thoroughly compromised and, with the Cubans watching, there is not fertile soil for a coup to gain critical momentum.\" Bruce Bagley, a professor of international studies at the University of Miami, predicts that \"at least through 2019 we are going to see Maduro remain in power backed by the military, which is the crucial element here.\" The military has often served as Venezuela's ultimate power broker. In recent decades, it has been involved in coups that have both crushed and restored democratic rule. In fact, Guaid\u00f3's swearing-in ceremony took place Wednesday to mark the anniversary of a civic-military uprising in 1958 that deposed dictator Gen. Marcos P\u00e9rez Jim\u00e9nez. During the Cold War, the Venezuelan military was a strong U.S. ally and a major client for arms and aircraft, including F-16 fighter jets. But former President Hugo Ch\u00e1vez, a former army paratrooper who first came to prominence after leading a failed coup attempt, began revamping the armed forces after ushering in Venezuela's socialist revolution in 1999. Ch\u00e1vez broke with the Pentagon and brought in Cuban military advisers. He based promotions on loyalty to the revolution. And he gave vast new powers to his favorite officers, a trend that has accelerated under Maduro as he tries to keep the military on board amid the deepening crisis. Addressing troops and officers in a speech on Wednesday, Maduro called for \"maximum loyalty.\" Still, there are signs of growing discontent. Thousands of troops, who earn the equivalent of just a few dollars per month, have deserted, and scores of officers have been arrested on conspiracy charges. On Monday, about two dozen National Guard members raided an arms depot in Caracas and called for a popular uprising before they were arrested. \"Most of these plots have been small because they are easier to hide\" from counterintelligence agents, said Harold Trinkunas, a Venezuela expert at Stanford University. Rather than pushing for a traditional coup, he adds, the opposition is trying to convince officers they should simply keep their troops in the barracks and allow anti-government demonstrations to build until Maduro is forced out. To convince them, Guaid\u00f3 is promising to pardon officers who abandon Maduro and back the opposition. Ironically, Ellis says that amnesty could produce a scenario in which corrupt officers who switch sides and help ease out Maduro get to keep their stolen money while portraying themselves as democratic heroes. But thus far, there have been no reports of any takers. As the impasse drags on, some fear that Maduro could resort to the repressive tactics that he has successfully used before: a military crackdown on protesters and the arrest of opposition leaders. In an analysis published Thursday, the International Crisis Group warned: \"If Maduro retains the armed forces' support, he will almost certainly seek to stay in power and violently crush those who are challenging him.\"",

(Above) Thierry, age 9, was born without his left leg and received a prosthesis from the group, which is now pulling out of the country.\n                \n                    \n                    Evrard Niyomwungere/Humanity & Inclusion\n                    \n                \nhide caption The group Handicap International (now known as Humanity & Inclusion) has provided aid in Burundi for 26 years. (Above) Thierry, age 9, was born without his left leg and received a prosthesis from the group, which is now pulling out of the country. For 26 years, Handicap International has not only been providing crutches, prosthetics and wheelchairs to people with disabilities in Burundi, it has also been a leading advocate for people with disabilities in the country. Much of its work has focused on helping people get physical therapy, accessible housing and jobs. But all of that is over now. HI has been ordered by the government to stop its work in Burundi in a dispute over ethnic quotas. The government is requiring all foreign aid groups to commit to having 60 percent of their local employees be Hutus and 40 percent Tutsis \u2013 the quota for government agencies. The government is also demanding that foreign charities provide staff lists specifically identifying employees by their ethnicity. Rather than comply, Handicap International (which just recently changed its name to Humanity & Inclusion) is laying off all 105 of its local employees, shutting down its operations and pulling out of the central African nation. Two other organizations \u2014 human rights group Avocats Sans Fronti\u00e8res and a Belgian NGO called RCN Justice & D\u00e9mocratie \u2014 have announced that they're also departing over the new requirements. The operation of dozens of other international aid groups remains suspended in a country where three-quarters of the population lives in poverty. The government initiative began on Sept. 27, when the head of Burundi's National Security Council, Gen. Silas Ntigurirwa, went on national television and said that foreign aid agencies were operating illegally in Burundi. \"The National Security Council has decided to suspend all activities of these NGOs for a period of three months dating from October 1 to allow the institutions in charge of them to verify their compliance with the laws and rules in place,\" the general declared. Burundi is adjacent to Rwanda. Like its neighbor, it has a population that's predominantly Hutu with a smaller Tutsi minority. The country fought a violent civil war from 1993 to 2005 that was intertwined with the Rwandan genocide and had ethnic tensions at its roots. Last fall roughly 130 foreign aid groups were ordered to suspend their operations and reapply for permission to operate in the country.  According to the government,  84 agencies had done so as of Jan. 1. Other charities that refused to go along with the new rules regarding ethnic quotas were told they were not allowed to work in the country in any way. \"We were clearly told that if we do not share the ethnic origin of all our employees then we are not allowed to start again our operations,\" says Dominique Delvigne, who oversees HI's operations in Burundi as the group's geographic director for the African Great Lakes region. \"We've never asked the staff to share their ethnic origin and we do not want to do it in this current context,\" he says. Ethnicity is not something that's officially noted on identification cards in Burundi as it was in Rwanda before the 1994 genocide.  Opponents of the new rules say it's not the role or responsibility of foreign NGOs to collect this information. This clash between the government and foreign aid workers comes as tensions in the country have been escalating. Amnesty International says security forces routinely kill, abduct, torture and detain people. The economy is in a tailspin. Burundi posted negative economic growth for the last three years, according to the African Development Bank.  In 2015, President Pierre Nkurunziza defied term limits and won a controversial third term.  Last year, the Central African nation quit the International Criminal Court and ejected the BBC and VOA.  Hundreds of thousands of refugees have fled since Nkurunziza's latest re-election. \"It's very important to remember that the government in Burundi has been using ethnicity any time it's cornered,\" says a Burundian named Terry who now lives in the United States. He asked that his last name not be used because he still has family in Burundi and is concerned they could be harassed if he criticizes the government.  Terry says there's still a lot of ethnic tension in Burundi, and he worries how the information that NGOs are being asked to collect might eventually be used. \"It could be used to track people. It could be used to intimidate people,\" he says. \"Or it could be used to kill or to identify people to be killed who are considered opponents.\" The new rules also require foreign aid groups to deposit a certain percentage of their annual budget in Burundi's central bank \u2014 seen as a rather blatant attempt to give the government access to much-needed foreign currency. In announcing the ethnic quotas for NGO staff, government officials said they are attempting to make sure that aid groups hire more Hutus, who traditionally have been underrepresented in some sectors. At the time of the initial announcement of the new rules, a spokesman for the president also accused foreign NGOs of spreading homosexuality and attempting to destabilize Burundi.  Some of the NGOs do \"nothing,\" he said, accusing one unnamed group of passing out only three chickens over the course of three years. Dozens of aid groups are still in negotiations with the government about their operating status in Burundi. Dominique Delvigne of HI says the decree has had a huge impact not just on aid workers, but on the whole country. \"The effect of the suspension was immediate,\" he says. \"We were not allowed anymore to work. We couldn't even go and work with our support staff in our offices.  We really had to stop the activities.\" Agencies running hospitals and schools were allowed to continue, but all the other groups had to close their doors.  At least three aid workers who ignored the order were arrested. \"As you can understand it was a very hard decision to make,\" Delvigne says. But he says it was an important decision. The government's request for ethnic information on HI's employees was a \"red line\" he says they were not willing to cross.",

Sunday marks the second anniversary of President Trump's inauguration. At the midpoint of his four-year term, Trump has already delivered on some of his campaign promises, such as boosting funding for the military. Other pledges have been all but ignored, like his promise to lead a $1 trillion infrastructure push. With many of Trump's promises, however, the record is somewhere in between \u2014 not exactly \"mission accomplished,\" but not \"mission forgotten\" either. Loading... Don't see the graphic above? Click here. Here's a progress report on the president's first two years: Two years into his presidency, Trump has not built a wall along the Southern border. And Mexico certainly hasn't paid for it. But the president continues to lobby for a wall, even going so far as to shut down part of the government in an effort to win funding for a 234-mile stretch of border barrier. The president has also pursued other get-tough measures against both legal and illegal immigration. \"We've never had a president who has focused so much attention on immigration policy,\" said Andrew Selee, president of the Migration Policy Institute, \"and so uniformly in the direction of trying to reduce the number of people coming here and removing those who are here illegally.\" Trump has slashed the number of refugees entering the country, tried to end Obama-era protections for young immigrants living in the country illegally, and after a few rewrites, he ultimately won Supreme Court approval for his travel ban. Trump has delivered on his promises to renegotiate the North American Free Trade Agreement and to withdraw from the Trans-Pacific Partnership, a big Asian trade deal. The new NAFTA, which Trump calls the USMCA, still needs approval from Congress. And 11 other countries in the TPP are moving ahead with their own agreement, putting U.S. exporters at a competitive disadvantage. Trump stopped short of labeling China a \"currency manipulator\" as he promised. But he has imposed tariffs on $250 billion in Chinese exports. Trade talks with China are ongoing. The president has also imposed steep tariffs on steel and aluminum imports and threatened to impose tariffs on imported cars. \"These are all things that President Trump promised to do during the campaign \u2014 for better or for worse \u2014 and in my view he's very much followed through with a lot of them,\" said Chad Bown, a senior fellow at the pro-trade Peterson Institute for International Economics. Trading partners, including traditional allies, have retaliated with tariffs of their own on a variety of U.S. exports. The U.S. trade deficit, which Trump often complains about, has widened over the last two years. The GOP-controlled Congress passed a big tax cut just over a year ago, and that's contributed to a surge in economic growth. The White House argues that higher growth rates will continue for the next decade. But many other forecasters believe this is a short-term \"sugar high\" that will fade in the next year or two. There's no debate about the effect on federal revenues. The tax cut has reduced government revenues and contributed to a ballooning federal deficit, expected to reach $1 trillion this year. \"We heard some people claim these tax cuts are going to pay for themselves,\" said Marc Goldwein, senior vice president of the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget. \"Certainly, they haven't to date, and there's no evidence they will in the future.\" Trump promised to promote fossil fuels, and last year the U.S. became the world's largest oil producer. Natural gas production is also booming, thanks to the same \"fracking\" revolution. While these trends began during the Obama administration, Trump has definitely encouraged them, said Daniel Yergin, energy historian and vice chairman of IHS Markit. \"Sometimes it seems that the world's No. 1 natural gas/[liquefied natural gas] salesman is Donald Trump,\" Yergin said. Trump has championed oil and gas drilling both offshore and on public lands. His support has not sparked a similar boom in the coal fields, however. Coal continues to lose market share for electricity generation in the U.S., partly because of competition from cheap natural gas and increasingly affordable wind  and solar power.

And politically the law is more popular than it has been.\" Obamacare's Medicaid expansion has now been extended to 37 states, including several additional red states where voters opted into the program last year. Enrollment in the federally run insurance marketplaces dipped less than 5 percent this year, even though there's no longer a tax penalty for people who go without insurance, and the administration has fostered a variety of skimpy coverage alternatives. Democrats made preservation of Obamacare's protection for people with pre-existing medical conditions a centerpiece of their midterm campaign. \"As a result of the repeal and replace effort, Democrats are on offense now on health care and Republicans are on defense,\" Altman said. Trump boasted about his efforts to cut red tape this month in a speech to the American Farm Bureau Federation, telling farmers he'd delivered \"the biggest cuts in regulations in the history of our country, and we're going further.\" The president, along with a GOP Congress, has moved aggressively to unwind regulations, including rules governing carbon emissions, fuel economy, water pollution and payday lending. (Two big Obama-era rules \u2014 on overtime and investment advice \u2014 were also blocked by the courts.) \"He certainly has tried to do what he said he was going to do,\" said Peter Van Doren, senior fellow at the libertarian Cato Institute. Van Doren cautioned, however, that much of Trump's push for deregulation could be stymied in court, unless the administration can establish a factual rationale for the proposed changes. \"You can't just say you want to change this rule because we won the election,\" Van Doren said. \"The law doesn't allow that.\" President Trump applauds as Supreme Court Associate Justice Neil Gorsuch delivers remarks after taking the judicial oath in a ceremony at the White House Rose Garden in April 2017. Getting a justice appointed to the court was a key campaign promise for Trump.\n                \n                    \n                    Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption With the help of a GOP-controlled Senate, Trump continues to put his stamp on the federal bench, seating a second Supreme Court justice in 2018, and bringing his total of confirmed appellate court judges to 30 \u2014 more than any other president at this point in his term. (By contrast, Trump lags former Presidents Bill Clinton and George W. Bush in his pace of seating district court judges.) As with the Supreme Court, most of Trump's appellate court picks have replaced judges who were also nominated by Republicans. So Trump's accomplishment is not so much creating a conservative court as locking one in that was already there. \"Now, obviously if you replace a 70-year-old, slightly to the right appellate judge with a 45-year-old, fire-brand conservative, you're not trading apples for apples,\" said Russell Wheeler, who tracks judicial nominees at the Brookings Institution. Wheeler suspects Trump will not have as many appeals court vacancies to fill in the second half of his term. But the judicial appointments he's already made will be delivering on the president's promises, long after Trump leaves office. Trump promised to weed out corruption in Washington by establishing new limits on lobbying by former administration officials. But watchdogs say in some cases, the new limits are less restrictive than ones already in place. \"I think the revolving door is operating much as it always has and maybe a little faster and more vigorously than it did prior to President Trump coming in,\" said Walter Shaub, former director of the Office of Government Ethics. Conflicts abound within the administration, including many officials who now regulate the industries they used to work in. What's more, three of Trump's Cabinet officials resigned in 2018 under ethical clouds. \"I think he's been filling the swamp with more alligators, rather than draining it,\" said Shaub, who's now a senior adviser for the watchdog group Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington.",

Maduro starts his second term amid international denunciation of his victory and a devastating economic crisis. Nicolas Maduro has been sworn in as president of Venezuela, taking power for six more years amid an economic crisis that has caused an outpouring of migrants from the country. The socialist successor to Hugo Chavez won re-election to a second term last May, in a contest that was denounced as a sham by the United States, Canada and a dozen Latin American nations. Maduro was sworn in by the nation's supreme court, The Associated Press reports, cheered on by officials and flag-waving children. Outside the court's chambers, a noticeable increase in security presence marked the quiet streets of Caracas early on morning of the inauguration. By mid-morning, a crowd of supporters lined the street leading up to the site of the inauguration, according to freelance journalist Mariana Zuniga. \"Some of [the supporters] were there because they truly supported President Maduro,\" Zuniga tells NPR's Audie Cornish. But she says others were obliged to attend because they were government employees. \"In Venezuela it's not uncommon that state workers are obliged to go to these rallies or vote in elections,\" she says. In his speech, Maduro emphasized the legitimacy of his government and urged other Latin American countries to acknowledge his second term. Freelance journalist Stefano Pozzebon wrote on Twitter that \"massive security measures\" had been put in place for the ceremony, following an apparent attempted assassination of Maduro by drones packed with explosives last summer. this is the view inside the #SupremeCourt in #Caracas where @NicolasMaduro is set to proceed with his swear-in ceremony in about 30', by my colleague @perezvalery Massive security measures in place after that drone thing in August #ThisIsVzla pic.twitter.com/zlCDUnay2t National Security Adviser John Bolton said on Thursday the United States will not recognize the \"illegitimate\" inauguration. \"We will continue to increase pressure on the corrupt regime, support the democratic National Assembly, and call for democracy and freedom in Venezuela,\" Bolton tweeted. The Trump administration imposed sanctions on former Venezuelan government officials earlier in the week, citing corruption in Maduro's administration. Last year the U.S. sanctioned Venezuela's gold sector, which Maduro has turned to for revenue as oil production has fallen. Shortly after Maduro took his oath of office, Paraguay's president said the country was breaking off diplomatic relations with Venezuela and refusing to recognize Maduro's re-election. Five Latin American countries and Canada have asked the International Criminal Court to investigate Venezuela for crimes against humanities, including torture and the arbitrary detention of anti-government protesters. Maduro has managed to retain allies in Latin America, despite international outcry. Attendees of the ceremony included two longtime backers of the current Venezuelan administration, Cuban President Miguel Diaz-Canel and Bolivian President Evo Morales. Several Caribbean nations that receive subsidized oil from Venezuela have also continued to support the government, reports NPR's John Otis. Hyperinflation, widespread hunger and deaths from preventable diseases in formerly oil-rich Venezuela have sparked an exodus of more than 3 million people, from a nation with a population of just over 30 million, Otis reports. Most head to Colombia, Ecuador, Peru and Brazil. The tiny twin-island Caribbean nation of Trinidad and Tobago has received 60,000 Venezuelans since the crisis began. But Rodney Charles, a lawmaker in the country, says Trinidad refuses to label them \"refugees,\" in order to toe the line with Maduro's government. \"It does not make sense,\" he told NPR last month. \"We hear the news. We hear the reports - the starvation in Venezuela, the incarceration of political opponents.\" Last year's election drew widespread accusations of fraud. Maduro's government controls most of the country's media and electoral authorities, NPR's Philip Reeves reported. The administration also provided more food handouts in the run-up to the election, leading to a drop in prices, which had swelled due to inflation. A wave of protests driven by the opposition swept the country in 2017, Zuniga says. But after a government crackdown, fewer people have taken to the streets. \"Now you can see some kind of protests,\" she says. \"But they are not political or against the government, they are more people complaining about the quality of life, about the scarcity of food, the lack of electricity or water.\"",

            "article_content": "Relatives of Aisha Rabi, 48, mourn at the family home during her funeral in the West Bank village of Bidya in October 2018.\n                \n                    \n                    Majdi Mohammed/AP\n                    \n                \nhide caption Relatives of Aisha Rabi, 48, mourn at the family home during her funeral in the West Bank village of Bidya in October 2018. Israel's security service says it has arrested five Israeli yeshiva students allegedly involved in last year's fatal stoning of a Palestinian woman in the West Bank. The arrests in late December have heightened tensions between the state and radical Israeli settlers and their supporters ahead of national elections in April. Aisha Rabi, 48, was on her way home to Bidya in the northern West Bank on a Friday night in October 2018 when her family's car came under a hail of stones. She was struck in the head and died. Thousands of people attended the funeral of the woman survived by a husband and eight children, The Associated Press reports. Rabi's widower, Yacoub, tells the Israeli daily Haaretz that he was driving the car and saw a group of young men standing nearby. He says he was certain no Palestinians would be out that late in that area, which is close to several ultranationalist Israeli communities. \"I don't have any doubt it was the settlers,\" he says. Israel's Shin Bet security service says the teenage suspects were arrested on grave terrorism and murder charges. Families of the suspects have cited unfair treatment at the hands of the state and have received sympathy at high levels of office. This has prompted accusations that Israeli authorities will ease potential punishment of suspects in a murder case. Israeli media broadcast a recording Thursday of a phone call between Justice Minister Ayelet Shaked and the mother of one of the suspects. The mother says her son has not yet seen a lawyer. Shaked answers that while she can't intervene in the investigation, she will speak to the state prosecutor. \"Be strong, and you know, it will end in the coming days, I estimate,\" Shaked says. Israeli authorities partially lifted a gag order on the case Sunday as they released information about the arrests. The Shin Bet says the suspects are students at the Pri Haaretz yeshiva in the Rehelim settlement in the northern West Bank. On the Saturday morning after the attack, the agency says, the teens traveled to Rehelim from the nearby settlement of Yitzhar for \"a briefing for youths studying at the yeshiva on how to prepare and cope with Shin Bet investigations.\" This would be unusual, because most yeshiva students would observe the religious injunction not to drive on the Sabbath. Sympathetic rabbis reportedly ruled that the settler activists could violate the Sabbath because the Shin Bet investigation could pose a danger to their lives. Since Shaked's call, some suspects have reportedly met with attorneys. The lawyers say their clients have been shackled to chairs, shouted at, cursed and denied their civil rights \u2014 and that two of the youths have still not been allowed to meet with legal counsel. Attorney Itamar Ben-Gvir has called on Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to stop the Shin Bet and demand the release of the suspects. \"Mister prime minister, we shout out and cry to you, they are impinging on the rights of children. Stop this behavior,\" Ben-Gvir said during a news conference. The Shin Bet notes that \"from the beginning of the arrests\" there has been a \"coordinated and ongoing effort from sources with an interest in slandering the organization and its workers and delegitimize its activities.\" The Shin Bet adds that in the past year it has thwarted \"hundreds of terrorist activities\" in the West Bank \"among them \u2014 also Jewish terrorist attacks.\" The suspects in Rabi's death are anti-Zionists, the Shin Bet notes. The security services said one of the suspects had in his room an Israeli flag with a swastika drawn on it. Rabi died during an uptick of violence in the West Bank. Days before her death, a Palestinian gunman killed two Israelis at a factory near the settlement of Ariel, the BBC reports. Ariel is also in the northern West Bank, not far from where Rabi was attacked. It is unclear whether the two incidents were related. In 2018, Haaretz reports, Jewish perpetrators committed 482 acts of violence and property damage against Palestinians, an increase of more than threefold from the previous year. The arrests come after Prime Minister Netanyahu called for early elections in April. Among his critics are Shaked and Naftali Bennett, hardliners who have formed a new political party and accuse Netanyahu of being too harsh on settlers. Rabi's death triggered a note of sympathy for Palestinians from a U.S. administration that has taken several high-profile steps in favor of Israel, including moving the U.S. Embassy to Jerusalem and cutting off support to the United Nations agency that aids Palestinian refugees. After the attack that killed Rabi, U.S. special envoy Jason Greenblatt issued a tweet, saying his thoughts and prayers were with Rabi's family. \"An investigation into this reprehensible act is ongoing,\" he added.

            "article_content": "Demonstrators ransacked this Ebola transit center in Beni in the Democratic Republic of Congo, where the struggle to control the disease \u2014 and the protests it has sparked \u2014 will be part of the global health landscape in 2019.\n                \n                    \n                    Alexis Huguet /AFP/Getty Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption Demonstrators ransacked this Ebola transit center in Beni in the Democratic Republic of Congo, where the struggle to control the disease \u2014 and the protests it has sparked \u2014 will be part of the global health landscape in 2019. At the beginning of 2018, we made predictions about what the year in global health and development might look like in the countries we cover. The pundits we interviewed forecast that 2018 would bring a decline in the number of health workers around the world, inspire more humanitarians to share their #MeToo stories and see more conflict that would drive the world's humanitarian crises. Our predictors didn't do too badly. The Lancet's latest Global Burden of Disease study noted: \"The global shortage and unequal distribution of health workers requires urgent attention.\" In October, international charities gathered in London to try to tackle sexual harassment in the aid sector. And a 2018 report from UNOCHA found that \"conflict remains the main driver of humanitarian needs.\" So what should we expect in 2019? We reached out to pundits in global health and development and they came up with nine bold predictions. 1. Positive social change will be contagious in Africa. Over the past year, Ethiopia has gone through a historic transformation at breakneck speed, reports NPR correspondent Eyder Peralta. The country welcomed a new reformist prime minister, who forged peace with former enemy Eritrea and freed thousands of political prisoners. Tobias Denskus, a professor of international development communications at Malmo University and the founder of Aidnography, a global health and development blog, thinks that could inspire other African countries. \"Eritrea is one of the most isolated, autocratic and dictatorial nations,\" he says. \"I'm hoping that positive social change in neighboring countries like Ethiopia will lead Eritrea to do the same.\" - Malaka Gharib 2. Urban slums will grow. The majority of Africa's population is young \u2014 and that so-called youth bulge will mean \"more and more people will make the shift from rural to urban centers in search of jobs and opportunity and driven by changing climate,\" says Kennedy Odede, co-founder and CEO of the nonprofit SHOFCO, which provides education, grassroots organizing and services like health care and water in the slums of Kenya. The changing urban landscape will be a challenge for governments. They \"will have to be responsive to rapid change or risk humanitarian crises and destabilization,\" Odede says. If governments do not provide better services for this new urban population, Odede says there could be an \"urban spring\" \u2014 protests and chaos from angry, uneducated, marginalized youth. But he is an optimist: \"There is opportunity in this to harness the energy and intellect of young people.\" - Marc Silver 3. More countries will follow the U.S. example of pulling out of U.N. funding. On January 1, the U.S. formally left UNESCO, the United Nations Education, Science and Cultural Organization. At the end of World War II, the United States helped found UNESCO to preserve the world's heritage sites and promote the flow of ideas to prevent future conflicts. But then, UNESCO granted full membership to the Palestinians, and the U.S. stopped funding it, NPR reported. This is not the first time that the U.S. has left the U.N. heritage agency. It  withdrew once before, in 1984, citing corruption and an ideological tilt toward the Soviet Union against the West, according to Foreign Policy. Tobias Denskus of Malmo University predicts that the U.S. will make further cuts: \"I'm worried that as we move closer to U.S. elections, U.N. funding will suffer even more and ultimately weaken [the U.N.].\" And he worries the U.S. precedent will cause other countries to reduce their contributions based on their political agenda.  - Malaka Gharib 4. There will be more significant infectious disease outbreaks \u2014 maybe even a pandemic ... \"We're seeing a global increase in the spread of infectious diseases,\" says Jennifer Nuzzo, a senior scholar at the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security who leads the Outbreak Observatory, a group that collects information about outbreaks. And she doesn't expect a change in that pattern. \"In fact,\" she says, \"there are worrying signs that the conditions favoring the emergence of a pandemic \u2014 and the impact it would have \u2014 are ever more present and possibly getting worse.\" These conditions include increased migration that's exposing people to diseases they've never encountered before, densely populated megacities and resettlement camps, vaccine refusals, compromised infrastructures as a result of humanitarian crises like conflict, natural disasters and instability as well as climate change that's exacerbating disasters and pushing disease-bearing wildlife into new habitats. - Joanne Lu 5. ... but the odds are good we can beat back a bad outbreak. The ability to respond quickly to pandemics is also increasing, says Nuzzo. For example, the DRC was able to control the first phase of its Ebola outbreak in a couple of months, and there's now an Ebola vaccine that didn't exist four years ago when the virus swept West Africa. Still, the second phase of the outbreak \u2013 which is now the second largest and second deadliest in history \u2013 shows that political instability can stand in the way of such advances. \"The case for optimism is that the emergence and spread of diseases may be inevitable, but the impacts that they have on society aren't,\" she says. \"We should count on there being very significant outbreaks. Whether they become pandemics is up to us.\" - Joanne Lu 6. People who need mental health help will find it on their phone. The fields of mental health and substance abuse treatments are about to take a great leap forward into the digital world, predicts psychiatrist Vikram Patel, professor of global health and social medicine at Harvard University. The solution to fighting stigma and the lack of trained counselors could be right in your pocket \u2013 a smartphone or even a plain old flip phone. Counselors with a web connection could learn about effective diagnosis and treatment online. They could ping their patients with online tips. People with depression or schizophrenia or substance abuse in rich and poor countries could use their phones to check in with a counselor, receive guidance or touch base with others facing the same issues. Researchers around the world are also testing a variety of apps. The University of Washington is working on a variety of cellphone-based training and treatment programs in Ghana, where cellphones are common and there's a broad 3G network. The FDA is working on ways to approve digital programs for cognitive behavioral therapy. And the National Institute of Mental Health in the U.S., which is also predicting greater use of digital technology in the future, already provides a guide for finding effective mental health apps. - Joanne Silberner 7. Nonprofit leadership will become more diverse. Bullying, sexual harassment and sex scandals in the humanitarian industry made headlines in 2018, from big aid agencies like UNAIDS to small nonprofits like More Than Me. One solution to this, critics have said, is to hire more diverse and qualified candidates. \"Many organizations are realizing that they should diversify to represent views that have been traditionally sidelined,\" says Tobias Denskus of Malmo University. \"The pressure is increasing to hire more female leaders and hire capable managers from the global south, from the LGBT community who haven't been included before.\" \"More qualified, diverse candidates from Africa and beyond are knocking at the door,\" adds Denskus \u2014 now it's up to the aid organizations to let them in. - Malaka Gharib 8. There will be fewer food crises. Dry season has begun in sub-Saharan Africa \u2014 the period from roughly November through April or May when the rains stop. As climate change has affected weather patterns, droughts have become increasingly severe. By February, \"you see the faces of hungry people from Ethiopia to Kenya to South Sudan,\" says Esther Ngumbi, a researcher at the University of Illinois and an Aspen Institute New Voices food security fellow. But in 2019, she is hopeful that the impact of the dry season will not be as dramatic. The reason, she says, is that countries are doing a better job equipping their farmers with water storage systems and encouraging them to plant drought-resistant crops like millet and sorghum, both highly nutritional grains, and cowpeas (aka black-eyed peas), whose seeds are high in protein. Famine and food insecurity will still be part of the 2019 landscape, especially in conflict-torn areas. But Ngumbi is predicts fewer hunger emergencies: \"It's already January, and we haven't seen new calls for emergency relief.\" - Marc Silver 9. Wealthy countries will turn away more people seeking asylum. Paul Spiegel, director of the Center for Humanitarian Health at Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, worries that there will be \"an increase in denial for people seeking asylum in high-income countries.\" As a result of increasing anti-immigration and anti-refugee sentiment, some countries in Europe have begun to \"pay off\" lower-income countries to shoulder the burden of taking in refugees, he says. In 2016, for example, Germany struck a deal with Turkey to quell the flow of refugees from Syria. In exchange for $6.8 billion, Turkey created facilities to detain refugees in camps while their asylum claims in Germany were being processed. In 2017, Italy followed suit, establishing a similar deal with Libya. Spiegel worries that programs like these will ramp up in 2019 in the U.S. and beyond. \"In the U.S., we're already having trouble with the Mexican border. What's going to happen when Venezuelans start making their way over here?\" he says. For U.S. government officials to stay in power, he predicts they too will take a tougher stance on immigration policy \u2014 adopting the idea that the U.S. must \"be strong at the borders.\" - Malaka Gharib Got a big, bold prediction for global health and development in 2019?

            "article_content": "France vows to rebuild the fire-ravaged cathedral. The Trump administration again moves to discourage migrants from seeking asylum in the U.S. Indonesians vote to elect a new president.  STEVE INSKEEP, HOST: How exactly was it that a French cathedral caught fire? DAVID GREENE, HOST: Much of the world has a real interest in that question. To be short, no one was killed as the Notre Dame Cathedral burned. The building itself was damaged but not destroyed. So it's not really the cost but rather the emotional significance of the church beside the Seine that leads to the pressure for some answers. INSKEEP: NPR's Ofeibea Quist-Arcton is in Paris and has been listening to investigators. Ofeibea, hi there. OFEIBEA QUIST-ARCTON, BYLINE: Greetings. INSKEEP: How did this fire unfold in the way that it did? QUIST-ARCTON: Steve, there's a question mark about why. But the how is that these 800-year-old timbers - trees that no longer grow in France that were a lattice work that made up the roof - just burned. And that's why, when you see those dramatic images looking up to the skies through Notre Dame Cathedral, you see no roof. That came down. And that's when we saw those flames shooting into the sky and the black plumes of smoke that made people so desperate that they were going to lose Notre Dame. INSKEEP: There was a fear that they would lose the entire church. It looked - from the outside, at one point - as if the whole thing, other than the stone walls, might burn. But that's not actually what happened in the end. QUIST-ARCTON: Indeed, especially when the spire came crashing down, caving in, and everybody held their collective breath. But France's deputy interior minister Laurent Nunez, he, yesterday, was speaking to journalists. And he laid out what the challenges are - were facing the firefighters, who, he said, were so brave and had battled the blaze. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) LAURENT NUNEZ: (Through interpreter) A handful of firefighters risked their lives to go up the towers and attack the fire from the inside, and this helped save the edifice. We only realized this morning that we came within about half an hour - or even 15 minutes - of losing it all. INSKEEP: Wow - within half an hour of losing it all, meaning - what does he mean by that? QUIST-ARCTON: That if these firefighters had not decided to go into the bell towers, those would not have been saved. And then, perhaps, the whole of Notre Dame would have come down. But it didn't happen. You know, with the roof punctured, the walls charred, the floors, you know, covered in this sea of ash, we're seeing what could have happened. But the belfries were saved. And you can still see a facade that Notre Dame is still there. INSKEEP: Yeah. And it's remarkable to think of people risking their lives not for other lives but for a building that is of such significance to so many - so how to repair what is left of Notre Dame. QUIST-ARCTON: And how long it'll take - and that's what's facing not only the French authorities but, I guess, experts all over - and how they're going to do it because, of course, we're talking about a medieval cathedral here, Steve. You know, 800-plus years - although, the spire was built in the 19th century. How are they going to get this extraordinary, symbolic place of worship back to its former glory? Everybody is now focusing on that. INSKEEP: And you have a tape here, I think, from an architect, who has worked on restorations of old buildings before. QUIST-ARCTON: That's right. Francis Maude - he worked on the restoration of Windsor Castle - Queen of England's - Queen of Britain's castle - following a fire that broke out in the chapel there back in '92. Have a listen. FRANCIS MAUDE: Having stabilized it, you can then move in and do - from a safe vantage point - a thorough investigation of the debris, which has fallen from the roof and from elsewhere. And within that, you may well find there are quite large chunks of material, which can be reincorporated into the rebuilt cathedral. QUIST-ARCTON: Steve, an emotional roller coaster, though, here. French people, Parisians, tourists - everybody absolutely aghast. And lots of money coming in - almost half a billion dollars so far. Everybody wants to see Notre Dame restored. INSKEEP: And Emmanuel Macron, the president, is saying he wants to do it in five years. NPR's Ofeibea Quist-Arcton, thanks so much. QUIST-ARCTON: Always a pleasure - thank you. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) INSKEEP: President Trump's administration is working again to make sure that people who seek shelter in the United States will feel pain. GREENE: Let's remember. In 2018, the administration separated parents and children at the southern border. Officials openly described that move as a deterrent to stop people from coming. The administration abandoned that policy under pressure. Well, now Attorney General William Barr has made another move. It's aimed at people who come to the U.S. seeking legal asylum. Barr's order says they should be held indefinitely without bail as they await a hearing on their asylum claims. President Trump has complained about what he refers to as catch and release policies, allowing people to go free as they await a hearing. INSKEEP: NPR's Joel Rose covers immigration. He's on the line. Joel, good morning. JOEL ROSE, BYLINE: Hi, Steve. INSKEEP: How significant a change is this? ROSE: Well, until now, migrants who've crossed the border illegally can ask for asylum. If they pass the first hurdle by showing what's called a credible fear of persecution or torture back home, then they can ask an immigration judge to release them on bond. And if the judge decides that there's no reason to hold them, the migrants can be released until their full hearing in immigration court. That's been the process in place for more than a decade. But Barr's decision overturns that precedent. INSKEEP: I'm a little confused here because, as I understand it, William Barr is telling immigration judges how to decide a request for bond. Why - normally, the attorney general would be separate from a judge. Why is that Barr's decision to make? ROSE: Right. Immigration courts are not like criminal courts. They're part of the Department of Justice. So, yes, the attorney general can set the precedent, and an immigration judge has to follow it. And yet, this decision by Barr is certain to be challenged in court. Michael Tan is with the ACLU Immigrants' Rights Project. MICHAEL TAN: You can't lock people up without giving them the basic hearing before a judge, where that judge can look at the person and determine if they need to be locked up in the first place. ROSE: So the ACLU and other immigrants' rights groups say they will challenge this decision in federal court. They're already fighting the administration in another case about bond hearings for asylum-seekers in Washington state. So that is where their challenge is likely to play out. INSKEEP: How does this decision fit into the administration's broader effort to stop people from coming? ROSE: It seems like William Barr is following the path laid out by his predecessor, Attorney General Jeff Sessions, who tried to limit access to asylum for victims of domestic violence and gangs. The immigration system is straining because thousands of Central American migrants are showing up at the border every day. Many of them are claiming asylum. And the Trump administration argues that a lot of those claims are fake. And it wants to deter these people from coming to the U.S. and asking for asylum. INSKEEP: Any early indications as to whether people will be deterred? ROSE: Well, the administration's critics say no. They say bona fide asylum seekers will be kept in detention needlessly and that people will keep coming anyway because the situations they face in Central America are just so desperate. INSKEEP: Joel, thanks for your work. ROSE: Hey. You're welcome. INSKEEP: That's NPR's Joel Rose. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) INSKEEP: A giant democracy - the biggest Muslim-majority nation voted today. GREENE: Yeah. Tens of millions of people in Indonesia cast their ballots. Exit polls are projecting that President Joko Widodo has won another five-year term. The polls suggest he defeated his challenger easily. This race pitted Widodo against a former general. It was a rematch of an election in 2014. And another part of the dynamic here - the race revealed the growing influence of radical Islam. INSKEEP: Let's talk about that part of the story with NPR's Julie McCarthy, who's in the Indonesian capital, Jakarta. Hi, Julie. JULIE MCCARTHY, BYLINE: Hi there. INSKEEP: Indonesia has been seen as a place where moderate Islam flourished. What's changing? MCCARTHY: Well, yeah, that's right. Five thousand miles away from the Middle East and the birthplace of Islam, you had Indonesia that had been seen as proof that Islam and democracy could live side-by-side. But there were signs in this campaign that suggested Indonesia is becoming more religiously conservative. Take the president himself, President Widodo - now, this is a small example. But it's telling. Here's a guy who loves heavy metal music. And there he was at his finale rock concert rally, taking pains to thank the country's clerics... INSKEEP: (Laughter). MCCARTHY: ...For their support (laughter). INSKEEP: OK. So going for the heavy metal - got to like that - but also picking a cleric with hard-line views for his running mate, right? MCCARTHY: That's right. And that's a move that really jolted some of his supporters. Widodo moved to the right in a bid to neutralize the allegation that came up against him that he's not Islamic enough. And the analysts agree this was a politically expedient move. And it alienated some supporters, but others looked past it. And what's that tell us, Steve? We're in a country that operates in a world of gray. It's not black and white. But there are also some troubling signs that a climate of intolerance is growing. People are falling afoul of the blasphemy law. There's really no move to repeal it. The governor of Jakarta - a Christian - was charged with blasphemy, voted out of office. He was jailed. Now, Andreas Harsono with Human Rights Watch is the author of a new book titled \"Race, Islam And Power.\" And he says faith politics is growing at a fast clip here. And he says Indonesia is becoming dangerous. Here he is. ANDREAS HARSONO: The idea to change Indonesia into an Islamic state has been rising. And this is going to be a danger not only for the Strait of Malacca or for Southeast Asia, but it will bring a problem for the whole world. MCCARTHY: Now, I would hasten to add, Steve, here, that there are plenty of others who believe that Indonesia has been a moderate state, will remain one. And the re-election of Widodo goes a long way in demonstrating that. The turnout was around 80 percent. That's quite high even by Indonesian standards. INSKEEP: Although, I have to note, Julie McCarthy, we've seen this in the United States. Politicians make promises in campaigns that are seen as cynical pandering. But then they get elected, and people expect them to keep those promises. MCCARTHY: Well, that's right. And so his big balance will be, how is he going to deal with this growing Islamisation while he seeks a - pretty much of a secular agenda, which is to, you know, focus on human rights and more on - focus less on human rights and more on human resources, like the developing of the human capital of this country. It's a very young place - 42 percent are under 25. INSKEEP: NPR's Julie McCarthy is in Indonesia. Thanks so much. MCCARTHY: Thank you. Copyright \u00a9 2019 NPR.  All rights reserved.

Updated at 3:30 p.m. ET Austria's youngest-ever chancellor, 33-year-old Sebastian Kurz, is poised to reclaim his job after his party received its biggest victory in years, according to partial results of parliamentary elections. His conservative Austrian People's Party received more than 37% of the vote, 5 percentage points higher than its showing in 2017, when it teamed up with the far-right Freedom Party to form a government. \"It's been a difficult four months but today the people have chosen us again,\" Kurz told a crowd of cheering supporters. \"I'm rarely at a loss for words, but I'm practically speechless. We didn't expect such a result.\" Kurz's first government came crashing down in May after his coalition partner, the Freedom Party, became embroiled in a cash-for-contracts scandal. The conservatives do not have enough seats to govern alone so they will need a coalition partner. Kurz could team up with the Green Party, which won 14% of the vote, a significant improvement from 2017, when it failed to get enough votes to enter parliament. He could also team up again with the Freedom Party, which saw its support drop t0 16% \u2014 10% lower than 2017. Kurz might consider reuniting with the far-right party because it's \"very good at being in opposition, which creates headaches for Mr. Kurz,\" says Reinhard Heinisch, a professor of comparative politics at the University of Salzburg. \"But the Freedom Party is also very problematic.\" Kurz invited the Freedom Party into his government in 2017 with the intention of taming its worst tendencies. The party is known in Austria for populist rhetoric that vilifies migrants and Muslims. It has ties to radical right extremist groups like Generation Identity, which has links with the Christchurch terrorist who murdered 51 people at two mosques in New Zealand in March. Instead, the partnership was an 18-month roller-coaster of disturbing headlines about the far-right party's links to the Kremlin, a deeply anti-Semitic songbook and a poem likening migrants to rats. The final straw for Kurz came in May. His vice chancellor, Heinz-Christian Strache, then Freedom Party leader, was forced to resign after the German magazine Der Spiegel obtained and published a video from 2017, which was filmed secretly as part of a sting, showing him spending a boozy evening on the Spanish island of Ibiza with a woman posing as the niece of a rich Russian close to the Kremlin. In the video, Strache offers the woman government contracts if she supports the Freedom Party. \"Enough is enough,\" Kurz said then. Strache resigned, the Freedom Party left the government, and Kurz lost a no-confidence vote in parliament. A caretaker government led by former supreme court judge Brigitte Bierlein, the first female chancellor in history, has run the country all summer with a quiet competence that's won her admiration. \"People like having a government that's not always in the media,\" Heinisch says. Scrutiny of an \"unabashedly nationalist party\" The Freedom Party has made headlines for years. Most recently, partly because of the Ibiza video, its ties to Russia have come under scrutiny. While Austria has warm ties with Russia, the Freedom Party openly admires the Kremlin, raising eyebrows in the NATO-supporting West. \"It's in our interests to have a balanced worldwide network of allies and not to be a U.S. colony,\" says Johannes Huebner, a longtime Freedom Party member, during an interview in June. \"The thing is, in Europe, there is overwhelming U.S. influence through NATO through the control of the financial system, through the media, through the entertainment industry.\" Like other radical right parties, they also oppose immigration and are unabashedly nationalist \u2014 which means something in Austria, the birthplace of Adolf Hitler. Many in the Freedom Party see the defeat of Nazi Germany \"not as a victory for democracy but as a defeat for their cause,\" Heinisch says. Hitler annexed the country in 1938 but Austria did not go through the same process of post-war re-education as Germany. \"There was an anti-Nazi political consensus in the years after 1945 but there was never a consensus that you cannot cooperate politically with the far right,\" says Bernhard Weidinger at the Documentation Center for the Austrian Resistance in Vienna. \"So the two big parties\" \u2014 the center-right People's Party and the Social Democrats \u2014 \"they've always been flirting with the far right. And that of course, contributed massively to normalize policies of this party.\" Co-opting an anti-migrant message Sunday's election results show that the Ibiza scandal hurt the party more than expected. Public opinion polls had showed about one in five Austrians supporting the party. One is retired IT administrator Kurt Blind, who runs a monthly meeting of party faithful at a beer-and-schnitzel restaurant in Vienna. \"We may not have as many members as the other parties yet,\" he said in an interview in June. \"But each month we grow.\" The party had won support with its anti-migrant rhetoric, polished in 2015, when a million asylum-seekers and migrants arrived in Europe. Kurz rose to prominence in Austrian politics by trying co-opt that hard-line rhetoric and serve it up through \"his clean-cut, millennial blandness\" as a way to make it more palatable, says Nina Horaczek, an investigative reporter at the Austrian weekly Falter, who co-wrote a biography of Kurz. \"He did not understand that repeating hard-line anti-immigrant rhetoric in a nicer tone does not defeat far-right populists,\" she says. \"It makes them stronger.\" The Freedom Party's influence was most obvious in migration policy. The government cut benefits for migrant families, banned headscarves in elementary schools and threatened to force new asylum-seekers to work for less than $2 an hour. Dormitories housing asylum-seekers were renamed \"departure centers.\" In the town of Traiskirchen, just outside Vienna, Afghan asylum-seeker Daoud Saidi got the message. \"I'm not wanted here,\" he says. \"I told the Austrian authorities that the Taliban took over my village and that it's not safe. They told me I had to leave Austria.\" Can the Freedom Party reconcile with Kurz? The caretaker government axed the departure center signs and cancelled plans to pay new asylum-seekers sweatshop wages. Migration is not the top issue in this election. Austrians are nowadays more interested in issues such as climate change. But the Freedom Party still brings it up. \"On the issue of immigration, the Freedom Party has posters saying Mr. Kurz is learning from us,\" says Heinisch, the politics professor in Salzburg. As media have speculated that Kurz might team up with the Greens, which is pro-migration, in a new coalition government, the Freedom Party has told voters that if they stay home \"that means the conservatives are going to do a deal with the Greens and then they'll throw the borders open the immigrants will pour in,\" Heinisch says. \"The slogan that the Freedom Party is posting is, 'we need to be strong so we can keep the conservatives on the right path.' \" For the Freedom Party, that means reconciling with Kurz, who remains popular. \"He's no longer the messianic figure of Austrian politics he was a couple of years ago,\" Heinisch says. \"But he's handsome, he's rhetorically gifted, he's young and, to a lot of conservatives, represents the future.\" There's even a campaign commercial showing the new Freedom Party leader, Norbert Hofer, in couples therapy with an actor portraying Kurz. The men tell a therapist how much they like and respect each other and how they share ideas. They sometimes answer questions in unison. \"We have so much in common,\" Hofer says in the video. \"We just need a little push to get back together.\" Benjamin Breitegger contributed reporting from Vienna.",

            "article_content": "Trump doubles down on racist remarks directed at freshmen congresswomen of color. White House implements a new rule for asylum-seekers. And, big tech comes to Capitol Hill for congressional hearings.  STEVE INSKEEP, HOST: How do four Americans respond to the president suggesting they leave? NOEL KING, HOST: All four of them are members of the House of Representatives. They are Democrats Rashida Tlaib, Ayanna Pressley, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Ilhan Omar. Omar yesterday pointed out that the president, who complained about their complaining, is noted for his loud and frequent complaining. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) ILHAN OMAR: For him to condemn us and to say we are un-American for wanting to work hard to make this country be the country we all deserve to live in - complete hypocrisy. KING: She was responding to President Trump saying that these women of color should, quote, \"go back to where they came from.\" INSKEEP: Mostly, they were born in the United States. Now, how is the president explaining himself? NPR lead political editor Domenico Montanaro is with us once again. Domenico, good morning. DOMENICO MONTANARO, BYLINE: Good morning, Steve. INSKEEP: OK, so he begins by saying these people mostly born in the U.S. should go back. They're people who are from here but just of a different race than him. And then he came out and made a statement - the president did - saying, well, what I meant was if you don't like America, you can leave. But isn't he pretty much saying the same thing? MONTANARO: Right. I mean, the president showed no contrition, essentially, for racist remarks. He instead - he emphasized them. He said, if you hate our country, if you're not happy here, you can leave. Now, the rhetoric has gone too far for many Republicans. They're voicing disapproval of the president's remarks. They're also criticizing the congresswomen, though, calling them socialists or far-left or, quote, \"anti-Semitic\" - using anti-Semitic rhetoric. Most of them, though, stopped short of calling the tweets racist. You heard from Will Hurd of Texas, who is black, who called Trump's tweets racist, as did Mike Turner of Ohio. But others like Pat Toomey of Pennsylvania, Susan Collins of Maine, Mitt Romney of Utah - they called the remarks, you know, destructive, demeaning, disunifying and, also, over the line, which I guess, Steve, means there is a line. INSKEEP: Oh. Well, interesting to learn that. Why would the president go over that line, then? MONTANARO: You know, the fact is the president and the Republican Party want to elevate these four congresswomen to make them the, quote, \"face of the Democratic Party\" - you heard Lindsey Graham say that on Fox News yesterday, for example. You know, they think that that is something that helps them because it makes the Democratic Party look far-left. Ayanna Pressley argued that the congresswomen's views are not total outliers. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) AYANNA PRESSLEY: Our squad is big. Our squad includes any person committed to building a more equitable and just world. And that is the work that we want to get back to. INSKEEP: I guess we should define some terms there. They've been called the squad, these four freshmen members of Congress. And when she says, our squad is big, she's referring to - she's asserting that, actually, they have a lot of support; they're not just four freshmen. MONTANARO: Right. And the fact, though, is that within the Democratic conference, they've had some disagreement with leadership, with Nancy Pelosi, whether it's tactically or ideologically. But for now, I have to say, this helps Nancy Pelosi. It's a pretty big gift to her to maintain unity because, instead of the focus being on that Democratic infighting, it's on Trump. And Pelosi is now calling on Congress to condemn Trump's remarks and wants to put Republicans on record. INSKEEP: Although, the way that Republicans will spin this is, look - all the Democrats have now been glued to these four lawmakers that we want to describe as socialist and so forth. So what does this mean for the 2020 election? MONTANARO: Well, they'll certainly attempt that. But this whole incident's a reminder that identity politics are going to be, unavoidably, a top issue for 2020. Republicans and the Trump campaign are happy to have it that way. They think it helps them. They think it throws the left off balance. But stepping back, Steve, the fabric of the country is really being stretched. I mean, you have demographic change in this country that's upsetting half the country, while the other half is painting in primary colors, emboldened. They feel under siege by Trump. And, you know, it's unclear what it's going to mean for 2020 at the ballot box next year, and it's even cloudier for our culture and what it means to be American. INSKEEP: One of the questions, of course, will be who gets the half or a little more than half or a little less than half? Domenico, thanks so much. MONTANARO: You're so welcome. INSKEEP: That's Domenico Montanaro. Now, amid all the attention on the president's racist language, his administration continued its push to reshape immigration policy. KING: Yeah, that's right. Yesterday, the Trump administration announced a new rule for migrants from Central America who want to get asylum in the U.S. They first have to apply for asylum in a country that they traveled through on their way to the United States, and if they're rejected by one of those countries, only then can they seek asylum here. Now, that rule is scheduled to go into effect today, and it will certainly face challenges in court. INSKEEP: Reporter James Fredrick is in Mexico City and covering this story. Hey. Good morning JAMES FREDRICK, BYLINE: Morning, Steve. INSKEEP: So I'm trying to figure this out - if you show up at the U.S.-Mexico border and say, I'm seeking asylum, is the asylum officer, the federal agent there, going to say, OK, prove to me you tried in Guatemala first? FREDRICK: Exactly. I mean, what this establishes is that, if you show up at the U.S. border now to request asylum, basically, you're not - ineligible unless you can prove you've tried to apply elsewhere and have been rejected. So, I mean, this applies to everyone who's coming to the southern border. The administration says that this policy is to crack down on what it calls fraudulent asylum claims. But the result is that someone who could have been granted asylum yesterday had they been able to apply, well, today that same person can't even apply and could be deported to their home country. In terms of who this affects, we're talking mostly people from Central America. But it's not just them; it's anyone who's come through Mexico. I've met people from as far as Venezuela, the Congo, Ukraine who have come through here to apply for asylum. It would affect all of them. And the question now is how - what this looks like on the ground. One question is what do they do with people who break this rule now? Will they deport them to their home country, to a place where they say they're not safe? That's a big question right now. INSKEEP: Now, I want to think this through. First, we should note - this is kind of normal, that you encourage people to just go one country over and stay near where they came from. I mean, refugees from Afghanistan end up in Pakistan or Iran, for example. So it's not that unusual to have the impulse to say, if you're fleeing El Salvador, maybe you should go to Guatemala, maybe you should just go to Mexico, you should go somewhere nearby. But that does raise a question - can people get asylum? Can people be safe in Guatemala or Mexico? FREDRICK: In theory, yes. In practice, in a place like Guatemala - Guatemala officially does allow asylum-seekers, but it doesn't have an office to even process that. So, I mean, the capacity for it just doesn't exist right now. In Mexico, it's a bit different; Mexico does process tens of thousands of asylum requests a year. The problem right now is that Mexico's asylum office has an annual budget of $1.2 million. They've already had 30,000 asylum requests this year. They just have nowhere near the funds to resettle more people or even the number of people who are requesting asylum right now. So practically, it just doesn't seem feasible in other countries like that. INSKEEP: Have Mexican officials indicated they're going to try to deal with this? FREDRICK: They have not said anything. They mostly said that this is a domestic policy in the U.S., so they can't challenge it. But what they're going to do is a big question because this would be a huge burden on them to take tens of thousands of more people, possibly. INSKEEP: Reporter James Fredrick, in Mexico City. Thanks, as always. FREDRICK: Thanks, Steve. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) INSKEEP: OK, wow - three congressional hearings today in Washington, three of them, put the power struggle between Congress and big tech on display. KING: And when we talk about big tech, we're talking about a handful of companies - Facebook, Amazon, Google and Apple. Some members of Congress are concerned about the influence that these companies have over billions of people's lives. And today, lawmakers get to question executives from those companies. INSKEEP: NPR's Aarti Shahani will be listening and is on the line. Good morning. AARTI SHAHANI, BYLINE: Good morning. INSKEEP: OK, let's start with Facebook, which is the sole focus of a hearing before the Senate Banking Committee. Why banking? SHAHANI: That's right. So you may have heard Facebook plans to create its own money called the Libra. The stated goal is to bank the unbanked. An estimated 1.7 billion adult on Earth do not have a bank account; many of them are Facebook users. So Facebook is going to create its own currency, taking on a key power of nation-states - the power to mint money. But Facebook has got to clear a lot of hurdles. What are they and their partners going to do about money laundering? How will they protect privacy? What happens to the interest earned on Libra deposits? Regulators are speaking up about it and striking very different tones. France's finance minister came out saying Facebook shouldn't have a sovereign currency. The U.K. minister says his country is willing to engage with Facebook. And U.S. Treasury Secretary Stephen Mnuchin made it clear in a briefing yesterday that he is not comfortable with Facebook launching a currency, at least not yet. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) STEVEN MNUCHIN: I think they're being very candid with the administration in where they are. I'm not going to publicly speculate how long I think it will take them to get to the point where we're comfortable with it. But they are a long way away. INSKEEP: Facebook by now, of course, has heard some of the criticism. How are they responding? SHAHANI: So the company is sending David Marcus. He's heading the creation of this Libra wallet. He used to head PayPal. His testimony, which he submitted, it's very diplomatic. He's going to say Facebook will not launch Libra until his team has fully addressed regulatory concerns and received appropriate approvals. So, you know, it seems like, at least today, Facebook is talking the talk. INSKEEP: And we'll find out how the walk goes a little bit later. SHAHANI: (Laughter) That's right. That's right. INSKEEP: In the House, some lawmakers are asking if some of these companies amount to monopolies. SHAHANI: That is correct, and there is an entire hearing today that's really dedicated to how these platforms work. The House Judiciary Committee members are going to drill into Facebook, Google, Amazon and Apple - how they deal with competitors and collaborators. And, you know, Steve, here's the thing - is that these companies do have differences. For example, Amazon and Google both collect advertising money. But Amazon's ad money is basically a fee to vendors for them to show up in Amazon's search pages; Google is not that. As one person close to the companies pointed out to me, it is in each of their interests to not point fingers at each other, to not throw each other under the bus. They'll want to stick together and make the antitrust conversation go away. INSKEEP: Kind of act like, I don't know, a big tech monopoly or something like that. SHAHANI: (Laughter) Well, and coordinated - coordinated, correct. INSKEEP: (Laughter) Coordinated messaging - that's something different, I know, I know, I know. SHAHANI: Yes. INSKEEP: Third hearing is about what actually gets carried on social media and what allegedly gets blocked. SHAHANI: That's right. That's right. Senator Ted Cruz, he has long criticized social media platforms for anti-conservative bias. Today, he's going to grill a Google lobbyist, specifically, on whether the company is tweaking its algorithms, manipulating search to suppress certain ideologies. So, again, does big tech have too much power? INSKEEP: Can't wait for people to be googling the results of that hearing to see whether it comes up. SHAHANI: (Laughter). INSKEEP: Aarti, thanks so much. SHAHANI: Thank you. INSKEEP: That's NPR's Aarti Shahani. (SOUNDBITE OF STAN FOREBEE'S \"REFLECTIONS\") Copyright \u00a9 2019 NPR.  All rights reserved.

Europe's traditional centrist coalition lost its majority in the European Union's parliamentary elections Sunday, with far-right populist parties and liberal, pro-European Union parties both gaining ground. The results suggest a complicated future for the EU, as voters look for new ways forward. More than 50% of European voters turned out last week to vote in the parliamentary elections, the highest turnout in two decades and a sharp increase from the last election in 2014. Here's what you need to know about the results. The center-right group known as the European People's Party (EPP) and the center-left Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats (S&D) held 54% of the seats before the vote. Now they're down to 43%, according to Sunday's results. The two blocs together lost more than 70 seats, along with the majority they held for decades, according to NPR's Sylvia Poggioli. The results suggest that European centrists will have to reach out to and unite more broadly with liberal coalitions in order to effect change \u2014 and maintain authority \u2014 in the EU. Matteo Salvini, Italy's Deputy Prime Minister and leader of the right-wing League party, speaks at a news conference following the European Parliament election results on Monday in Milan.\n                \n                    \n                    Emanuele Cremaschi/Getty Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption Matteo Salvini, Italy's Deputy Prime Minister and leader of the right-wing League party, speaks at a news conference following the European Parliament election results on Monday in Milan. Populist, euroskeptic parties across Europe saw gains, but less than what some preelection polls had predicted \u2014 and what pro-EU forces had feared. And the various nationalist parties' differences over issues like migration and attitudes toward Russia could cloud prospects for a united right. \"What happened was not really what a lot of people were fearing, that there would be a surge of the far-right populists,\" former Swedish Prime Minister and now co-chair of the European Council on Foreign Relations Carl Bildt told NPR on Monday. \"There was an increase by the far-right, but fairly marginal and far less than what people had predicted.\" Because the gains were smaller than expected, the far-right likely won't be able to reshape the future of Europe by itself, says NPR's Poggioli, but it may be able to obstruct the legislative process. Many attribute the victories on the far-right to high unemployment rates, security concerns after several terrorist attacks and tensions over migration. In France, the far-right National Rally party of Marine Le Pen narrowly beat  French President Emmanuel Macron's party coalition. Though Le Pen's party won by less than 1%, with 23% of the vote, she dubbed it a \"victory for the people\" on Twitter. The League, Italy's far-right populist party led by Deputy Prime Minister Matteo Salvini, saw a sweeping victory, garnering more than 34% of the country's vote. \"Not only is the League the top party in Italy, Marine Le Pen is the top party in France, Nigel Farage is the top party in the U.K. So Italy, France, the U.K., it's a sign of a Europe that's changing,\" Salvini said at a press conference after the victory. In Hungary, the nationalist Fidesz party of Prime Minister Viktor Orb\u00e1n took more than 52% of the vote. In Austria, conservative Chancellor Sebastian Kurz's Austrian People's Party won the election Sunday, but Kurz was ousted Monday when he lost a no-confidence vote stemming from a scandal that erupted last week over its coalition partner, the far-right Freedom Party. That party fared worse than it had in the previous European election. Though many of the far-right parties of Europe share the goal of weakening the European Union, they clash on other pressing issues. In Italy, for instance, Salvini, though anti-immigration, has advocated for the relocation of asylum seekers across the EU. Hungary's Orb\u00e1n has pushed to close borders. \"We reject migration; and we would like to see leaders in position in the European Union who reject migration, who would like to stop it and not manage it,\" Orb\u00e1n wrote in a statement after casting his vote Sunday. The Greens, a party coalition focusing on environmental issues, went from 52 seats in the European Parliament in 2014 to 69 in 2019, making them the fourth largest voting bloc in the EU. Members and supporters of the Greens coalition celebrate in Berlin after the announcement of the first forecast for the European elections.\n                \n                    \n                    Kay Nietfeld/Picture Alliance Via Getty Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption Members and supporters of the Greens coalition celebrate in Berlin after the announcement of the first forecast for the European elections. The results, the strongest ever for the Greens, indicate that many Europeans are growing increasingly concerned about climate change and the environment. Recently, across northern Europe, young people have been protesting what they see as governmental inaction on combating climate change. In Germany, the Greens took 21% of the vote, second only to German Chancellor Angela Merkel's Christian Democrats, part of the center-right EPP European parliamentary bloc. Since the last election in 2014, Merkel's party lost 6 percentage points, while the Greens gained nearly 10 points. The Greens also saw gains in France, the Netherlands, Ireland, Finland, Denmark and Belgium, among others. \"The Greens and the Liberals were the winners of the day,\" Sweden's Carl Bildt told NPR. Brexit Party leader Nigel Farage arrives at a Brexit party on Monday in London.\n                \n                    \n                    Peter Summers/Getty Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption Brexit Party leader Nigel Farage arrives at a Brexit party on Monday in London. Voters in the United Kingdom weren't initially even supposed to participate in this election; they were supposed to have left the EU by the end of March. But with several delays \u2014 and plans for leaving now set for October \u2014 U.K. voters had to take part, and gave the new Brexit Party, led by populist Nigel Farage, more than 30% of the vote. In contrast, Prime Minister Theresa May's Conservative Party ended up in fifth place, with 8.7% of the vote. \"This is the worst showing by the Conservative Party since the 1830s,\" says NPR's Frank Langfitt. The Labour Party also fared poorly, down 10 percentage points since 2014. Both the Labour and Conservative parties wavered on finding a clear position on Brexit, and the vote seems to indicate, Langfitt says, that voters rewarded clarity on the issue of leaving the EU. Liberal Democrats and other pro-EU parties did well. \"Never before in British politics has a new party, launched just six weeks ago, topped the polls in a national election,\" Farage said after his election as a member of the European Parliament. \"There's a huge message here, a massive message here.\"",

            "article_content": "Centrists in Europe have lost their majority. After Europe's parliamentary elections over the weekend, nationalist and far-right parties got a boost in their share of power.  NOEL KING, HOST: Over the weekend, the European Union held parliamentary elections. And this morning, we're getting the results. Voter turnout was high, and it left the EU's traditional center splintered. OK. We're going to have two views from Europe this morning, starting in Rome with NPR's Sylvia Poggioli. Hi, Sylvia. SYLVIA POGGIOLI, BYLINE: Hi, Noel. KING: So let's start with the 3,000-foot view of results across the European Union. Who gained and who lost? POGGIOLI: Well, you know, the populists did well in some places, but there was no hard-right takeover of the EU Parliament. As you said, turnout was high - 51% compared to 43% five years ago. Many young pro-EU voters cast ballots for Greens Parties. They did very well in northern Europe. The populists won enough to deprive the center-left and center-right parties of the parliamentary majority they held for 40 years. So the centrists will have to create a wider alliance with other parties, but they've ruled out a coalition with the hard-right. In the end, the populists will get only around 25% of Parliament's seats. Nevertheless, there were some big populist victories. Here's Italy's Deputy Prime Minister Matteo Salvini, leader of the victorious hard-right league. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) MATTEO SALVINI: (Speaking Italian). POGGIOLI: He said, \"not only is the League the top party in Italy, Marine Le Pen is the top party in France. Nigel Farage is the top party in the U.K.\" So Italy, France, the U.K. - it's a sign of a Europe that's changing. In fact, Marine Le Pen's hard-right party came in ahead of French President Emmanuel Macron's party. That's seen as an embarrassment for the champion of a stronger EU. And Italy's League is now the biggest party in the EU Parliament, winning 34%. KING: What is going on? What helped these far-right populist groups win so many seats this time around? POGGIOLI: Anger at EU bureaucrats for failing to deal with the economic stagnation and high unemployment in southern Europe after the global financial crisis and security concerns after several terrorist attacks. But most of all, it's the huge migrant influx over the last several years. Populist parties whipped up fear and anxiety with slogans like, invasion, and the threat to Europe's Judeo-Christian values. One of the most outspoken populists on this issue is Hungary's autocratic Prime Minister Viktor Orban, whose party scored more than 50% in the vote. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) PRIME MINISTER VIKTOR ORBAN: We reject migration. And we would like to see leaders in position of European Unions who reject the migration, who would like to stop it and not to manage it. KING: All right. So these far-right nationalist parties gained some seats in this election. What do they do with them now? POGGIOLI: Well, they'll probably be more spoilers than promoters of radical change because they're divided on many issues. Italy's Salvini wants looser rules on budgetary discipline, but German and other northern European populists reject that. Salvini wants other EU states to take in many asylum-seekers who landed in Italy, but Hungary's Orban and other east Europeans say, no way. And there's Russia. Salvini and Le Pen admire Vladimir Putin, while the ruling populist party in Poland and other east European parties are wary of Russia's aims. So populists won't be able to reshape the European Union in their image, but they could obstruct and seriously slow down the legislative process. KING: NPR's Sylvia Poggioli in Rome. Thanks, Sylvia. POGGIOLI: Thank you, Noel. KING: All right. Let's go over to the United Kingdom, where the new Brexit Party stormed to victory. Outgoing Prime Minister Theresa May's Conservative Party suffered an historic defeat, and NPR's Frank Langfitt is traveling outside of London. Hey, Frank. FRANK LANGFITT, BYLINE: Hey, Noel. KING: So we said that the Brexit Party did well. How well did they do exactly? And how did they pull this off? LANGFITT: They did a fabulous job. They - most of the ballots are now counted, and they got over 30% of the vote. Remember, this is a party that hadn't been around - only been around for a number of weeks, really. The ruling Conservative's a completely different story. They're under 10%, ending up in fifth place. This is the worst showing by the Conservative Party since the 1830s. The other major party, Labour - they did badly as well. They ended up in third place. And I think what's really going on here, Noel, is that neither of these major parties ever staked out a clear position on Brexit. We've had paralysis here for three years politically in the country. And this left space for the Brexit Party and, of course, Nigel Farage - he's a very charismatic leader of the party - to basically take this ground and scoop up lots and lots of voters who want to get out of the EU and, frankly, want to get out of it now. KING: I mean, it doesn't change the fact that British politics broadly are still in chaos. What are... LANGFITT: It is. KING: ...The lessons from this vote? LANGFITT: You know, I think the lessons here are voters want clarity. They want to know exactly what a party is going to do at this crucial moment in the country's history. And the parties that had clear positions on Brexit - like the Brexit Party - did very well. What's interesting is that you're going to now see, I think, candidates for prime minister on the Tory side - they are going to be talking a lot more about the idea of a no-deal Brexit, of just walking away from the European Union, even though every economist you talk to - for the most part - says that's going to cause a lot of damage. But both parties, I think - what you've seen after, you know, years of fudging and kind of fumbling, they've got to stake out clear positions on this big issue. KING: Well, going into this, we heard that this vote was seen as a proxy for a second referendum on Brexit. Given that the Brexit Party did so well, does that mean that Britons would vote to leave the EU again if they had the chance? LANGFITT: No, not necessarily. And while I think the Brexit Party deserves a ton of credit for what they've done - they've only been around - they've been around for less than two months. So what we have is, three years on, still an incredibly polarized United Kingdom and no path forward. So even as we have these votes, you see just how people are so set against each other on this huge issue. KING: NPR's Frank Langfitt outside of London. Thanks, Frank. LANGFITT: Happy to do it, Noel.

            "article_content": "Trump's immigration stance appears to be influenced by adviser Stephen Miller. Nearly all the votes are counted in Israel's parliamentary elections. EU leaders meet for a Brexit summit.  DAVID GREENE, HOST: There are more departures at the Department of Homeland Security. The second-in-command there, Claire Grady, offered her resignation last night. And she'll be leaving office today, the same day outgoing secretary Kirstjen Nielsen is departing. RACHEL MARTIN, HOST: Grady's exit paves the way for Kevin McAleenan, the commissioner of the U.S. Borders - Customs and Border Protection Agency. He's going to take over as the Department of Homeland Security's acting secretary. This is all part of a shift by President Trump, who says he wants an even tougher approach to immigration. That shift appears to be heavily influenced by the president's senior policy adviser, Stephen Miller. GREENE: And let's learn more about the man who seems to be behind a lot of the president's border policies inside the White House. NPR national political correspondent Mara Liasson is here to talk about him. Hi, Mara. MARA LIASSON, BYLINE: Hi, David. GREENE: So who is Stephen Miller? LIASSON: Stephen Miller is a young White House aide who's been with Donald Trump since the beginning of the campaign. Before that, he worked for former attorney general Jeff Sessions in the Senate. And Miller has been an immigration restrictionist since long before Trump ran. He has an interesting background. He grew up as a teenage conservative contrarian in liberal Santa Monica, Calif. And then he became a right-wing media star when he was a college student at Duke University. But he got an opportunity with Trump. Now he's the strongest voice inside the White House on immigration. The president has tasked him with this, said he's in charge of immigration policy. He really knows his brief. He's also been one of the most fiercely loyal defenders of Donald Trump on television. And here he is in... GREENE: Which Trump loves. I mean, that's very important to be in... LIASSON: Yes, very important. Here he is in 2017 talking about the Muslim ban, which is the first big restrictionist immigration fight that the president picked. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) STEPHEN MILLER: Our opponents, the media and the whole world will soon see, as we begin to take further actions, that the powers of the president to protect our country are very substantial and will not be questioned. LIASSON: So, yes, the president's powers on immigration are substantial. But they also have been questioned by other institutions, like Congress and the courts. And one of the reasons that Donald Trump was so frustrated with Kirstjen Nielsen was that, even though she didn't push back against his immigration goals, she would explain to him, on occasion, that some of what he wanted to do was probably unconstitutional. She was a reality check he didn't want. But now, with the house cleaning at the Department of Homeland Security, Trump gets to remake the personnel in charge of immigration more in his own image. And Miller will be guiding that. GREENE: OK. Well, if he's - I mean, he's remaking the personnel and, in theory, remaking the policy to make it tougher. But what exactly would that mean? What would it look like? LIASSON: Some of the things that the president wants we know about. He wants a wall. He wants to stop the immigration lottery. He wants to stop chain migration. There's been some talk at the White House about creating an immigration czar. The president has also talked about maybe stopping the asylum process altogether or closing the border, putting punitive tariffs on Mexico if they don't stop immigration. And what he wants to do is find deterrents to make it harder for asylum seekers to get in so that he can stop this surge at the border. GREENE: That's something - I mean, the kinds of things you're talking about - even without Kristen Nielsen as the reality check, like you said, I mean, there's another reality check, which is Congress, right? LIASSON: Right. And the president has been either unwilling or unable to make a deal with Congress. But White House officials believe that just changing some regulations at DHS, they could accomplish a lot. For instance, they'd like to toughen up the criteria for credible fear. They believe that immigration officials have a, quote, \"reflexive tendency to believe asylum seekers.\" They want DHS to give fewer work permits to people in the asylum process. The White House believes, even without congressional action, that would make a big dent in the numbers of asylum seekers and asylum winners. GREENE: OK. So some executive moves that the president could theoretically make here. That's NPR national political correspondent Mara Liasson. Mara, thanks. LIASSON: Thank you. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) GREENE: All right. Benjamin Netanyahu is fighting for his political survival after one of the closest-fought elections in Israeli history. MARTIN: Yeah. Israelis went to the polls yesterday, cast their votes. Exit polls showed a race too close to call. Both Benjamin Netanyahu and his rival, Benny Gantz, declared victory at their respective rallies last night. The question now is who is better positioned to form a government? GREENE: All right. Let's turn to NPR's Daniel Estrin, who is in Jerusalem. Hi, Daniel. DANIEL ESTRIN, BYLINE: Good morning. GREENE: So what is the latest here? I mean, does Benjamin Netanyahu have a clear path to victory here? ESTRIN: It looks like Netanyahu has the best chances. Over 90 - over 97 percent of the votes have been counted, and it looks like the prime minister is set to extend his term. He and his centrist challenger, the retired general, Benny Gantz, were tied in the number of seats they won so far, as the votes have been counted. But to become prime minister, you need to form a coalition of parties that adds up to a majority in parliament. And there is a clear majority, so far, of right-wing parties that won. And that would make it easiest for Netanyahu to form the government. GREENE: What did this election feel like on the streets, I mean, as you were speaking with Israelis as they were voting yesterday? ESTRIN: It was really interesting. I think, when I spoke to people voting for Gantz, the centrist, they seemed resigned to the fact that he didn't have a great chance of unseating Netanyahu. But they thought, well, if anyone had a chance to do it, he would. And here's what a left-wing voter, a 43-year-old woman named Yael Levine (ph), told me. YAEL LEVINE: I have very little hope, but we have to have hope. We just have to hope that even center parties can move us forward. ESTRIN: And the Netanyahu voters I met were actually very confident in him. And they said Israel's economy's doing really well. People are feeling secure here. And when I asked, well, what about the corruption allegations that Netanyahu faces? Well, listen to what Tzvi Gudin (ph), a 29-year-old voter, said. TZVI GUDIN: Right now, everything is clear. For me, until there'll be a trial, there'll be a sentence, he's to me as clear as snow. ESTRIN: So a lot of Netanyahu's voters said to me they didn't really care or they were skeptical about the allegations. GREENE: What about the mood among Palestinians, at this moment, in the West Bank and Gaza Strip? What are they saying? ESTRIN: Well, Palestinians in the Palestinian territories don't have the right to vote in Israeli elections. And Palestinian official Saeb Erekat said that the results look bad for the prospects of ending Israel's occupation of the West Bank. Here's what he said. SAEB EREKAT: They want their occupation to be endless. And they want us to live under a continued, deeper apartheid system than the one that existed in the darkest hours of South Africa's apartheid. ESTRIN: And actually, just days before elections, Netanyahu vowed to annex Jewish settlements in the West Bank if he's re-elected. And that could make it impossible for Israel and the Palestinians to reach a peace deal. GREENE: So, Daniel, assuming that Netanyahu remains in power - I mean, one of the voters you spoke to brought up, you know, until there is a trial, talking about these corruption allegations looming over him. Do those allegations pose a threat if he stays in power for now? ESTRIN: They could, David. Within months, Netanyahu is likely to face an indictment. Once that happens, it could spell the beginning of the end for him. At least one of the parties expected to join a possible Netanyahu government may not stay by his side. And Netanyahu's own party could start preparing for the day after. GREENE: All right. The latest on that very close Israeli election yesterday - NPR's Daniel Estrin in Jerusalem. Daniel, thanks. ESTRIN: Sure thing. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) GREENE: Well, here's a headline - Brexit remains a total mess. MARTIN: Yes, it does. Politicians in the United Kingdom still cannot agree on a way to leave the European Union, which is why the prime minister, Theresa May, is heading to Brussels today to ask the EU for yet another extension. This is before the clock runs out on Friday morning. Recently, she's been in Berlin. She has been in Paris trying to get support from German chancellor Angela Merkel and French president Emmanuel Macron. GREENE: And let's turn to our own Mr. Brexit - Frank Langfitt in London. Hi, Frank. You interested in... FRANK LANGFITT, BYLINE: Hey... GREENE: ...Covering something else at some point (laughter)? LANGFITT: At some point, but we'll have to see how tonight goes. GREENE: Well, what exactly is the prime minister asking for this time? LANGFITT: She - well, she wants a short extension to June 30. And the reason is just as you guys were mentioning - she needs more time to find some consensus in this country on how to leave the European Union. She's also under a lot of pressure from Brexiteers here to just get out as soon as possible. And the other thing is she wants to avoid having to seat U.K. members in the European parliament. The new parliament opens in early July. So that's what she's asking for. GREENE: Well, what kind of response is she going to get from European Union leaders who, I mean, have been getting impatient for... LANGFITT: Yeah. They're... GREENE: ...Like, forever now. LANGFITT: Exactly. Well, the EU is exasperated. But we are expecting that there will be some kind of extension. And that's because the EU, as we've said before, doesn't want the U.K. to crash out of this trading block with no arrangements or plans on Friday night. Also, the EU, though, is going to want to hear some kind of plan on how to break this deadlock in the British parliament. Donald Tusk - he's the president of the European Council - he is suggesting a long extension, could be up to a year. And one of the reasons for that is he wants to avoid the U.K. just continuing to blow through these deadlines, which we've been talking about, and also, frankly, dominating the EU agenda. Now, any kind of extension would probably have conditions, and one would be to keep the U.K. from disrupting the EU while it remains inside. There's a concern here that once the prime minister - Prime Minister May - leaves, a Brexiteer prime minister could come in and actually try to muck things up in the EU. So there are going to be probably some pretty tough conditions if there's any extension. GREENE: Frank, can I ask you this? I mean, you have these EU leaders. And what we've heard is that no one wants to be that veto necessarily who forces... LANGFITT: Oh, no. I don't think so. GREENE: ...Britain out, I mean... LANGFITT: No. GREENE: ...And crash. But they all have to respond to their own voters as well. I mean, we know that Brexit's divided British society. What is the view from the European continent of all this? LANGFITT: It's really interesting, David. I was in Copenhagen over the weekend, and I was talking to Danish friends. And the response that I got was people cannot believe the bitterness, the anger, the chaos that they've seen in the parliament here that many in Europe really admired for a long time. Another pointed out that the U.K. is Denmark's closest ally, and he just feels really sad about it. Interestingly, the chaos of Brexit has actually helped the EU's image on the continent. I was speaking last week to George Papaconstantinou. He's the former finance minister for Greece. And this is what he said. GEORGE PAPACONSTANTINOU: Brexit has made Europeans realize more clearly what they have. It has made people realize that peace, prosperity and a common destiny that we've all been taking for granted for such a long time is something brittle that, if you don't protect and nurture, you could lose. GREENE: Wow. That's quite reflective about this moment. What an interesting view to hear. LANGFITT: It is. And I think that, really, in some ways, in the short run, Brexit has actually been good for the EU. GREENE: Tonight in Brussels, another big decision on the U.K.'s long and - can we say - tortured path out of the EU. And NPR's Frank Langfitt in London will be covering it. Frank, thank you. LANGFITT: Happy to do it, David. (SOUNDBITE OF THRUPENCE'S \"FOREST ON THE SUN\") Copyright \u00a9 2019 NPR.  All rights reserved.

            "article_content": "Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen is leaving her post. Israelis go to the polls Tuesday to decide if Prime Minister Netanyahu stays in power. And, U.S. troops evacuate from Libya.  DAVID GREENE, HOST: A month ago, Kirstjen Nielsen went before Congress and told a House committee this. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) KIRSTJEN NIELSEN: We face a crisis - a real, serious and sustained crisis at our borders. We have tens of thousands of illegal aliens arriving at our doorstep every month. We have drugs, criminals and violence spilling into our country every week. RACHEL MARTIN, HOST: The secretary of Homeland Security was the person in charge of implementing President Trump's hard line on immigration, which included separating children from their families. President Trump confirmed Nielsen's departure in a tweet yesterday, thanking her for her service. The president also confirmed that the current commissioner of the U.S. Customs and Border Protection Agency, the CBP - his name is Kevin McAleenan - he's going to serve as acting secretary. GREENE: And let's talk about this move with NPR lead political editor Domenico Montanaro. Hi, Domenico. DOMENICO MONTANARO, BYLINE: Hey there, David. GREENE: So talk about Kirstjen Nielsen's time at Homeland Security. What is her legacy? MONTANARO: Well, it was a controversial one. She oversaw the family separation policy that saw thousands of children separated from their parents and detained, including those seeking asylum. But she also often clashed with the president. He wanted her to go further in taking a hard line on clamping down, especially as migrant border crossings have gone up in recent months. GREENE: So is that why she's leaving - the president wanted her to be even tougher than she was? MONTANARO: He did. I mean, it's been a pretty rocky relationship. You know, Trump was pretty skeptical of her from the beginning because of her ties to the Bush administration and because she was pretty close to his former chief of staff, John Kelly. But what we know now about her departure is that the - in the administration's that Nielsen met with Trump yesterday afternoon. After that meeting, she tendered their - her resignation. She touted her legacy. She tried to keep the focus on the fact that she tried to keep the border secure, but she expressed frustration with Congress and her ability within the law to be able to do more. The president wanted her to limit asylum-seekers, for example, who he last week said weren't people, but animals. And now this is really a department that's facing a leadership crisis. Trump withdrew his nomination, remember, for the head of Immigration and Customs Enforcement - ICE - and just named the head of Customs and Border Protection to lead the agency while he threatened to close the border last week. GREENE: So a lot happening at a moment when there is going to be this leadership vacuum, it seems. And you mentioned ICE, Domenico. When the president dropped his nominee to lead that agency, he told reporters he wants a tougher direction. What does that mean for his immigration policy? And what does this mean in terms of the political challenges that a new secretary might face here? MONTANARO: Right. Well, I mean, the new challenges are going to be the same as the old challenges. You know, a secretary is going to come in dealing with a president not happy about immigration law limitations, you know, who - somebody who's saying that the country is, quote, \"full\" - he tweeted last night - and asking the secretary to, quote, \"be creative about stopping immigration.\" You know, overall, though, I really do think - I mean, when you talk about the politics of this, we should remember this is less about any secretary and more about Trump himself. Curbing immigration was Trump's core, fundamental issue that helped launch him onto the national scene, really, and get elected. And we're talking here a year before he faces re-election before voters, he wants to continue to channel this grievance about demographic and social, cultural change in a country that's really at a pivot point on this issue. MARTIN: There's also a lot of acting happening right now, we should just say. MONTANARO: Yeah. MARTIN: There is currently in the country not a confirmed secretary of defense and now an acting character in at Homeland Security. MONTANARO: Absolutely. GREENE: Acting is a new title, it seems like, in leadership in the country at the moment. NPR's Domenico Montanaro - Domenico, thanks. We appreciate it. MONTANARO: You're so welcome. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) GREENE: All right. Israelis are going to the polls tomorrow, really, with one main question to answer. Should Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu remain in power? MARTIN: He's been in office for a decade. And if he's re-elected, he'll be on track to become the longest-serving prime minister in Israel's history. But Netanyahu has some challenges this go-round - corruption charges against him, and he's facing his toughest competitor in years, a former military chief of staff named Benny Gantz. Polling suggests a close race in the final hours. And over the weekend, Netanyahu made a dramatic campaign pledge. GREENE: And let's hear about that from NPR's Daniel Estrin, who is in Jerusalem. Good morning, Daniel. DANIEL ESTRIN, BYLINE: Hi. Good morning. GREENE: So this pledge - Netanyahu saying that he would annex parts of the occupied West Bank - explain what that means and why it's so significant. ESTRIN: He says he'll gradually impose sovereignty over Jewish settlements. He's basically saying, I'm keeping Israelis in the West Bank forever. That's not up for negotiation with the Palestinians. But this is a last-minute campaign promise. I think we have to take it with a grain of salt. He's trying to rally his base here. And the truth is that he has resisted this kind of move for years. It would draw really enormous international condemnation. But you know what? There's a big but there. The Trump administration declined comment on Netanyahu's campaign promise about annexation. And his party really wants it to happen. And if he wins re-election, he could take steps towards that. And I think for Palestinians watching these elections, that's - it's a sign of how dim the prospects are for peace and also how little say they have in this election. GREENE: So what are the polls suggesting at this point? I mean, what are Netanyahu's chances for staying in power? ESTRIN: It's a really close race. This former military general who's trying to beat Netanyahu, he's a centrist. But polls are showing that most Israelis are going to vote for right-wing parties. There are, like - probably, like, a dozen parties running in this election. And if most Israelis vote for right-wing parties, that would give Netanyahu the best chance of forming a coalition and winning. And last night, I was at the market here in Jerusalem. I spoke to some young voters drinking coffee. And they said, Netanyahu's done a good job. We're just sick of him after 10 years. But guess who they're going to vote for? They say that they're going to be voting for candidates even further to the right of Netanyahu. And next to them, I met a young high school civics teacher, Yahav Shadmi (ph). And he says he's liberal. He teaches at an elite high school here that tends to be more liberal. But he said the school held mock elections, and there was strong support for right-wing candidates, even far-right candidates. Here's what he said. YAHAV SHADMI: We could see that the radical racism discourse into the student's mind. Peace is not any option anymore. Even the left-wing parties don't really talk about peace. They talking about agreements. GREENE: Well, Daniel, you've reported a lot on Israel's shift further and further to the right during Netanyahu's time in power. I mean, what - tell us about what you've learned. ESTRIN: I've learned that attitudes toward democracy have changed here. Israel has always branded itself as being both Jewish and democratic. But Netanyahu's government has prioritized Israel's Jewish character. Trust in the Supreme Court has dropped. Calling someone leftist here has become a slur. And, you know, Israel also has had, really, a great 10 years. Unemployment is down. The economy's doing well. But society has changed, and people feel that society has been divided. GREENE: NPR's Daniel Estrin reporting for us ahead of this election in Israel. Daniel's in Jerusalem. Daniel, thank you. ESTRIN: Thank you, David. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) GREENE: OK. The United States is evacuating its troops from Libya. MARTIN: Right. They're doing so because there are fears of what could become a full-blown urban war in the capital city, Tripoli. They've already been - there have already been clashes between rival militias on the outskirts of Tripoli. A renegade military general is leading a rebel force that's trying to take over the capital. The U.N.-backed government in Tripoli has said that it's prepared to fight back. GREENE: All right. Sudarsan Raghavan is the Washington Post's Cairo bureau chief and has been reporting on this tense moment in Libya. Sudarsan, welcome. SUDARSAN RAGHAVAN: Good to be with you, David. GREENE: So we should say, I mean, Libya has just been in - I mean, it's been unstable. It's been violent. It's been in chaos since Moammar Gadhafi was deposed, like, back in 2011. So explain why this situation is important and stands out. RAGHAVAN: That's a very good question. Unlike 2014, the last time Khalifa Haftar - the renegade general you just mentioned - clashed intensively with militias in Tripoli, he now has stronger backing of portions of the international community, including France, the UAE, Egypt and Russia. And even though all these powers are now urging him to halt his offensive on Tripoli or show restraint, the fact is they supported and fueled his ambitions, gave him political legitimacy. There's also much greater frustration among Libyans. Their economic woes have deepened since 2011, and they really want a solution. And with the U.N.-installed international crisis government, the international community now has more of a vested interest in Libya's success. And the U.N., as of now, as of this weekend, they're trying to reconcile the warring sides like no other time since 2011, trying to organize long-delayed elections. And these clashes now threaten to torpedo this reconciliation conference that is still, by the way, scheduled for this weekend. GREENE: I mean, it sounds like things are particularly bad if we're hearing the United States pulling its forces out. They were there for peacekeeping purposes, right? I mean, what exactly led to this decision by the United States? RAGHAVAN: Well, they were there now just for security purposes, but also to - for counterterrorism. You know, you still have a strong Islamic State presence around Libya. But the stated reason by the U.S. is - to leave, to evacuate - is that the security situation is worsening. But, you know, there's also concern that U.S. forces could possibly get entangled in the clashes. The U.S. backs the Tripoli government, but it also has opened lines of communication with Haftar. So they want to remain neutral. And really, the best way of doing that, at this moment, is to not be in Libya. GREENE: And what is the current state of things in and around Tripoli right now? I mean, is - have these clashes gotten to a point where civilians are being threatened? Are they evacuating the city? RAGHAVAN: Well, the picture is mixed. I mean, some residents we have contracted in Tripoli said they have fled their houses. Others are stockpiling food and staying inside their homes - always checking, you know, every hour for new information on the conflict, on how close it's to reaching their neighborhoods, via Facebook or cellphones. But for residents in some areas by the coast that we spoke to, where the war has not yet reached, life is still normal. You know, there's traffic in the streets, and people are going to work. The - you know, the residents of Tripoli are accustomed to southern eruptions of militia violence. GREENE: But this is a country that could be, I mean, dangerous for the world if it literally falls into total chaos. RAGHAVAN: Absolutely. I mean, what you could see if it falls into total chaos is possibly, you know, the resurrection of the Islamic State - which once, by the way, had its own self-described caliphate in the city of Sirte. And also, you know, it could lead to more illegal migration. The Europeans are concerned about that from Libya, as well as its neighbors. So it can definitely affect the region and the world - any more chaos, that is. GREENE: Sudarsan Raghavan is the Washington Post's Cairo bureau chief talking to us about the situation in Libya. Thanks for your time this morning. RAGHAVAN: My pleasure. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) Copyright \u00a9 2019 NPR.  All rights reserved.

            "article_content": "Two weeks of public impeachment hearings are over. Criminal charges against Israel's prime minister are announced. And, the Trump administration is deporting U.S. asylum-seekers to Guatemala.  STEVE INSKEEP, HOST: Many hours of public impeachment hearings left little dispute about the facts. DAVID GREENE, HOST: What remains are disputes over what the facts mean and also what to do. Witnesses rarely differed on the big picture here. President Trump asked for investigations of Democrats in Ukraine. His July 25 phone call asking for them was part of an effort involving numerous calls and officials. He also withheld meetings and military aid until those acts were revealed. The country heard from current and former administration officials, including these four. (SOUNDBITE OF HEARING MONTAGE) ALEXANDER VINDMAN: My worst fear of how our Ukraine policy could play out was playing out. FIONA HILL: He was being involved in a domestic political errand, and we were being involved in national security foreign policy. And those two things have just diverged. DAVID HOLMES: Of course, the president is pressing for a Biden investigation before he'll do these things the Ukrainians want. There is nodding agreement. GORDON SONDLAND: Again, everyone was in the loop. GREENE: The voices there of Lt. Col. Alexander Vindman, an active duty military officer; Fiona Hill, a Russia expert who had served in the Trump White House; also David Holmes, a midcareer U.S. diplomat; and Gordon Sondland, an ambassador who gave a million dollars to the Trump inauguration. INSKEEP: NPR reporter Tim Mak covers national security and politics, and he's here in our studios. Tim, good morning. TIM MAK, BYLINE: Good morning. INSKEEP: What was it like watching the witnesses on what may have been the final day, particularly the Russia expert, Fiona Hill? MAK: Well, she was the sort of person who exuded competence. She said she had been frustrated with Sondland for not working with her on Ukraine issues. That was part of her portfolio. But she later realized that they were working on different lanes. She said Sondland was working on a domestic political errand - you heard that clip earlier - and that he was asking for politically motivated investigations while she was working on national security. And that's why they deferred. INSKEEP: So a devastating phrase there. And beside her as she testified was David Holmes, this guy who was working in the U.S. Embassy in Ukraine. MAK: Right. It's become perhaps the second-most famous call of this whole saga. He overheard Sondland talking to the president by phone on July 26 and specifically heard the president asking about the investigations he wanted. We didn't hear anything in testimony yesterday that challenges that fact. INSKEEP: And we should note that was, as you said, one of two calls where the president is known to have talked about investigations, the other one asking for them from Ukraine's president. And there's a White House record of that. So what do lawmakers do now? MAK: So Democrats need to decide whether they are done calling witnesses. Take a listen to House Speaker Nancy Pelosi. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) NANCY PELOSI: We haven't made any decision. And as I said to the president, if you have any information that is exculpatory, please bring it forward because it seems that the facts are uncontested as to what happened. Now, if you have reason to convince people that something was different under oath, please let us know. MAK: It's not hard to imagine that there are other folks that Democrats would ideally like to hear from, like, you know, acting White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney or Rudy Giuliani, for example. INSKEEP: Where are Republicans on this? MAK: Well, they've said that there was no conduct because the money was eventually released. House Republican Leader Kevin McCarthy subscribes to that line of thinking. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) KEVIN MCCARTHY: I don't know how many more people they want to try to bring forward. But every time they do, it goes right back to the case that the president did not make conditions. The president released the money. And Ukraine did nothing for the money to be released. MAK: It's worth noting, however, that the money was released only after a whistleblower complaint began circulating and the House announced its intent to investigate. INSKEEP: So if this is the last hearing - we're not absolutely sure - where's the process go from here? MAK: Well, if they're finished with hearing from witnesses, they will need to write a report and provide it to the House Judiciary Committee to consider potential articles of impeachment against the president. It certainly sounds like the House Intelligence Committee is - was making closing arguments yesterday as they wrapped up. INSKEEP: Including one from Adam Schiff, the committee chairman, who said, the country is better than that. Tim, thanks so much - really appreciate it. MAK: Thanks a lot. INSKEEP: That's NPR's Tim Mak. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) INSKEEP: The president's closest ally abroad is also accused of abusing his power. GREENE: Right. Israel's attorney general announced the indictment of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. The charges came after a three-year investigation. He's accused of illegal dealings with businessmen and media moguls. The charges come after not one but two inconclusive elections this year. And his political - as well as legal - future is right now pretty uncertain. INSKEEP: NPR's Daniel Estrin is in Tel Aviv. Hey there, Daniel. DANIEL ESTRIN, BYLINE: Hi, Steve. INSKEEP: Now, what, according to the indictment anyway, did the prime minister do? ESTRIN: Well, he's facing charges of fraud, breach of trust. The most serious charge, though, is bribery. And that could carry a jail sentence of seven to 10 years. And the bribery allegation is that he and his family got to dictate glowing coverage of themselves on a news website - This happened, allegedly, hundreds of times - and that, in return, he helped the owner of that news site - he's a telecoms executive - by making regulatory decisions that netted a lot of money for the telecoms executive. INSKEEP: Wow. ESTRIN: And Netanyahu is also accused of some other things - of talking to another media mogul about trading positive press for help with his business and for doing favors for a Hollywood mogul - for the producer of \"Pretty Woman\" - and getting a stream of cigars and champagne in return. INSKEEP: Wow. So a variety of charges there. How is the prime minister responding? ESTRIN: Well, he went on TV last night right after the attorney general announced these charges. The attorney general called them grave - and that he's confident that they're likely to result in a conviction. But Netanyahu called it a coup. Here's what he said. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) PRIME MINISTER BENJAMIN NETANYAHU: (Foreign language spoken). ESTRIN: He said this is an attempted toppling of the prime minister. And he said the investigation into him was tainted. And he ended his speech with this. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) NETANYAHU: (Foreign language spoken). ESTRIN: \"We need to finally, once after all, investigate the investigators.\" That's the same line, of course, that President Trump said about his administration's investigation into the Russia investigation. So this is Netanyahu's scorched-earth approach. He's not leaving office. He is, according to many observers here, delegitimizing the investigation into him and deepening public mistrust in the justice system to shore up his own base. INSKEEP: You said not leaving office. This is a guy who's been through two elections this year, hasn't quite gotten enough votes that he can form a government. Can an indicted prime minister stay in office under those circumstances? ESTRIN: That's exactly the question because there may be third elections coming up. And so there's going to be a question - what happens when Israel's in a transitional government, and there are new elections? Can he run for reelection? There's no law forcing him out of office. There's going to be a lot of questions whether his own political allies will still stay by his side. INSKEEP: Daniel, thanks so much. ESTRIN: You're welcome. INSKEEP: That's NPR's Daniel Estrin. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) INSKEEP: The United States is now deporting some asylum-seekers to Guatemala. GREENE: That's right. Yesterday, the U.S. sent a Honduran migrant to Guatemala after he had arrived in El Paso, Texas. He is the first asylum-seeker to be flown to Guatemala under terms of a deal President Trump's administration approved in July. And we should say this marks a major change in U.S. asylum rules. INSKEEP: Which reporter Maria Martin is covering from Guatemala. Welcome to the program. MARIA MARTIN: Thank you so much. INSKEEP: I know immigration law is always complicated, but we can follow it through the story of this one specific person, the very first person to face this new policy. Who is he? MARTIN: He's a young Honduran named Erwin Ardon who arrived from El Paso, Texas, where he'd applied for political asylum. He was flown, basically, alone on this very large plane, which normally bring back over 100 deportees to Guatemala City on Thursday morning. And Guatemala's interior minister says that more flights with asylum-seekers will arrive in the coming week. INSKEEP: So he's a Honduran. He's fleeing the Central American country where there's been a lot of violence. He said he wanted political asylum, and they flew him to Guatemala. What would normally have happened to him when he reached the U.S. under the old rules? MARTIN: Well, he'd probably be detained in the U.S. or released in the U.S. until his case would be heard. People from Central America could come to the border and apply for asylum there. Or they could apply in a safe third country, which, until now, was only Canada. And if they came to the U.S. border, they usually would be allowed to stay while awaiting an asylum hearing. But under the new accord, Ardon and others will be sent back to Guatemala. INSKEEP: OK. How are people responding, then, where you are in Guatemala, the destination of this man and other - apparently other asylum-seekers? MARTIN: Yes. Well, this agreement has been widely unpopular in Guatemala among human rights groups, among civil society and everyday people. They ask, how can Guatemala be considered safe when thousands of Guatemalans are fleeing its high rates of violence and poverty each year and when the country can't even take care of its own people? The well-known migrant advocate and Catholic priest Mauro Verzeletti is among the Guatemalans who believe that Guatemala's government was pressured to accept the agreement. MAURO VERZELETTI: (Foreign language spoken). MARTIN: \"It was imposed on us,\" says Verzeletti, \"placed before us like a sword and a cross for Guatemala to sign, under the threat of economic sanctions.\" INSKEEP: Interesting point you make that Guatemala is supposed to be a country of refuge but has its own people fleeing their own stories of violence and heading toward the United States. Still, they're getting this first asylum-seeker. What's going to happen to him? MARTIN: Well, that was a big question about him and about additional asylum-seekers sent back. Guatemala's minister of the interior, Enrique Degenhardt, has said that there are three options for returned people like him - Hondurans, Salvadorans. One is to be sent back - or to be sent to the jungle province of Peten - that's a remote and - hello? INSKEEP: No, I'm still here. Keep going. MARTIN: ...Of Peten - that's a remote and underdeveloped area and ripe with drug trafficking. Two, they could be sent back to Honduras or El Salvador. Or three, they could stay in Guatemala on their own under a Central American migration pact that allows free travel in the region. Ardon himself, this young man, has elected to go back to Honduras under a newly announced program of the international migration agency. And another question is, what will happen to the accord under the new president who takes office in January? INSKEEP: OK. So started in Honduras, fled all the way to the United States, ended up back in Honduras. Maria Martin, thanks so much. MARTIN: Thank you.

For several nights this month, searchlights have been illuminating the sky on the U.S.-Mexico border between El Paso, Texas, and Ciudad Ju\u00e1rez, Mexico. They don't have anything to do with stepped-up border enforcement. Instead, they're part of a binational art installation that aims to connect people on both sides of the Rio Grande. The large-scale interactive installation is called Border Tuner. Here's how it works: You step up to a microphone and turn a small wheel that controls a set of searchlights. Someone at another station just across the border does the same. When your lights intersect in the sky, it opens a two-way channel of communication. You can't see each other's faces, but you can hear each other's voices, booming from a loudspeaker. And you can start a conversation. On a chilly night this week, Edna Leon leaned into a microphone at one of the stations outside Bowie High School, where there are three tuner stations. On the other side of the border in Ju\u00e1rez, Chamizal Park has three stations. \"Buenas noches,\" Leon said, tentatively, unsure who was on the other end. Three large searchlights flickered in time with her voice. A response came back over the loudspeaker: \"Buenas, buenas.\" Leon introduced herself. She explained that she lives in El Paso but is originally from Meoqui, in the Mexican state of Chihuahua. \"I have roots there, but it's a struggle to be able to go\" and visit, she said in Spanish. \"So it makes me emotional to be able to communicate with my country without barriers, a passport, inspections.\" \"How beautiful,\" said her conversation partner. Border Tuner, which ends on Sunday, was two years in the making. It's the brainchild of electronic artist Rafael Lozano-Hemmer. He's originally from Mexico City and is now based in Montreal. Lozano-Hemmer has created interactive sound and light installations all over the world, including in Abu Dhabi and Dublin. He had been drawn to the U.S.-Mexico border for years, but his desire to work here intensified after President Trump's election. He began meeting with artists in the region. \"I realized that everybody in the field is tired of a very specific border story coming out about divisiveness, about racism, about militarization,\" he said. Surrounded by beams of lights, a man walks up to a microphone and tells the person across the border that he's new to El Paso. He moved here a few years ago from Ciudad Juarez, and says he misses it. The voice on the other side tells him to visit and they'll get tacos together.\n                \n                    \n                    Carlos Morales/Marfa Public Radio\n                    \n                \nhide caption Surrounded by beams of lights, a man walks up to a microphone and tells the person across the border that he's new to El Paso. He moved here a few years ago from Ciudad Juarez, and says he misses it. The voice on the other side tells him to visit and they'll get tacos together. \"While all of this is true, there's so many other narratives that are being missed about interdependence and coexistence and about the fact that connections between, at least, El Paso and Ciudad Ju\u00e1rez go deep historically, fraternally, socially, environmentally, economically,\" he said. Lozano-Hemmer designed a project to highlight those connections, in partnership with the Rubin Center for the Visual Arts at the University of Texas at El Paso and the El Paso Community Foundation. Pulling off a large-scale art installation across international lines was no easy feat. Lozano-Hemmer had to coordinate with authorities on both sides of the border, including the Department of Homeland Security and the Federal Aviation Administration. And when the U.S. government replaced a border fence between Bowie High School and Chamizal Park with new, stronger material, Lozano-Hemmer says he had to adapt his technology. Now, the searchlights form a sort of bridge above the barrier. \"The idea that the artwork takes place above that wall to me is symbolically important because it's almost like you're trying to ignore it,\" Lozano-Hemmer said. \"You're trying to say we still share the atmosphere.\" Each night of the installation begins with a 30-minute curated performance by local artists, activists, and historians. There have been programs focused on indigenous voices, and on voices from the LGBTQ community. There was a cumbia night, and a night full of cover bands paying tribute to Juan Gabriel and Selena. But the most intimate moments come when strangers connect. Two children discuss their favorite animals. An attorney who volunteers with asylum seekers and a middle school art teacher thank each other for their work. A woman in El Paso apologizes for President Trump; her conversation partner, in Ju\u00e1rez, tells her not to worry and that \"he's only one person.\" Two women discover they love to sing, and perform a song together, their voices harmonizing through beams of light. A young girl named Anabella celebrated her eighth birthday at Border Tuner. Small crowds on both sides of the border sang \"Happy Birthday\" in English and Spanish. \"It was really cool for my daughter to be able to experience something this magical on her birthday,\" said Anabella's mother, Tracy Harris. She said the installation has been a learning opportunity for her two children. \"It just kind of hits them like, 'Hey, there's other kids, there's other people over there, and they're like us.'\"",

            "article_content": "Sunday's elections in Guatemala are leaving voters with a choice between two unpopular candidates. It's emblematic of the conditions that are driving thousands of Guatemalans north.  SACHA PFEIFFER, HOST: Guatemalans go to the polls tomorrow to choose a new president. The election comes amid a migration crisis and increasing pressure from the Trump administration to keep Central Americans from heading to the U.S. Both candidates oppose an agreement with Trump that would force Guatemala to accept thousands of asylum-seekers, but they're finding a hard time connecting with the electorate. NPR's Carrie Kahn reports. CARRIE KAHN, BYLINE: That asylum agreement is highly unpopular here. Guatemala can't be a safe haven for Central America's migrants, warns candidate and former first lady Sandra Torres. We are the most unsafe country for malnutrition and poverty, she says. She wants to send more money directly to Guatemala's rural poor and fund more social programs. (SOUNDBITE OF TONO ROSARIO SONG, \u201cDALE VIEJA DALE\u201d) TONO ROSARIO: (Singing in Spanish). KAHN: At a recent late-night rally in the capital, her supporters, listening to music and watching fireworks, barely fill half of the island in the middle of a busy traffic circle. (SOUNDBITE OF FIREWORKS) KAHN: Jose Pablo Cruz (ph), a factory technician, says this election doesn't have the excitement like past ones. Voter turnout is predicted to be low. He's going for Torres. She would be Guatemala's first woman president. JOSE PABLO CRUZ: (Speaking Spanish). KAHN: \"She's someone who has helped, especially the poor people,\" he says. \"And we need that now more than ever,\" he adds. Nearly 60% of Guatemalans live in poverty. That and the high levels of violence, corruption and persistent droughts are pushing people out of the country in record numbers. Torres' opponent, conservative Alejandro Giammattei, says he'll stop the exodus with his own wall, riffing on President Trump's border barrier pledge. He says he'll build an economic wall of jobs to stem the migrant exodus. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) UNIDENTIFIED MUSICAL ARTIST: (Singing in Spanish). KAHN: At a recent rally, Giammattei's supporters tout his get-tough-on-crime credentials. He once ran the country's prison system. Jeffrey Enriquez (ph), 27, walks right through the rally on his way home from work. He works at a call center hunting down delinquent Sprint cellphone users. He doesn't think either candidate will make things better. He's looking for a way out, too. JEFFREY ENRIQUEZ: And I don't want my kids born and raised in a country that is really risk, violence. You're not asking me, but I just get robbed a couple of days ago. KAHN: He prefers Giammattei. Both candidates are unpopular, though, and have had unsuccessful runs at the presidency before. This is Giammattei's fourth time, all under different parties. His new Vamos Party is reportedly backed by the military. He's also spent time in jail for killings during his time as the prison head but was later exonerated. And Sandra Torres is not well-liked in the populist capital. She's making her third run for the office. She's facing charges of illicit campaign financing during her last presidential campaign. Her opponents paint her as a dangerous leftist because of her pledge to provide assistance to the poor. Both vehemently oppose abortion rights and gay marriage. DIONISIO GUTIERREZ: This election - it's another lost opportunity. KAHN: Dionisio Gutierrez is one of Guatemala's richest men. He left his family's fried chicken empire years ago to fund a civic foundation and has a weekly commentary show on TV. D GUTIERREZ: Guatemala is a country that has been governed by incompetence and corruption for so many years. I would say decades. KAHN: And the bad political choices now are another sign of Guatemala's fragile democracy, he says. And there are a dozen parties now in the Congress, many with suspect backing. Corruption is high on the list of voters' concerns. The current president dismantled a U.N.-backed anti-corruption commission soon after it began investigating him and his family. Both candidates say they will not renew the corruption commission's mandate that expires in September. And former foreign minister Edgar Gutierrez says neither will have much leverage when it comes to standing up to President Trump's migration demands. EDGAR GUTIERREZ: (Speaking Spanish). KAHN: \"Once they get into power,\" he says, \"they'll have to capitulate to the U.S., Guatemala's largest trading partner.\" Voter Jose Pablo Cruz says he just hopes either winner works hard. CRUZ: (Speaking Spanish). KAHN: \"And they better not trick us,\" he says. \"They made all these promises and better stick to them.\" Carrie Kahn, NPR News, Guatemala City.

Updated at 5:25 p.m. ET President Trump has announced an immigration proposal that would dramatically reshape the legal immigration system in the United States. The plan \"puts jobs, wages and safety of American workers first,\" Trump said in the White House Rose Garden on Thursday. \"We must implement an immigration system that will allow our citizens to prosper for generations to come,\" he said. The plan does not address the pressing challenge of what to do about the estimated 11 million people currently in the country illegally, one of the core issues that has animated Trump's presidency. The speech was notably softer in tone for a president who has often used harsh language when describing immigrants. Trump's son-in-law and senior adviser Jared Kushner has been quietly working on the plan for months and briefed Republican senators on the details Tuesday. A senior administration official, who spoke to reporters Wednesday on the condition that his name not be used, said the proposal is a \"good faith effort\" intended to unify Republicans and start a discussion. \"Right now this is the Trump plan, and we're hoping this will become the Republican plan,\" the official said. The plan would prioritize merit-based immigration, limiting the number of people who could get green cards by seeking asylum or based on family ties. But it would keep immigration levels static, neither increasing or decreasing the number of people allowed to legally enter the U.S. each year. Here are the elements of the proposal as described to reporters on Wednesday: Trump described the current immigration system as being largely based on \"random chance,\" insisting that the administration's proposal would set clearer requirements for admission. \"We want immigrants coming in; we cherish the open door,\" Trump said. \"But a big proportion of those immigrants should come in through merit and skill.\" The announcement comes as the Trump administration is struggling to deal with a dramatic increase in asylum seekers trying to enter the U.S. along the southern border, creating what many are now calling a humanitarian crisis. Earlier this year, President Trump declared a national emergency to go against the wishes of Congress and shift funds to build the border wall he promised during his presidential campaign. So White House aides see this as an ideal moment to try again to reshape the immigration system and enhance border security, something that requires congressional buy-in. Democrats are unlikely to support any immigration proposal that doesn't also address the young people who came to the U.S. as children and are now here illegally, known as Dreamers. President Trump moved to eliminate the Obama-era program to give them work permits and protection from deportation, and the program is now in limbo pending court action. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., said the White House proposal, \"repackaged the worst of its past failed immigration plans\" and described it as \"dead-on-arrival\" and \"not a remotely serious proposal.\" The last time Trump and his White House proposed an immigration overhaul, it included a path to citizenship for Dreamers. While potentially more detailed, this proposal is less comprehensive than previous offers by Trump and his administration. Asked about this omission, White House press secretary Sarah Sanders said Thursday, \"Because it's a serious program, it's not included. Every single time that we have put forward or anyone else has put forward any type of immigration plan and it's included DACA, it's failed. It's a divisive thing. Certainly something to discuss and look at and address but this plan is focused on fixing a different part of the immigration system.\" DACA has actually registered strong bipartisan support among voters. A 2018 Gallup poll found that 83% of Americans backed giving citizenship to DACA recipients. Senate Judiciary Chairman Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., a close ally of Trump's, said the proposal was purposely narrow by not addressing those in the country already. \"I don't think it's designed to get Democratic support as much as it is to unify the Republican Party around border security,\" Graham said, who characterized it more as a \"negotiating position\" than a legislative proposals. \"This is what we want on border security, this is what we want on merit-based immigration, and then we'll have to sit down and find common ground on the 11 million.\" Graham, who attended Thursday's announcement, was involved in the last major bipartisan effort to overhaul immigration in 2013. That legislation passed the Senate but failed in the House. Trump's proposal has zero chance of becoming law without bipartisan support. And at the moment it isn't clear whether it has Republican buy-in, much less Democrats. And the proposal is likely to run into trouble from the right, too, because it doesn't restrict legal immigration. \"This bill will only get worse. As a starting point it's not acceptable,\" said Mark Krikorian, executive director of the Center for Immigration Studies. Krikorian wants to see the level of legal immigration reduced and is concerned that the Trump proposal doesn't even start by calling for a cut in immigration. \"I don't think any of them really understands how important it is to his voters that there be some acknowledgement that numbers need to come down,\" said Krikorian. \"Is it an actual legislative vehicle or is it a campaign statement? And if it is real legislation why would they start with what is already a compromise position? The art of the deal says you start with an aggressive position. Why wouldn't this have cuts to legal immigration.\" While insisting that this is a serious proposal, the White House official also suggested that the Democrats running for president should be asked about the plan. It currently isn't in the form of legislation, and there are no lawmakers signed on as sponsors. But Trump called the plan \"pro-American, pro-immigrant and pro-worker. It's just common sense.\" \"If for some reason, possibly political, we can't get the Democrats to approve this merit-based, high-security plan, then we will get it approved immediately after the election when we take back the House, keep the Senate, and of course, hold the presidency,\" Trump said on Thursday. After a pause for applause, he added: \"But wouldn't it be nice to do it sooner than that?\" NPR's Mara Liasson, Susan Davis, Domenico Montanaro and Dana Farrington contributed reporting to this story.",

Updated at 4:14 p.m. ET President Trump is set to unveil an immigration plan that would vastly change who is allowed into the United States. Trump will present the plan in a speech from the White House Rose Garden Thursday afternoon. The new plan would focus on reducing family-based immigration to the U.S. in favor of employment-skill-based immigration. But overall, the number of green cards issued under this plan would not change, and there would be no reduction in net immigration. The bottom line politically, said the administration official: \"We want to show the country that Republicans are not against immigrants.\" Democrats have not been consulted on the formulation of this plan. And getting it to pass the Democratic-controlled House or the Senate, where Republicans do not have a filibuster-proof majority, are next to impossible. But with the president up for reelection next year, the White House is making a calculation to put this plan front and center. The plan, according to a senior administration official, addresses six issues: The formula currently for who comes to the country is 12% skill-based, 66% with ties to family members and 22% humanitarian, or asylum-seekers. Trump would change that calculation to 57% skill, 33% family, 10% humanitarian. To determine who is a highly skilled immigrant, people would be awarded points based on their education and their language proficiency. But the number of green cards would stay the same at approximately 1.1 million per year. Of the four pillars that the administration has always stressed \u2014 border security, citizenship, a guest-worker program and what to do with immigrants who have entered the country illegally, including DREAMers \u2014 the last two are not addressed. President Trump has taken a hard line toward immigrants entering the country illegally or seeking asylum. It's part of what vaulted him to the presidency and made his base loyal to him. One key question is what tone Trump strikes in his Thursday remarks. A more moderate tone may suggest that the White House is concerned about Trump's political standing as the 2020 election gets underway. But Trump is notoriously unpredictable and may go off-script.

WikiLeaks was already established as an online outlet for posting secret documents from anonymous leakers well before its massive disclosure of U.S. government and military information in 2010. That was the year WikiLeaks' Australian founder, Julian Assange, faced allegations that led to his seeking asylum in Ecuador's London embassy. Here is a timeline of WikiLeaks' key disclosures and related developments. November: WikiLeaks posts a U.S. Army manual of standard operating procedures for soldiers overseeing al-Qaida suspects held captive at Camp Delta in Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. September: Two months before the U.S. presidential election, WikiLeaks posts leaked emails from the Yahoo account of Republican vice presidential contender Sarah Palin. November: WikiLeaks posts more than half-a-million pager messages it claims were sent on Sept. 11, 2001. April: WikiLeaks posts a classified U.S. military video of a U.S. Apache helicopter gunship firing on what the military says were believed to be armed fighters in New Baghdad, Iraq. Among the 18 killed were two Reuters journalists. May: Pfc. Bradley (later known as Chelsea) Manning is arrested by the U.S. military and then court-martialed in June, charged with leaking the combat video posted on WikiLeaks as well as classified State Department documents by downloading those documents to a personal computer. July: WikiLeaks posts what it calls \"The Afghan War Logs,\" more than 75,000 classified documents that record previously undisclosed civilian casualties inflicted by the U.S. and coalition forces, details of the pursuit of Osama bin Laden and accounts of stepped-up fighting by the Taliban. August: WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange faces an arrest warrant over allegations of rape and molestation during a visit to Sweden; police question him in Stockholm, where he denies the allegations. October: WikiLeaks posts nearly 400,000 classified military documents it calls \"The Iraq War Logs\"; they detail the involvement of Iraqi security forces in the torture of prisoners of war, document higher civilian death tolls and describe Iran's support for Iraqi insurgents. November: WikiLeaks posts the first 250,000 of more than 3 million leaked U.S. diplomatic cables from nearly 300 American consulates and embassies worldwide that span the years from 1966 to 2010. December: Assange is arrested in London to face extradition for the Swedish allegations; he is released and put under house arrest after posting bail. February: WikiLeaks posts seven cables from the U.S. Embassy in Cairo, amid violent clashes between Egyptian security forces and pro-democracy demonstrators; the documents discuss Egypt's human rights and civil liberties violations. April: WikiLeaks posts \"The Guantanamo Files,\" some 800 classified military documents detailing the official allegations of terrorist actions by the men held captive in Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. October: After being removed from Amazon's servers and being allegedly cut off from major credit card companies as well as PayPal and Western Union, WikiLeaks suspends publication of leaked documents to \"aggressively fundraise.\" February: WikiLeaks starts posting a trove of what it claims are 5 million leaked emails from Stratfor, a private company that describes itself as a \"global intelligence company.\" June: Assange takes refuge in Ecuador's London embassy, where he seeks political asylum. July: WikiLeaks begins posting more than 2 million leaked emails, dating back to 2006, from 680 Syrian government officials and firms. August: Assange is granted political asylum at Ecuador's London embassy; a military judge condemns Manning to a 35-year prison sentence; Manning announces gender transition and asks to be known as Chelsea. Throughout the year: WikiLeaks posts leaked documents detailing the private negotiations for major trade deals, including the Trans-Pacific Partnership and the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership. June: WikiLeaks posts leaked documents from the Saudi foreign ministry. July: WikiLeaks begins posting leaked National Security Agency documents revealing American surveillance of German Chancellor Angela Merkel, French President Fran\u00e7ois Hollande, U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon, as well as two prime ministers, Israel's Benjamin Netanyahu and Italy's Silvio Berlusconi. July: WikiLeaks posts nearly 20,000 emails and 8,000 attachments from leaders of the Democratic National Committee; Assange later denies allegations that Russian intelligence services were the source of the leak. October: WikiLeaks posts more than 2,000 hacked emails from the account of John Podesta, who at the time was campaign chairman for Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton. January: Outgoing President Barack Obama commutes Manning's prison sentence, allowing her to be freed in May. March: WikiLeaks starts posting what it calls \"Vault 7,\" which it claims to be a collection of thousands of internal Central Intelligence Agency documents that detail a covert hacking program carried out by the agency as well as malware and software it uses to spy on smart TVs, the operating systems of most smartphones and Web browsers. September: WikiLeaks starts posting the first of what it says are 650,000 leaked critical documents from surveillance contractors working in a Russia ruled by President Vladimir Putin. October: CIA Director Mike Pompeo says the U.S. is \"working to take down\" WikiLeaks, which he calls \"an enormous threat.\" December: Assange is granted Ecuadorian citizenship. April: The Democratic National Committee files a lawsuit against WikiLeaks for its role in publishing the DNC's hacked emails. May: Manning's conviction under the Espionage Act is upheld by a U.S. Army Court of Criminal Appeals. November: A document written by a U.S. attorney inadvertently discloses that Assange has been charged under seal by the U.S. March: Manning is jailed after refusing to testify to a grand jury about what she leaked to WikiLeaks. April: Ecuadorian President Len\u00edn Moreno accuses WikiLeaks of intercepting his private phone calls and hacking photos of his bedroom, his meals and his wife and daughters dancing; Moreno provided no evidence, and WikiLeaks calls the charges \"bogus.\" Assange is arrested at Ecuador's London embassy by British police, accused of skipping bail. The U.S. Justice Department unseals an indictment of Assange dated March 6, 2018, that charges him with \"conspiracy to commit computer intrusion.\"",

A genetic bank of the unidentified is saving DNA samples from the remains for those searching for relatives. Jo-Marie Burt (@jomaburt) is a senior fellow at the Washington Office on Latin America and an associate professor of political science at George Mason University. Guatemala's ongoing political crisis is having a devastating impact on its people, fueling unrest in the streets and increasingly driving asylum-seekers to migrate to the U.S.-Mexico border. Now, with the country's Congress poised to pass a bill that would free war criminals, there's no clearer sign that rule of law in Guatemala is undergoing a slow, ugly collapse that could spur even more migration to the United States. The proposed legislation, which Guatemala's Congress is expected to debate imminently, would free more than 30 military officials convicted of crimes against humanity and more than a dozen others awaiting trial on such charges. It would also prohibit all future investigations into other cases of grave human rights crimes committed during the country's brutal 36-year civil war that ended in 1996. Should this amnesty bill pass, not only would it undo decades of work to provide justice to victims of wartime atrocities, it would represent an unequivocal return to the reign of impunity long sought by the powerful, military-backed networks of corruption that the United States has invested significant resources into dismantling. Guatemala's civil war and resulting genocide was fueled by U.S. Cold War support for regimes that, no matter how brutal against their own populations, were seen as protecting U.S. interests. United Nations investigators found that 200,000 people died, the vast majority at the hands of the Guatemalan army. Four out of every five victims were indigenous. Four hundred indigenous villages were wiped off the face of the earth. Impunity was the norm for many years, even after the conflict ended and peace accords were signed in 1996. But over the past 10 years, thanks to the persistent demands of victims and new generations of prosecutors and judges unencumbered by past fears, Guatemala has made impressive strides in bringing war criminals to justice. To date, Guatemalan courts have convicted 33 military officials, military commissioners and paramilitaries for a series of human rights violations, including enforced disappearances, massacres, torture, sexual violence and sexual slavery. Courts have also convicted one guerrilla leader for a 1988 massacre. Among those convicted are powerful men like Benedicto Lucas Garc\u00eda, former chief of the army general staff, trained at the infamous U.S. Army School of the Americas and the architect of Guatemala's bloody counterinsurgency policy. In May of last year, he was sentenced to 58 years in prison for crimes against humanity and the aggravated sexual assault of political activist Emma Molina Theissen, as well as the enforced disappearance of her 14-year-old brother. Guatemala's Congress is now poised to reverse all of this progress. Last month, lawmakers approved moving to vote on proposed legislation that would free all those convicted or awaiting trial for human rights violations within 24 hours of its promulgation. It would also ban all future prosecutions related to wartime atrocities. Signing the amnesty bill into law would have a grievous and widespread impact. It would further decimate the little trust that surveys show Guatemalans place in their state institutions. It would re-traumatize victims. It could put the lawyers, judges and families who have made the fight for accountability their life's work at risk of retaliation, as recently expressed by United Nations human rights commissioner Michelle Bachelet. What's especially concerning is that this push to let war criminals walk free is happening amidst a broader effort to make impunity the norm for elites, as corrupt officials seek to kick out an international anti-corruption body and restore their unfettered power and privilege over Guatemalan society. This all-out assault against the rule of law in Guatemala is being spearheaded by President Jimmy Morales, who came to power in 2015 after massive anti-corruption protests brought down the sitting president, vice president and dozens of other government officials. Morales' campaign slogan seemed primed for the moment: \"I am neither corrupt nor a thief.\" Yet when U.N.-backed anti-corruption body the International Commission Against Impunity in Guatemala, known by its Spanish initials CICIG, and the Attorney General's Office sought to investigate Morales and his party, the National Convergence Front, for illicit campaign contributions, Morales launched an offensive against the commission. Last August, surrounded by dozens of military officials, Morales announced that he was not renewing the CICIG's mandate, which was set to expire in September 2019, and barred its chief, Iv\u00e1n Vel\u00e1squez, from returning to the country. In January, he announced he was shuttering the CICIG's doors entirely. He has repeatedly defied court orders to allow the commission to continue its work through the end of its mandate, pushing Guatemala to the brink of a constitutional crisis. Morales has a personal dog in this fight. He has avoided impeachment charges over the alleged campaign finance crimes so far, but these violations have also brought election authorities close to dismantling the party that brought him to the presidency. Investigators have also brought charges against his brother and his son for corruption. But the assault on the CICIG transcends President Morales. It involves the very corrupt structures, rooted in the military old guard, that the CICIG was created to eradicate in the first place, and that stand to benefit significantly should Congress pass the amnesty law. In fact, Morales' victory in 2015 was the result of an alliance with powerful ex-military officials, business elites and evangelists. Investigations by the CICIG and the Attorney General's Office into representatives from these different special interest groups has spurred the campaign to rid the country of the CICIG and undercut the autonomy of key democratic institutions, including the Attorney General's Office and the courts. Many of the former military officials close to President Morales have been implicated in or face trial for conflict-era human rights violations. One example is Edgar Justino Ovalle Maldonado. One of several ex-military officials who founded the National Convergence Front in 2008, Ovalle recruited Morales to be its presidential candidate in 2015. As head of the party, Ovalle was elected to Congress in 2015 and wielded tremendous power as Morales' closest adviser. That shielded him from prosecution when investigators sought his arrest in January 2016 on charges of crimes against humanity, in relation to the enforced disappearance of at least 565 victims at the height of Guatemala's civil conflict. It is one of the largest cases of enforced disappearance in Latin America. However, after Ovalle's immunity was lifted in late 2017, he went into hiding and remains a fugitive. Other former retired military officials charged in that disappearances case have also either fled Guatemala or are still awaiting trial in the country. If the amnesty law passes, investigators would have to drop all their cases. Approval of the amnesty bill would put Guatemala in violation of international law, which prohibits amnesties, statutes of limitations or other mechanisms designed to protect human rights violators from prosecution. It would also undermine a decade of progress in reckoning with a violent past and building Guatemalans' faith in democratic institutions like the Attorney General's Office and the courts, which are the foundation of the rule of law and democratic governance. The U.S. government has strongly supported criminal prosecutions of war crimes in Guatemala. U.S. Congress members and the State Department should tell Guatemala in no uncertain terms that they must not grant amnesty for war criminals. Doing so paves the way for a new reign of impunity, one that will imperil the peace, hobble rule of law and exacerbate migration.",

            "article_content": "Austria's most prominent anti-immigrant conservative looks poised to return to power despite a cash-for-contracts scandal involving his far-right ally that brought down the government last spring.  SCOTT SIMON, HOST: Austria holds elections tomorrow. Voters will select new leaders four months after a scandal brought down the government - a coalition between anti-immigrant conservatives and the far-right. Joanna Kakissis reports from Vienna that despite the scandal, the two parties could govern together again. JOANNA KAKISSIS, BYLINE: Everyone expects that the Conservative People's Party will come in first in Sunday's elections and that its popular leader Sebastian Kurz will return as Austria's chancellor. REINHARD HEINISCH: He's handsome, he's rhetorically gifted, he's young and, to a lot of the Conservatives, represents the future. KAKISSIS: Reinhard Heinisch is a comparative politics professor at the University of Salzburg. HEINISCH: By moving his party to the right, he was able to steal votes away from the far-right. But nonetheless, he's in part responsible for legitimizing and mainstreaming the far-right by forming a government with the Freedom Party. KAKISSIS: And everyone is wondering if Kurz will team up with the party again, since the Conservatives likely won't get enough votes to govern alone. The 33-year-old Kurz's run as the world's youngest chancellor ended abruptly last May... (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) HEINZ-CHRISTIAN STRACHE: (Speaking foreign language) KAKISSIS: ..After media published a sting video of his vice chancellor, the former Freedom Party leader, Heinz-Christian Strache, on the Spanish island of Ibiza. Strache appeared with a woman posing as a rich Russian close to the Kremlin. He offered her government contracts if she supported his party. Strache stepped down, and the government collapsed. But the scandal didn't ruin the Freedom Party. At a mall in suburban Vienna, health care worker Brigitta Berger interrupts her errands to explain why. BRIGITTA BERGER: (Through interpreter) At least the Freedom Party keeps migrants out of Austria, so there's more social welfare benefits for Austrians. This party puts Austrians first. KAKISSIS: The party polished this message in 2015, when nearly a million migrants entered Europe. And Sebastian Kurz tried to co-opt the hardline rhetoric, says investigative reporter Nina Horaczek, who co-wrote a biography of Kurz. NINA HORACZEK: (Through interpreter) He wanted to win over right wing voters by repeating the Freedom Party's strict anti-immigrant rhetoric in a nicer tone, so he normalized it. KAKISSIS: So strong that Kurz invited the Freedom Party into his government in 2017. And then the rhetoric became action. The dorms housing migrants, for instance, were named departure centers. In the town of Traiskirchen, just outside Vienna, Afghan asylum seeker Daoud Saidi got the message. DAOUD SAIDI: (Through interpreter) I'm not wanted here. I told the Austrian authorities that the Taliban took over my village and that it's not safe. But they told me I had to leave Austria. KAKISSIS: The departure center signs are now gone. And migration is not the top issue in this election, but the Freedom Party is still using it as leverage. HEINISCH: On the issues of immigration, the Freedom Party had posters saying, wow, Mr. Kurz is learning from us. KAKISSIS: Again, politics professor Reinhard Heinisch. HEINISCH: The slogan that the Freedom Party is posting is, we need to be strong so we can keep the conservatives on the right path. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) KAKISSIS: And for the Freedom Party, that means reconciling with Kurz. There is even a campaign commercial showing the new Freedom Party leader Norbert Hofer in couples therapy with an actor portraying Kurz. (SOUNDBITE OF COMMERCIAL) NORBERT HOFER: (Speaking Foreign Language) KAKISSIS: We've got so much in common, Hofer says. We just need a little push to get back together.

            "article_content": "NPR's national political correspondent Mara Liasson gives us analysis of the news around the resignation of Kirstjen Nielsen from the Department of Homeland Security.  MICHEL MARTIN, HOST: We're going to continue the conversation with NPR national political correspondent Mara Liasson. Mara, Thanks so much for joining us. MARA LIASSON, BYLINE: Happy to be here. MARTIN: What does this mean? LIASSON: I think it means that the president, who had been frustrated with Secretary Nielsen and is frustrated with the surge of asylum-seekers at the border, just decided to make a change. And he did this the other day, where he took down his nominee for ICE, the Immigration and Customs Enforcement, said we're going in a tougher direction. And he had, we know, complained in the past that Nielsen hadn't been tough enough. And maybe he has something in mind where he will have a, quote, \"tougher\"-looking policy towards the border with tougher-looking people. MARTIN: As - sort of following this story in real time, and you can see the anonymous sources offering different messages to different networks, as they are want to do, some suggesting that she resigned because she was frustrated, others suggesting that she was fired because the president was frustrated. Do you have any insight about which of those versions is true? LIASSON: I think she was frustrated, and I think she was asked to resign. I think that she was widely kind of on thin ice for so long. I think that the story really is that how long she lasted, not so much that he decided to fire her. Many people expected her to be removed from the Cabinet right after the midterm elections. That didn't happen. It seemed that she was on firmer ground with the president. She made many trips to the border. She certainly delivered his message about the border. But he's unhappy. He's unhappy not just with the fact that there's been a surge of migrant families at the border, but also all of the things that he's tried to do haven't worked out. Remember, just this week, he said he was going to close the border. Then he backed down from that. He's talked about putting tariffs on Mexico if they don't stop immigration and drugs, but he can't do that because of the new USMCA, the new renegotiated NAFTA agreement that he signed. So the president's frustrated about the border, and he wants new people. MARTIN: So the president said on Twitter that the new person will be the current - at least the acting person will be the current Customs and Border Protection commissioner, Kevin McAleenan. What do we know about him? And do we expect that he might have a better relationship with President Trump than Kirstjen Nielsen seemed to have, since, as you pointed out, she seemed to struggle mightily and certainly in her utterances absolutely reaffirmed his policy and projected his point of view on these issues. LIASSON: Well, my - I don't think that Kevin McAleenan is going to be the permanent Homeland Security secretary. There are other names that we've heard, including Rick Perry, who's currently the energy secretary. But the president has a very large number of acting secretaries right now. He's actually said he likes having people who are acting. It gives him more flexibility. And especially on the border, where he feels so strongly. This is such a top issue for him - immigration, stopping immigration, the kind of fear of immigrants coming over the border to do harm to Americans, which is a constant theme of his, is something that will be a centerpiece of his re-election campaign. And I think that, more than anything else, you'll see him driving policy on the border, not necessarily whoever takes over from Kirstjen Nielsen. MARTIN: Mara, we only have a couple of seconds left, but you've also pointed out that many of the - the president has been frustrated, in part, by the law. Is there any strategy that he's employing to try to address the fact that legal issues have kept him from implementing the policies that he prefers? LIASSON: Well, he's tried several things, and they haven't worked out. He talked about closing the border. He's talked about, you know, superseding the USMCA with tariffs - a punishment, in other words, on Mexico. But the one thing that he has succeeded in doing is making the border, and what he calls the crisis at the border, front and center in the media narrative. And that is the way that he succeeded. He thinks this is a very important issue for him and his base in the next election. MARTIN: That is NPR national political correspondent Mara Liasson. Mara, thank you so much. LIASSON: Thank you.

            "article_content": "As President Trump prepares to receive Viktor Orban at the White House, we look at the Hungarian prime minister's so-called illiberal democracy.  MICHEL MARTIN, HOST: Tomorrow President Trump will receive Hungary's prime minister Viktor Orban in the Oval Office. It's the first visit by a Hungarian prime minister to the White House since 2005. The Obama administration limited diplomatic contacts with Orban's government over concerns that it was eroding democratic norms. Joanna Kakissis was recently in Hungary and has this profile. JOANNA KAKISSIS, BYLINE: Viktor Orban was once a hero of democracy. As a young anti-Soviet activist, he founded a political movement that helped transition his country out of communism. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) BILL CLINTON: Prime minister, I'm glad to have you here. KAKISSIS: In 1998, when he was just 35, he was already prime minister and visiting Bill Clinton's White House. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) PRIME MINISTER VIKTOR ORBAN: I'm very happy to be here as prime minister, as future member of NATO. KAKISSIS: Four years later, his party lost elections, and he was out of power. When he became prime minister again in 2010, he was a changed man. Political analyst Gabor Gyori noticed ruthlessness. GABOR GYORI: Viktor Orban is famous for his view that politics is war. This is destroy or be destroyed. KAKISSIS: Under Orban, Hungary rewrote its constitution to strengthen his control over Parliament. With Parliament, he's weakened the courts. And Orban supporters have taken control of most of the media. KIM LANE SCHEPPELE: Also, he's been able to challenge the European Union, the most powerful regional organization in the world. KAKISSIS: Kim Lane Scheppele is a professor at Princeton University and an expert on Hungary. SCHEPPELE: He's a member of all the most exclusive clubs, right? He's in NATO. He's in the EU. And he stands for this, kind of, right wing nationalism. Once you're successful, then other autocrats want to say, how do you do it? KAKISSIS: Orban, who's a lawyer, did it by getting laws passed to consolidate his power. (APPLAUSE) KAKISSIS: He told supporters in 2014 that he wants to remake Hungary into what he calls an ill-liberal democracy. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) ORBAN: (Speaking Hungarian). KAKISSIS: He said his vision would balance individual freedom with the interests of the nation. (SOUNDBITE OF PROTEST) KAKISSIS: When hundreds of thousands of asylum-seekers from the Middle East and elsewhere tried to cross through Hungary in 2015, Orban portrayed them as invaders. He told reporters in Brussels that Europeans were full of fear. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) ORBAN: They are not satisfied at all what we European leaders are doing up to now. And the reason why they are criticizing us is that we are not simply defend the European borders. KAKISSIS: To defend his country's border, Orban built a razor-wire fence. It was a popular move. (SOUNDBITE OF BIRDS CHIRPING) KAKISSIS: In the southern city of Pecs, retired dental technician Kosmar Szabo (ph) points to an Ottoman era mosque in the city square. KOSMAR SZABO: (Through interpreter) At the end of the day, this is about history. Orban understands that we are a country that was once occupied for 150 years by the Turks. We know what that means. KAKISSIS: Migration to the EU is now at its lowest level in five years, but Orban claims a new enemy is trying to flood Europe with migrants again - George Soros, the Hungarian American billionaire. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) UNIDENTIFIED PERSON: (Speaking Hungarian). KAKISSIS: This message is blared on ads across the country. Orban surrogates claim Soros is using Central European University, which he founded, to wage a culture war on Hungary. They're forcing the campus out of the country. Balazs Hidveghi, the spokesman for Orban's Fidesz Party, elaborates. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) BALAZS HIDVEGHI: We've seen how George Soros and his network of NGOs, civic groups and lobby organizations, how they have infiltrated the European institutions, how they wage a strong campaign, also, in order to help migration become a constant reality. KAKISSIS: These conspiracy theories about Soros, who is Jewish, have unnerved Hungarian Jews. Hungary's backsliding on democracy has unnerved the European Union. The EU has issued warnings to Hungary, but no serious punishment. And Viktor Orban remains a prominent figure on the world stage. For NPR News, I'm Joanna Kakissis. Copyright \u00a9 2019 NPR.

            "article_content": "After nearly starting a trade war with Mexico, President Trump has pulled back his threat of tariffs.  LULU GARCIA-NAVARRO, HOST: According to the Democrats, the president creates a crisis, the president gets everyone talking about that crisis, and then he declares victory over the crisis he created. And so it was again with the tussle with Mexico over tariffs and immigration. In an abrupt turnaround, President Trump did back off a plan to impose punishing tariffs on all Mexican goods, touting an agreement with Mexico to reduce the number of migrants coming over the border. On the Republican side, there is relief, as the tariffs were unpopular. Now the question. Will the measures actually reduce the flow of migrants into the U.S., as the president wants? NPR's national political correspondent Mara Liasson is here to tell us more. Good morning. MARA LIASSON, BYLINE: Hi, Lulu. GARCIA-NAVARRO: Hi, Mara. We heard for days that there was no agreement. Then suddenly, a deal was announced. What happened here? LIASSON: What happened was that Trump climbed down. He had created a crisis, as you said. He threatened tariffs, got a lot of pushback from the business community, from Republicans in Congress, from his own advisers in the White House who were worried about damaging the economy. And then he found a way out of the box he put himself in. As you said, we don't know yet if this declaration between Mexico and the U.S. will actually lead to the numbers of migrants coming down. There are no metrics to measure success in this agreement. But we do know that Mexico had made some of the concessions in this agreement already. Back in December, the former DHS Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen had announced that Mexico was going to allow more asylum-seekers to stay in Mexico while they wait for their U.S. court date. That's just reaffirmed in this agreement. Mexico also agreed to send 6,000 National Guard troops to the Guatemalan border. They didn't agree to a U.S. demand to force asylum-seekers to apply for asylum in Mexico instead - for asylum to stay in Mexico instead of the U.S. But one thing that could be significant, the U.S. and Mexico agreed to a goal of, quote, \"building a more prosperous and secure Central America to address the underlying causes of migration.\" That would be significant, but recently the Trump administration actually cut funding to Guatemala, El Salvador and Honduras - the opposite. GARCIA-NAVARRO: Yeah. And that's something that the president of Mexico has really been pushing. Not just enforcement, but trying to bolster these Central American countries. But, Mara, you know, what is the wider context here? Because the president has started battles with so many of the country's largest trading partners. LIASSON: Well, going forward I think the question is, in other negotiations, such as with China, do other countries, does China, conclude that Donald Trump is worried enough about the softening of the U.S. economy as he enters his reelection campaign that he can be forced to back off of tariff threats with minimal concessions - that he likes to create a crisis, whether it's the government shutdown, or a threat to completely close the border or putting tariffs on, and then he either accepts no results or minimal concessions and declares victory? If that's what other countries conclude, that that's his MO, they might think he can be manipulated. GARCIA-NAVARRO: All right. Speaking of reelection, let's look at the Democrats and their intramural party disputes. Former VP Joe Biden is coming to grips with the party as he works for the Democratic nomination. He made an about-face on the Hyde Amendment. Tell us what happened there. LIASSON: He made an awkward about-face after his campaign had said he was for the Hyde Amendment, which prohibits federal funds like Medicare and Medicaid from paying for abortions. Now Biden has moved to get more in line with the modern Democratic Party, which is very pro-choice. And we see that other candidates are attacking him for this. It sounds like we're at the point in the campaign where the other Democratic candidates understand they have to stop Biden. People think if he can make it through Iowa, he will be an unstoppable front-runner. The question is can he get in line with the modern Democratic Party without looking feckless and out of touch? And No. 2, if he ends up being the nominee, can he get there without having to move too far to the left in a way that would hurt him in a general election? GARCIA-NAVARRO: And just briefly, though, I mean, there is a left wing of the party. And we're seeing two candidates really fighting for who will occupy the progressive spot, right? LIASSON: That is one of the most interesting things to me, the primary within a primary. Bernie Sanders versus Elizabeth Warren. It's kind of the progressive primary, revolutionary Sanders versus reformer Warren. And this rivalry is getting more intense. As a matter of fact, on Wednesday, Bernie Sanders is going to deliver a major address, called, \"How Democratic Socialism Is The Only Way To Defeat Oligarchy And Authoritarianism.\" That's a mouthful. Sounds like an academic lecture. But he clearly is understanding he has to push back against Warren. GARCIA-NAVARRO: NPR national political correspondent Mara Liasson. Thank you. LIASSON: Thank you.

            "article_content": "Trump administration officials are backing off their criticism of Mexico about a surge of migrants coming from Central America. Now the president is taking aim at Congress.  ARI SHAPIRO, HOST: President Trump is sending mixed signals about his plans for the southern border. His administration is backing off its criticism of Mexico after blaming that country for failing to stop a surge of migrants coming from Central America through Mexico to the U.S. Now Trump's taking aim at Congress. He says if lawmakers do not eliminate what he calls loopholes at the border, then he will just close it, or at least large sections of it. The president's economic adviser Larry Kudlow speaking today says, interpret Trump's tweets this way. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) LARRY KUDLOW: It shows his seriousness and how committed he is to restoring, you know, some semblance of law and order down there and to genuinely protect America's borders and its security. SHAPIRO: NPR's Joel Rose covers immigration and joins us now. Hi, Joel. JOEL ROSE, BYLINE: Hi, Ari. SHAPIRO: This idea of shutting down the border has drawn intense opposition from businesses, economists, Republicans on the Hill. Right now, how likely does it seem that the president would actually do this? ROSE: Kudlow said this morning that there has been no decision on whether to close the border. But he did acknowledge that the administration is looking at ways to balance the need to secure the border with the need to keep trade flowing by keeping truck lanes at the ports of entry open, for example. Kudlow said that President Trump understands that the U.S. and Mexico economies are intertwined. He also says the administration is getting more help from Mexico and now wants to see additional help from Congress. SHAPIRO: Mexican officials have not said a lot about this. What kind of help do you think the Trump administration is talking about? ROSE: Larry Kudlow did not offer any details, but our colleagues at Here & Now talked to White House deputy assistant Adam Kennedy earlier today. And Kennedy pointed out that Mexico is allowing asylum seekers from Central America to stay in that country while they wait for their day in U.S. immigration court. And Kennedy also talked about Mexico setting up, quote, \"checkpoints.\" (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED BROADCAST) ADAM KENNEDY: I think the president has seen more action from Mexico. I think he's seen some good progress, and I think the president's keeping all of his options open. ROSE: But we should also note that NPR's John Burnett has been down at the border between Mexico and Guatemala all week. And John says he's seen no checkpoints, at least where he is, and no signs that the Mexican government is controlling the flow of migrants into the country whatsoever. SHAPIRO: And meanwhile, people continue to cross the border into the U.S. What is the Americans' plan to deal with the huge number of families that are arriving here? ROSE: Right. You know, the Homeland Security estimates that 100,000 migrants crossed the border in March, roughly. That would be the biggest month in more than a decade - the biggest monthly total in more than a decade. And in response, Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen canceled her meetings in Europe this week, headed back to the border. Last night, she appointed a new interagency head to coordinate the DHS response. And it is a massive undertaking to care for and process the surge of migrants. They're mostly families and children fleeing from violence and poverty in Central America. Many of them are tired and sick from the journey. And Kirstjen Nielsen, the Homeland Security secretary, is moving up to 2,000 Customs agents away from the ports of entry to help process these migrants. And that's already leading to longer wait times for cars and trucks and pedestrians trying to cross the border at those ports. In El Paso, Texas, today, commercial truck drivers saw a five-hour wait time. But Nielsen says she has no choice. SHAPIRO: So as we said, the Trump administration is pushing Congress to act. What are the chances that this Congress, which has tried and failed so many times to pass comprehensive immigration legislation, might do it in the next couple years before the next presidential election? ROSE: Democrats in Congress do not seem interested in negotiating with the White House. They sent a letter to the administration yesterday, saying the president has been acting in, quote, \"bad faith\" on immigration. They say the administration's own policies are making the situation worse, and they urged the administration to address the root causes of violence in Central America instead of cutting foreign aid, as he says - as the administration says it's done this week and to funnel more resources to the border to process migrants' claims more quickly. SHAPIRO: NPR's Joel Rose. Thanks a lot. ROSE: Hey, you're welcome. Copyright \u00a9 2019 NPR.  All rights reserved.

            "article_content": "The border remains open and the rate of migrant apprehensions isn't slowing. Chicago elects its first African-American female mayor. Democratic presidential candidates release fundraising details.  STEVE INSKEEP, HOST: What does the flow of migrants really look like at the U.S. southern border? DAVID GREENE, HOST: Well, we got a reminder in recent days that what U.S. officials call a crisis is a mixture of reality and also political stagecraft. Last week, President Trump threatened to close the border. That threat seized headlines, just like his previous threats to do the same thing. Once again, officials have now backed off that threat, at least for the moment. They say Mexico is stepping up to help with the influx of asylum applicants. But it is true that U.S. border officials are receiving large, large numbers of people. INSKEEP: Which you've been watching, David. So what have you been seeing? GREENE: Yeah. I mean, you know, Steve, we've been talking about the focal point was a bridge that runs from Juarez, Mexico, here into El Paso. Now the area under that bridge has been cleared. They've moved a lot of migrants to an area of tents nearby. But there were these images of families from Central America being held behind barbed wire there. And even though that area has been moved, no one is suggesting that the rate of border apprehensions - the numbers of people crossing - is going to slow down any time soon. INSKEEP: Well, what is driving those numbers? GREENE: Well, you know, you ask different people, you hear different people emphasize different things. U.S. officials say that smugglers in Central America are really active right now. I mean, they're marketing themselves to families in Honduras and El Salvador and Guatemala, saying that the U.S. border is, essentially, open to families who arrive with their own children. And that's really an important thing to know. If you bring your own child with you, you are generally being processed within a few days and set free into the United States with a court date scheduled. So word seems to be spreading about that. And, Steve, I'll also tell you - I spoke to our colleague John Burnett, who is reporting, as we speak, in Mexico, right near the border with Guatemala. He says there's been a lot of information spreading on social media suggesting to people that President Trump could close the border at any moment. The message being - if you're going to make this trip, now is the time to do it. INSKEEP: Oh, so the president's regular threats - that get headlines - to close the border may actually drive people to hurry up and make the journey. But when people get where you are - and end up under a bridge or in a detention center or out on the street - are they saying they made the right decision? GREENE: Well, I think they're grappling with that. I mean, we've been hearing from some asylum-seekers who just didn't seem to grasp how difficult the journey is, including after their crossing into the United States. We spoke to one man from Honduras. He - we're not going to give his name for security reasons. But it was at a church here in El Paso. He was with his two kids, a girl - 11 years old - a boy - 12. And he - his family had been held under that bridge for four days after an 18-day bus trip from Honduras. UNIDENTIFIED PERSON: (Through interpreter) I spent eight days - four days under the bridge and then they took me to jail. It was a very cold place. We were on the cold floor. If I knew we would be going through all this, I would have not come. Money is not everything in life, but we risk a lot for our children and for their future. INSKEEP: Are you hearing a lot of people saying they wish they hadn't made the journey? GREENE: I wouldn't say a lot. I mean, many families - they look exhausted but really relieved to be here and getting help from nonprofit groups and shelters. One Salvadoran mom we met - I mean, she made this extraordinary journey, walking some of the way through Mexico just in torn socks. She had a 5-month-old son who nearly died - I mean, fever, vomiting. Someone asked her, like, why would you do that? How dare you bring a baby through this experience? And she said the gang violence was so awful in El Salvador, she just had no choice. INSKEEP: OK. David, thanks for your reporting there. And let's move on now to some other news. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) INSKEEP: News about Lori Lightfoot, who was a relative unknown in Chicago politics. Until recently, she had never held elective office. And when she announced a campaign for mayor last year, she was in a crowded scrum of 14 candidates. GREENE: Yeah, but then last night, she made history. She secured victory in the nation's third-largest city. The former federal prosecutor who worked in police oversight is becoming the first black woman and openly gay person to win this office. And she spoke to her supporters after the results were announced. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) LORI LIGHTFOOT: You know, when we started this journey 11 months ago, nobody gave us much of a chance. We were up against powerful interests, a powerful machine and a powerful mayor. GREENE: The mayor Lightfoot is speaking of is, of course, Rahm Emanuel. His popularity suffered in his second and final term as he was grappling with the city's financial woes and also an increasingly volatile relationship between the police and the black community. INSKEEP: NPR's Cheryl Corley has been covering this story from Chicago. Cheryl, good morning. CHERYL CORLEY, BYLINE: Good morning. INSKEEP: How did this person emerge from that crowded field of 14 candidates? CORLEY: Well, Steve, it was just incredible. As you mentioned, Lori Lightfoot's never held political office. She has held a variety of positions in city government, though. And Rahm Emanuel actually appointed Lightfoot to head the Chicago Police Board, the independent agency that rules on disciplinary cases of police. And Lightfoot began this journey, in part, because of a 2014 fatal shooting of a black teenager - Laquan McDonald - by a white police officer. It spurred a lot of protests in Chicago, the ouster of a lot of city officials, and led to Lightfoot declaring a run for mayor. And she promised to get rid of city hall corruption and to help low-income and working-class people. And that kind of made an impact. She promised to make change. And when Mayor Emanuel decided not to seek a third term, lots of other people declared a run for mayor after that - as you mentioned, 14 people in all. And Lori Lightfoot was one of the top vote-getters, along with Toni Preckwinkle, who is the chairman of the Democratic Party here. And... INSKEEP: Well, let me just ask you, Cheryl Corley, if I can - how... CORLEY: Yeah. INSKEEP: ...Is it that the mayor-elect intends to address this closely followed relationship between the city and its police? CORLEY: Well, she was the chair of a police accountability task force, which really blasted the police department and led to a Department of Justice investigation. And during the campaign, she promised to adhere to a consent decree, which came out of the Department of Justice investigation - or which was, at least, spurred by it. And that calls for a detailed list of reforms. And Lori Lightfoot says it's going to take a lot. And that consent decree calls for more training for police. But she says there is another fact that must not be ignored when it comes to how officers act in particular neighborhoods... INSKEEP: Let's listen. CORLEY: ...Here's what she had to say. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) LIGHTFOOT: We also know that if - our police officers are culture illiterate, which stems from the fact that we are - live in one of the most segregated cities in the country. We recruit from those segregated neighborhoods. And we do not adequately, in my view deal, with the fact that race matters in policing. INSKEEP: Didn't she also talk about entrenched poverty as she was claiming victory last night? CORLEY: She did, indeed. And she talked about the differences about the - how the West Side and South Side of the city are treated differently than the downtown area. So she's going to have a lot of things that she wants to focus on as she comes into office. INSKEEP: Cheryl, thanks so much. CORLEY: You're welcome. INSKEEP: NPR's Cheryl Corley. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) INSKEEP: OK. It takes votes to win an election, but it takes money to compete for them. And this week, we have new fundraising details from high-profile Democrats. GREENE: That's right. These numbers are for the first quarter of the year. The Bernie Sanders campaign - Tuesday - announced that it raised more than $18 million from half a million donors. Kamala Harris raised 12 million. And South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg - largely unknown before his presidential campaign announcement - has taken in $7 million. INSKEEP: NPR national political correspondent Mara Liasson has been following the money primary. Hey there, Mara. MARA LIASSON, BYLINE: Hi there, Steve. INSKEEP: So we mentioned a couple of high-profile numbers there. What stands out to you? LIASSON: Well, all those numbers are pretty eye-popping - shows you the enthusiasm of the Democratic base. They're willing to open their wallets. But I would say Bernie Sanders, of all the declared candidates, is the frontrunner, not only in polling but now in fundraising - $18 million, half a million donors. That is a tremendous amount. Now, history tells us that Democratic frontrunners don't usually stay that way. But that's where he is today. INSKEEP: Well, I'm thinking about the different ways that people talk about fundraising and politics. You will say the person who raised the most is the frontrunner, in a way. Other candidates will say you don't need to raise the most, but you need to raise enough. How much does the money really matter? LIASSON: Well, money matters. Of course, he's raised the most, and he's at the top of the polls right now. INSKEEP: Yeah. LIASSON: But if you ask President Jeb Bush if a lot of money matters... INSKEEP: (Laughter). LIASSON: You'll find out that it doesn't really make the difference. But it's the signs of... INSKEEP: He raised a ton of money - we should remind people... LIASSON: Yes. INSKEEP: ...In 2016... LIASSON: Right. INSKEEP: ...And got nowhere. Right. LIASSON: It's a sign of grassroots support. It is very important. And it's not a guarantee that you're going to be the nominee, but it means you can scale-up your operations. And especially if you're raising money in small amounts, you can go back to those people again and again. INSKEEP: You know, there would be a time in presidential primaries where we would presume, looking from the outside, that it's bad for a party to have a fragmented field and a huge number of candidates. But are there Democrats who are looking at this as promising, to have so many people who are all strong and fundraising and clearly have a strong support base building up? LIASSON: Yes, absolutely. It's a sign, as I said, of overall Democratic enthusiasm. People are turning out for these events to see the candidate. They're willing to open their wallets. It shows you that the Democratic base is energized and willing to do more than just cast a vote. They're willing to give money and work. INSKEEP: How does that compare to President Trump's fundraising? LIASSON: Well, President Trump has raised a tremendous amount of money. He's the first president to raise money in his first two years. By the end of 2018, the Trump campaign had raised about $68 million. Two additional political action committees that function as joint fundraising committees with the Republican Party had raised an additional 100 million. So that is a tremendous amount of money - shows you the power of incumbents. It's one of the reasons why it's so hard to beat an incumbent president. In recent memory, only two have been defeated - Jimmy Carter and George H. W. Bush. INSKEEP: I'm also looking at this figure. The president has not only raised almost $68 million. It's said that he's spent well over $50 million already, in the early phases, promoting his re-election. LIASSON: Right. INSKEEP: Mara, thanks so much. LIASSON: Thank you. INSKEEP: That's NPR's Mara Liasson. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) Copyright \u00a9 2019 NPR.  All rights reserved.  Visit our website terms of use and permissions pages at www.npr.org for further information.

            "article_content": "Guatemala enters a new era after the victory of a conservative former prison official with no previous governing experience. His challenges include deep corruption, poverty, violence and migration.  MARY LOUISE KELLY, HOST: Guatemala's president elect is a 63-year-old conservative who once ran the country's prison system. And he ran three unsuccessful bids for the presidency before winning this time around. Now, as NPR's Carrie Kahn reports, he inherits a strained relationship with the United States over migration, plus deep corruption and violence at home. CARRIE KAHN, BYLINE: Alejandro Giammattei beat his rival, former first lady Sandra Torres, by nearly 16 points. But no one is calling his victory a mandate. That's because nearly 60% of eligible voters didn't even bother to go to the polls. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) UNIDENTIFIED PERSON: (Speaking Spanish). KAHN: At this downtown Guatemala City polling place, Hilda Flores, an IT university professor, like many voters, had a hard time picking a candidate. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) HILDA FLORES: Like, the less worse - is that correct to say in English? - the less evil. KAHN: She says she's sick of choosing between the lesser of two evils. Sunday's presidential contest had the lowest voter turnout in nearly two decades. Even Giammattei's victory party was underwhelming. Looking exhausted, the former surgeon's acceptance speech was quick. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) ALEJANDRO GIAMMATTEI: (Speaking Spanish). KAHN: \"You will not find a president distant from the people. You will find a president close to the people,\" Giammattei declared before departing. He took yesterday off to rest. While Giammattei has run four presidential campaigns, he's never held office. And he's going to have to catch on fast. Guatemala is facing huge challenges. Nearly 60% of the population lives in poverty, and because of that and increasing violence and unchecked corruption, hundreds of thousands of Guatemalans have headed north and been detained at the U.S. border in the past 10 months. Edmond Mulet, an unsuccessful presidential candidate this year, says the Guatemalan state is failing. And he says he knows what that looks like. In the mid-2000s, he headed the U.N. mission to Haiti, the poorest country in the hemisphere. EDMOND MULET: The efforts in order to fight corruption have been very much reduced and - which is of concern. KAHN: Just four years ago, Guatemala was actually an inspiration for the rest of the region, as it jailed a class of corrupt politicians, including the then-president, vice president and other high-profile targets. That crusading crackdown was led by a U.N.-backed anti-corruption commission known as CICIG for its initials in Spanish. However, last year, current President Jimmy Morales, who had come under investigation by the commission, canceled it and expelled its head. Claudia Escobar, a former Guatemalan judge, says Morales has once again opened Guatemala to criminals and corrupt officials. CLAUDIA ESCOBAR: I feel that Guatemala right now is a patient that is in intensive care, and CICIG was the help for this patient to be alive. And with CICIG gone, I think we really have a high risk of being a failed state. KAHN: President-elect Giammattei, backed by business and military interests, says he won't bring CICIG back. He says he will instead attack the root causes of corruption but provides few details. He also pledges to start his own national anti-corruption commission. It's unlikely he'll get pressure from the U.S. to make good on those promises. President Trump has abandoned years of bipartisan support for CICIG. He didn't protest the commission's expulsion. Trump's now more focused on an agreement he got Guatemala to sign, obligating the country to accept possibly tens of thousands of Central American asylum-seekers. In his congratulatory tweet to the new president-elect, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo says he's looking forward to combating irregular migration together. He didn't mention fighting corruption. Guatemalan constitutional lawyer Alexander Aizenstatd says U.S. policy is shortsighted. ALEXANDER AIZENSTATD: Which is regretful because in the long term, the fights against corruption and impunity is something that will certainly reduce illegal migration. KAHN: Lorena Monzon, an insurance saleswoman, says Sunday's election results leave her pessimistic about Guatemala's future. LORENA MONZON: (Speaking Spanish). KAHN: \"We're going to go back to the way we were before when the politicians just did whatever they wanted and lined their pockets with all our money.\" Carrie Kahn, NPR News, Guatemala City.

Day after day, you're seeing stories about the 2020 census on the front page and all over TV news, even though the once-a-decade head count is still months away. The president wants the census questionnaire to include: \"Is this person a citizen of the United States?\" He's willing to delay the count \"for as long as it takes\" to have it his way. Seems totally ridiculous that our government, and indeed Country, cannot ask a basic question of Citizenship in a very expensive, detailed and important Census, in this case for 2020. I have asked the lawyers if they can delay the Census, no matter how long, until the..... But Census Bureau officials say such a question will chill cooperation, suppress the count by millions and distort the relative populations of states. They say counting all persons present in the country has been the mission of the census since it was invented in the Constitution. States sued to block the citizenship question and in June the U.S. Supreme Court ruled it could only be added with proper justification. Chief Justice John Roberts said the justification the administration had offered \u2013 to help enforce the Voting Rights Act \u2013 was not supported by evidence. \"Contrived\" was the term he used. So now we have a court fight and a loud, cacophonous argument about racism and the rule of law on the other.  And you can practically hear Americans asking: when did the census get so political? And the answer to that question is: Right from the start. The whole idea of the census originally was to decide how many seats each state would get in Congress. Each state would get two seats in the Senate, with the seats in the House of Representatives determined based on population. As the system evolved, the states also drew districts so the House members would represent the various parts of each state. State legislatures were apportioned and mapped in the same way. These vital functions of the democratic system have been triggered by each new census with remarkable regularity since 1790 \u2014 except that one time they weren't. The special case of the 1920 census It was just a century ago when the 1920 Census came in and the Congress chose to ignore it. The reasons were as political as they could be, and it was all about immigration and the rising power of the cities \u2014 tensions that persist in the present day census crisis as well. The problem was that the 1920 census had definitively proved that America had become an urban nation \u2013 and, more than ever, a nation of immigrants. Less than half the U.S. population still lived on farms, in rural areas or in towns smaller than 2,500. In a little more than a single generation, jobs and commerce and culture had lured millions to America's cities and metro areas. Many came from the countryside, many came from other countries \u2013 and both movements posed challenges to the establishment in Washington. The Congress of the early 1920s was still dominated by members elected from rural districts, reflecting the economics and politics of the previous century. These included Democrats from the rural South, but Republicans dominated the rural areas everywhere else and enjoyed clear majorities in both chambers of Congress. These incumbents in both parties knew that a reapportionment would cost some of their states seats. Beyond that, the subsequent redrawing of the districts would force individual members to compete with each other in a game of musical chairs. Moreover, the new seats to be created would be centered in the metro areas where city folk would people would vote for someone of their own. So these incumbents attacked the census as inaccurate, as well as insensate to the rural soul of the nation as they knew it. The agrarian worldview of Thomas Jefferson was still like religion to much of Congress. (Jefferson once wrote that \"The mobs of great cities add just as much to the support of pure government as sores do to the strength of the human body.\") Just as obvious as the growth of cities was the contribution immigrants were making to that growth. The percentage of foreign-born residents in the U.S. had spiked to a record high (13.5%) in the  decade before 1920, and it was concentrated in the industrial metros of the Northeast and the Great Lakes. Republicans in Congress saw the arrival of immigrants as a direct threat. One member from Kansas had a chart suggesting that the counting of non-citizens nationally had an impact on the number of seats apportioned to 16 states. He proposed a constitutional amendment to bar the census from counting anyone who had not become a naturalized citizen. Members from Kentucky and Tennessee said they wanted to do the same. In response, the Republican leaders in Congress simply stalled the reapportionment bill that would have normally been enacted after the census. And they stalled it all the way through the next four congressional election cycles. It was not until 1929 that a reapportionment law was finally enacted \u2013 even as the 1930 census was being prepared. Roots of the contemporary controversy The original Constitution (Article I, Section 2) committed to a House of 65 seats, assigned to the states based on their relative, approximate population. Thus Virginia would have 10, Pennsylvania and Massachusetts eight each, and so on \u2013 down to Delaware and Rhode Island with one each. But the original ratio was just a starting point. The Constitution set in motion an \"actual enumeration\" of residents, and the first census takers rode out on horseback in 1790. All the other uses of the census we know today, from the distribution of federal program funds to the myriad commercial and academic purposes, came later. And they were all ancillary to the original idea of popular representation, an essential tool for a democratic republic. The census, and the apportionment of seats that followed, was a mechanism that also recognized the reality that the new nation was not one unit but a union of  previously sovereign states. It was a contract among several separate entities that insisted on their own rights and identities. Given these origins, the census and reapportionment are inevitably controversial. Attendees at the Philadelphia Convention in 1787 argued long and hard about how to count slaves, an issue that nearly caused the whole enterprise to collapse. In the end, the convention adopted the \"three-fifths compromise\" by which slaves would count in the census but only as three-fifths of a person. That compromise may seem shocking today. But in the America of 1787, it got the deal done. And it persisted until the Civil War brought the 13th and 14th Amendments and a mandate for \"counting the whole number of persons in each State.\" In the 20th Century, the census was a hot potato for other reasons. It figured in the measuring of unemployment during the Great Depression. It played a role in the efforts to redraw congressional districts within the states during the Civil Rights Movement. In the years before and after the census of 2000, more attention was paid to the under-counting of some groups \u2013 especially newer arrivals and people of color. Efforts to supplement the census \"nose count\" with statistical sampling and other contemporary techniques of social science met stiff resistance from Republicans in Congress. More recently, questions have been raised about the Census Bureau's definitions of terms such as marriage and family \u2014 and also its determinations of gender. And now, under the Trump administration, the census has once again come to focus on the issue of immigration. Many of the tensions of 1920 Census persist today Both the rural-urban tension and the immigration pressure of 1920 are palpable in the conflicts of the upcoming census. The distinction between voting patterns of metro and non-metro residents is stark. Exit polls in 2016 showed Trump receiving 62% of the vote in rural areas but just 35% in urban precincts. A national poll by Selzer & Co. for Grinnell College in December found corroborating evidence: Trump had 61% approval in rural areas and just 31% in urban (with suburbs and small towns in the low 40s). But the cutting edge of the census issue in our day is the immigration issue, as highlighted by the president's own emphasis on it. Trump first emerged from the pack of Republican candidates in 2015 by emphasizing his support for a border wall with Mexico and a \"total and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the U.S. until we figure out what the hell is going on.\" Frustrated so far in his efforts to build that wall, or to overhaul immigration law more generally, the president has looked for other ways to force the issue.  These have included his challenge to the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program benefiting those brought to the U.S. illegally as minors. Most visible in recent days has been the policy of separating families of asylum-seekers at the Mexican border, and the controversies over the conditions in detention camps for children. Given the adverse public reaction to both these initiatives, the president may sense greater acceptance of his citizenship question on the census. And if denied the question by the courts, the president can surely make that a grievance to campaign on in 2020. This post was originally published on July 9, 2019.",

After a gunman shot and killed 22 people at an El Paso, Texas, Walmart earlier this month, former Texas Rep. Beto O'Rourke decided to take a hiatus from the presidential campaign to return to his hometown. Now O'Rourke is back on the campaign trail reinvigorated, with a focus on the president and the racial division he says Trump has stirred in the country. He mentions El Paso frequently, both on the stump and in interviews; it's clear the shooting \u2014 and the fact that Latinos were targeted \u2014 has troubled him. It's become the raison d'\u00eatre of his campaign. Law enforcement's top priority, he says, should be combating white nationalism and white supremacy. O'Rourke also is fixated on Trump these days. \"If we don't call this country's attention to the true cost and consequence of Donald Trump, then the blame will be on us, every one of us who was complicit in our silence,\" O'Rourke said in an interview with The NPR Politics Podcast and Iowa Public Radio. But he resisted the idea that focusing on the president would somehow define his campaign. O'Rourke, 46, became a darling of the left during the 2018 midterms for his challenge to Republican incumbent Sen. Ted Cruz. He was widely perceived as the underdog but lost the race by just 3 percentage points, coming closer to winning a statewide office than any other Democrat in years. And because of the notoriety he gained in the midterms, he entered the Democratic presidential primary as a sort of political celebrity. He raised more than $6 million in the 24 hours after he announced his campaign. But he's consistently trailed in early polls, struggled to articulate why he's running and failed to have a breakout moment on the crowded debate stage. At times, his lofty rhetoric can seem to cloud his actual policy priorities. So, we asked him: If he had to prioritize one landmark bill, what would it be? \"There is no one bill,\" he said, and then gave a long answer detailing his concerns about a range of issues from climate change to health care and immigration. Pundits and voters agree that O'Rourke is not doing as well in this contest as they expected. As his odds have dimmed, the pressure on him to withdraw from the presidential race and instead run for the U.S. Senate has increased. Even some of his fervent fans from the 2018 race in Texas have suggested he should focus on mounting a challenge to Sen. John Cornyn, who will be up for reelection in 2020. But O'Rourke dismisses that idea. \"I think I have a perspective that is important for this country at this moment,\" he said. On President Trump The terrifying and terrorizing raids like the one he authorized in Mississippi ... [are] part of a larger trend of action and attacks against immigrants, against people who do not look like or pray like or love like the majority in this country. And if that continues, I'm confident that we'll lose this country. We really will. I liken it to being a country that is asleep and a country that will die in its sleep unless it wakes up to the threat that it faces. And that threat \u2014 very clearly \u2014 is Donald Trump. On his focus on white nationalism (O'Rourke's plan to tackle gun violence explicitly links guns with white nationalism) With 40,000 gun violence deaths in this country, not all of them are connected to white nationalism, white supremacy or white terrorism, but ... you do have to connect the hatred, the racism, the president's words and actions with the accessibility of those weapons that afford someone the means to conduct this kind of terror in this country. If I don't connect these dots, then I am complicit in the next mass murder or the next act of domestic terror. On border security There's a great leader in my community ... 10 years ago we were on a conference on just this issue in El Paso, and he said: If you want to secure your communities, if we want to secure the border, treat people with respect and dignity. El Paso, Texas, is one of \u2014 if not \u2014 the safest cities in the United States. It's safe not despite, but because we're a city of immigrants ... because we're connected to Mexico \u2014 and we see all of those as fundamental to our strength and our success and our security. On why, despite the pressure, he's not dropping out to run for the U.S. Senate I want to serve this country as president. And I think I have a perspective that is important for this country at this moment. As Donald Trump vilifies and demonizes the border, communities of immigrants, seeks to make us afraid, warns of invasions and infestations and calls those who come to this country \"killers\" and \"predators\" and \"animals,\" it is in a community of immigrants, on the U.S.-Mexico border, that I was raised. I think I can tell a very powerful, a very positive story of the contribution that immigrants make to the success of this country. In Texas, going to every one of those 254 counties on a very progressive agenda, we helped to take a state that had ranked [near the bottom] in voter turnout, written off as too red and Republican to count, to one that gave us more votes than any Democrat had ever received ... [and] brought nearly half a million Republicans along with us, helped to flip two congressional seats, and elect 17 African American women to judicial positions in Harris County, literally changing the face of criminal justice in this country's most diverse city. It's that kind of perspective, that kind of campaigning, that way of bringing people in at a very divided time. That's the way you beat Donald Trump. I think that's also the way you that reunite this polarized country in the face of these challenges so that we can overcome them.",

            "article_content": "A federal judge orders the government to release more about the Russia probe. Trump calls for an overhaul of how the U.S. handles legal immigration. A Kansas town grapples with its hospital's closure.  RACHEL MARTIN, HOST: A federal judge has ordered that the government needs to release more information about the Russia investigation, including parts of the Mueller report that were previously redacted. DAVID GREENE, HOST: Yeah. So this order came after some court documents were unsealed. They revealed that former national security adviser Michael Flynn told investigators that someone connected to the administration or Congress tried to influence his cooperation with the special counsel inquiry. Flynn pleaded guilty to lying to the FBI about his contacts with the Russian ambassador. And we have reported in the past about possible efforts by President Trump's personal counsel to dissuade Flynn from participating in Robert Mueller's probe. MARTIN: OK. We've got national justice correspondent Carrie Johnson with us this morning to help us understand what's going on. Hi, Carrie. CARRIE JOHNSON, BYLINE: Good morning, Rachel. MARTIN: All right. So explain. What exactly are we learning from this filing here? JOHNSON: What we're learning is the judge has ordered the government to produce a few categories of new information. One is a voicemail that one of Donald Trump's lawyers apparently left for one of Michael Flynn's lawyers, basically, trying to elicit what Flynn was telling investigators in the course of this investigation about the White House. Another is that the judge has ordered the government to post on the public docket by the end of this month a transcript of a call or calls between Michael Flynn and the then-Russian ambassador in late 2016. This formed the basis of his guilty plea for lying to the FBI. This is what he lied to the FBI about. And finally, the judge wants to see parts of this Robert Mueller special counsel report that relate to Michael Flynn, including parts of the report that have been redacted to date. MARTIN: And what - is there special significance to the fact that these parts of the Mueller report that he wants released - that they were redacted before? JOHNSON: You know, Michael Flynn's case has played out. He's pleaded guilty. He's waiting for sentencing. We now know more about the nature of his cooperation - his very extensive cooperation with this investigation, including some new details overnight that Flynn, apparently, was present for conversations with senior campaign officials who were talking about trying to reach out to WikiLeaks in 2016. What we may find more about now is parts of that Mueller report that were previously redacted that relate to Michael Flynn's cooperation. I'm not sure to what extent parts of the intelligence community are going to want to put the kibosh on releasing some of this information, though. MARTIN: So, I mean, we're learning more about this because these court documents have been unsealed now that the Mueller report is out. Are we going to see more revelations like this come down? JOHNSON: I think we are, Rachel, in part because of Flynn is supposed to testify or is likely to testify in a trial of one of his former business partners scheduled for July. And remember. There's another big, outstanding part of that Mueller investigation ongoing. Roger Stone, the president's longtime political adviser, is set to go to trial in November over allegations that he was in contact with WikiLeaks. A lot more information could come out as part of that trial process. MARTIN: And we still don't know whether Robert Mueller himself is going to testify. JOHNSON: To be determined at this time. MARTIN: NPR senior justice correspondent Carrie Johnson for us. Thanks, Carrie. JOHNSON: My pleasure. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) MARTIN: OK. President Trump made this announcement. He's unveiling a new immigration plan. But it does not satisfy Democrats or even Republicans. GREENE: Yeah. The president outlined this proposal yesterday at the White House. If it ever became law, it would fundamentally alter the way the United States determines who can and cannot live in America. The priority would be given based on a so-called merit system that would allocate points to potential immigrants. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Our plan includes a sweeping modernization of our dysfunctional legal immigration process. It is totally dysfunctional. GREENE: Now one major issue left out of this proposal - any solution for DACA recipients; immigrants who were brought to the U.S. illegally as children. MARTIN: All right. NPR's Joel Rose covers immigration and is in our studios this morning. Hey, Joel. JOEL ROSE, BYLINE: Hey, Rachel. MARTIN: So let's get into the meat of the plan - this so-called merit-based immigration system. How are they going to determine the points? I mean, what are the criteria they're going to use? ROSE: Yeah, this would be a really big change in the way the U.S. does legal immigration. It would keep the number of new green cards steady at about a million a year, but it would fundamentally change who gets them. It would shift away from family reunification, which has been the basis of our immigration system, really, for decades. MARTIN: When one person is allowed in, then they're allowed to bring other members of their family in. ROSE: What critics call chain migration... MARTIN: Right. ROSE: ...And supporters call family reunification, right? MARTIN: OK. ROSE: It would also shift green cards away from refugees. And it would move towards this merit-based system that we're talking about; one that favors immigrants who are younger, who have more education, more income, can speak English. And the president even said he wants them to pass a civics exam before they're allowed in. MARTIN: But this is interesting because, as you point out, it doesn't reduce the number of these immigrants who can come in, which is something Republicans aren't so happy about. ROSE: That's exactly right. Immigration hardliners do not like this because it would not reduce legal immigration, right? It would just change the profile of the people who can come in but keep the overall number of immigrants the same. And Democrats do not like it much either because it does not address their big concerns on immigration, including DACA, which you've mentioned. And Democrats, of course, control the House, so you could not pass this without them. But I will note that it is sort of an interesting shift in tone for the president. Usually, when he talks about immigrants, it's in terms of a, quote, \"invasion\" at the southern border or a threat to national security. There was a little bit of that in his speech yesterday but not as much as we are used to. And, you know, whether that is a lasting shift in how he's going to talk about immigration going into the election next year or whether it is just a momentary blip... MARTIN: Right. ROSE: ...Anybody's guess. MARTIN: But the president's big priority has always been illegal immigration at the southern border. Is there anything in his plan that addresses that? ROSE: Yeah. I mean, he says he wants to beef up border security, wants to be tougher on asylum-seekers who are arriving at the southern border and wants to deter them from coming to the border to seek protections here. But those migrants are still showing up - you know, thousands every day; more than 100,000 last month and 100,000 the month before that. Immigration authorities say they're just running out of room for all these folks. And they've started transporting migrants, in fact, to other parts of the country for processing, including now at South Florida. NPR has learned that Customs and Border Protection will be sending 500 migrants every month to both Broward and Palm Beach Counties. And officials in those counties say this threatens to overwhelm what's already an overstretched social safety net. Here's Palm Beach County Sheriff Ric Bradshaw. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) RIC BRADSHAW: It's not a good plan. We think it's a danger to this community. And it's going to put a real strain on what the resources are. ROSE: Yeah. So Republicans in Florida are asking, you know, the state's - officials in Florida asking the state's Republican governor and senators to push the White House to reconsider this. MARTIN: All right, Joel Rose on the president's immigration proposal. Joel, we appreciate it. Thank you. ROSE: You're welcome. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) MARTIN: Rural hospitals are shutting down in this country. More than a hundred of them have closed since 2010. The pace of these closures is increasing as financial pressure squeezes hospitals and small towns across the country. GREENE: And you can imagine the effect on communities here. When these hospitals close down, these communities lose access to health care and high-paying jobs. And there's also, often, this sense of betrayal and abandonment as the hospital's hometowns really lose part of their identity. NPR and Kaiser Health News are spending this year following the historic town of Fort Scott, Kan. A 132-year-old Catholic hospital founded by nuns in the state's pioneer days closed at the end of 2018, and the city is trying to cope with the loss and also trying to figure out what comes next. MARTIN: Sarah Jane Tribble is a reporter with Kaiser Health News. She is taking the lead on this story and is in our studio this morning. Thanks for coming in. SARAH JANE TRIBBLE: Good to be here. MARTIN: So with so many hospitals closing in rural communities across the country, I mean, did Fort Scott see the closure of its hospital coming down the pike? TRIBBLE: No, actually. Even though another nearby hospital had closed in 2015, the community was convinced Mercy would stay in Fort Scott because of its history. Plus, there's a lot of need there. One out of every four children in the area lives in poverty. There are high rates of diabetes, obesity and premature death. MARTIN: So what's been the impact? I mean, you've been back to visit Fort Scott regularly. How are people coping? TRIBBLE: Town leaders are hopeful that there's going to be better health care but not everyone is. In March, I talked to Pat Wheeler. She's 65, and her husband has been sick since January, right after the hospital closed. She's been driving him an hour away to Joplin, Mo., for care. I talked to her when she was smoking a cigarette outside on Main Street. PAT WHEELER: I don't understand how they can just so blatantly close the hospital. I mean, where is the humanity? You know, what are people like us supposed to do? - all of us senior citizens. And the government - they don't care. They don't care at all. MARTIN: So, I mean, I know that in a lot of communities, when they lose a hospital, they still retain some health care. Is that happening in Fort Scott? TRIBBLE: Yes, but Fort Scott was in a very unique position. While the hospital itself was owned by St. Louis area-based system Mercy, the CEO, Reta Baker, was a local. She grew up on a farm south of town. She spent more than half her life at the hospital - 37 years. Here is a bit of her talking about that. RETA BAKER: I feel a deep love and a deep passion for the community. And, well, I will go down working hard for the community. And they say a good captain goes down with their ship. And I guess in one hand, I feel like I'm going down with the ship. But I have worked really hard to put pieces in place to hold the community together for health care. TRIBBLE: So she's made sure to have the four community health care centers run by the hospital taken over by a federally qualified health care clinic. These are organizations that are given special funding from the government to take care of poorer populations. The county and city took over the EMS services, so they have ambulances. And in a last-minute save, she convinced a hospital 30 miles away to take over the emergency department for two years. MARTIN: So you're going to continue to dig into this. What are your expectations? I mean, what questions are you trying to answer as you go? TRIBBLE: So about 20% of Americans live in rural America. And it's just too simple and depressing to think, OK, these places are going to be sicker and losing population. I think the big question that needs to be asked here is whether these communities really need a full-service hospital at all or if there's some other kind of health care services available and possible for them to kind of survive and, possibly, thrive. MARTIN: Kaiser Health News reporter Sarah Jane Tribble for us. Thank you so much for sharing your reporting. We appreciate it. TRIBBLE: Thank you.

In Germany, the European Union's biggest cheerleader, the upcoming elections for the European Parliament are supposed to inspire unity. Instead, nationalism is unraveling European unity. Populist parties that rail against immigration, globalist elites and the EU itself are expected to gain seats in the elections. The United Kingdom already voted on Thursday; Germany and most other EU states will vote on Sunday. Across the Atlantic, President Trump, a self-proclaimed nationalist himself, questions the value allies and alliances. This rising worldview \u2014 that individual nations should promote their interests over those of the international community \u2014 is especially challenging for Germany. After World War II, the country was rebuilt through partnerships and alliances, notably with European neighbors, the United States and NATO. Germany is now the biggest economy in the euro zone, and the biggest champion of what Chancellor Angela Merkel calls \"shared European values.\" \"There are other countries who can go back to a more national conception of their own country in the international system,\" said Thomas Bagger, foreign policy director in the Office of the Federal President in Germany, speaking to a Library of Congress gathering in Washington last fall. \"But for Germany, that doesn't really exist anymore because all these more national conceptions have all been contaminated in the Nazi years.\" As if on cue before the European Parliament vote, one of Germany's most popular bands, Rammstein, released an album that features a growling, uncomfortable song called Deutschland. The electro-metal act belts out the lyric, \"Germany, my heart's in flames. I want to love you and damn you.\" The video for Deutschland is a graphic reel of Germany's violent history, including a controversial scene at a concentration camp. Jens-Christian Rabe, a pop music critic at the newspaper S\u00fcddeutsche Zeitung in Munich, has called out Rammstein in the past for using violent German stereotypes to sell albums. This time, he says, the band seems to be sounding an alarm for Europe. \"When you take a look at Hungary or Poland or even Italy, you have a lot more successful right-wing parties, but they're on the rise over here, too,\" Rabe says, referring to the far-right Alternative for Germany, or AfD, party. \"And that makes a song like Rammstein's Deutschland creepy.\" Rabe appreciates that his country has spent decades publicly reckoning with its past. But the rise of the AfD \u2014 whose co-leader minimized the Nazi era as a \"speck of bird poop\" in German history \u2014 shows that toxic nationalism is still a problem, Rabe says. The AfD is expected to win seats in the European Parliament in Sunday's election. After the Allies defeated the Nazi regime in 1945, the U.S. helped rebuild Germany's devastated economy through the Marshall Plan. Still, a resurgent Germany was to be feared. Before he became NATO's secretary-general, Lord Hastings Lionel Ismay quipped that the alliance was created \"to keep the Soviet Union out, the Americans in, and the Germans down.\" Then-West Germany joined the security alliance in 1955 and went on to become a key member. \"Germany, as it stands today, would not be there without the permission and support [of] others,\" says Peter Beyer, the German government's trans-Atlantic coordinator. \"We had support and permission to become a strong economy and become a superpower in the business world.\" For years, Beyer says, Germans took their smooth relationships with partners as a given. Then came President Trump, who called NATO \"obsolete\" and complained loudly and repeatedly about Germany not paying its fair share of defense costs. With his slogan of \"America First,\" Trump declared that German car exports hurt the U.S. and accused Chancellor Merkel of ruining her country by allowing in migrants. \"This administration, especially this president ... is very vocal about these things,\" Beyer says. \"And they have a different style and approach that is very nasty.\" Trump, like the populist politicians rising in Europe, has denounced so-called globalists. During a rally last year, he made clear what that meant. \"You know, they have a word. It sort of became old-fashioned. It's called a nationalist,\" he told the crowd. \"And I say, really, we're not supposed to use that word. You know what I am? I'm a nationalist, OK?\" Claudia Major, a defense analysts at the German Institute for International and Security Affairs, compares the trans-Atlantic relationship to an ancient Greek temple. \"Right now each pillar \u2014 foreign policy, defense, economics, trade and so on \u2014 has problems. It's all become unstable,\" she says. It's an unsettling time even for German youth who have no memory of World War II or the Cold War, but have been raised with an identity as much European as German. Near Unity Square in Potsdam, just outside Berlin, 18-year-old Henry Schultz grew up hearing from his grandparents and parents about the war and living in a divided Germany. \"I'm proud to live in the European Union,\" says Schultz, who runs a large Rammstein fan page on Instagram. \"I've learned it's a place where we work together with others instead of fighting alone.

She was killed in white supremacist attack that targeted Latinos at a Walmart. The torch-wielding racists who marched on Charlottesville, Va., two years ago showed the ugly new face of the far right. Their deadly rally shocked the nation into paying attention to how racial hatred could turn into organized violence. But if 2017 was the wake-up call, 2019 was the year the call was answered. \"We did see movement in public policy and public rhetoric on violence inspired by white supremacy and white nationalism,\" said George Selim, who oversees the Anti-Defamation League's Center for Extremism. Since the Sept. 11 attacks, the nation's security apparatus has fixated almost exclusively on Islamist extremists, fighting them with FBI task forces, prevention programs and military operations abroad. That focus has persisted even though the far right \u2013 primarily violent white supremacists \u2014 has been the deadlier and more active threat in the United States for years, according to the FBI. Now, with the decline of jihadist attacks and the rise of far-right violence, that focus is shifting. The past year brought a raft of new efforts to better understand and fight a resurgent far right, including from law enforcement and academics. The change is gradual, Selim emphasized, but the public and policy response is finally starting to catch up with the domestic threat. \"The number of congressional hearings on these topics in 2019 was significant, and an important metric of the seriousness of these threats at the national level,\" Selim said. \"And many members of Congress, both Democrats and Republicans, have used their public profiles to condemn these lethal forms of violent extremism, but more still needs to be done to appropriately resource these threats at the federal, state and local levels.\" Among the responses to far-right violence in the past year: Extremism monitors say some of the measures have been in the works for a while, but were accelerated by the pace and violence of incidents. In 2019, white supremacists staged several high-profile attacks around the world, from the mass killing in March of Muslim worshipers in Christchurch, New Zealand, to the massacre of Latino shoppers at a Walmart in El Paso, Texas, in August. President Trump's response to those two attacks suggested that the White House, too, evolved over the year. After the New Zealand attack, Trump was asked if he thought white nationalism was a growing threat and he replied, \"I don't, really,\" and shrugged it off as \"a small group of people.\" Five months later, after the El Paso attack, Trump issued a full-throated condemnation of white supremacy, saying \"hate has no home in America.\" Civil rights activists said it was the kind of response they'd hoped for after the Charlottesville neo-Nazi rally, when the president made his now-infamous \"very fine people on both sides\" statement. After El Paso, there was no such equivocating. \"The shooter in El Paso posted a manifesto online consumed by racist hate,\" Trump said in televised remarks. \"In one voice, our nation must condemn racism, bigotry and white supremacy. These sinister ideologies must be defeated.\" The steps toward a more robust response to the far-right threat are tentative for now. Extremism trackers said they'll be watching for follow-through in 2020 \u2013 from the White House, from Congress, from federal authorities \u2013 on pledges to give the issue more resources and attention. The monitors are also bracing for the 2020 presidential election \u2013 hate crimes typically rise in election years, they said, and the divisions now are even deeper than they were in 2016. \"We've seen record spikes in domestic terrorism and anti-Semitic incident in the past few years,\" said Selim, of the ADL. \"So we'll unfortunately continue to be on edge as the new year approaches.\"",

How?  TERRY GROSS, HOST: This is FRESH AIR. I'm Terry Gross. My guest Andrew Marantz has spent the past three years reporting on the alt-right's use of social media. He's embedded with the people he describes as the trolls and bigots and propagandists who are experts at converting fanatical memes into policy. Marantz is a staff writer for The New Yorker and started this reporting project during the 2016 presidential campaign. He watched how extremist memes and lies were created and went viral, and he profiled the people creating the means. Marantz has also been reporting on social media platforms, like Facebook, Twitter and Reddit, that claim they're dedicated to free speech but have vulnerabilities that have allowed them to become the primary means for spreading disinformation. His latest articles are about what social media platforms have been doing and have declined to do to prevent purveyors of false news and smears from exploiting social media during the 2020 election. Andrew Marantz is the author of the new book \"Antisocial: Online Extremists, Techno-Utopians, And The Hijacking Of The American Conversation.\" Andrew Marantz, welcome to FRESH AIR. Your book is about disinformation, propaganda on social media, trolling before and after the election of Trump. Do you think enough has changed to prevent that from happening again as we face the 2020 election? ANDREW MARANTZ: No, definitely not. There have been a couple of little loopholes that have been closed here and there. But no, I think we're pretty much in for what we were in for last time. GROSS: I want to get to a good example of what you are covering. You were with Mike Cernovich, who made the whole Hillary-is-sick, Hillary-has-a-neurological-problem meme go viral. So let's start with - who is Mike Cernovich? MARANTZ: He is a lawyer and a misogynist and a married guy with kids who lives in Southern California. And he also sells nutritional supplements and hair products online. And he also is a mastermind behind a lot of memes that travel through the Internet in very dubious ways. So he is a lot of things. And of course he presents himself as a very serious investigative journalist. I mean, he is a journalist in a sense, but he's not, in my opinion, a very good one. GROSS: So tell us how he came up with the meme that Hillary is sick, that she has Parkinson's disease. MARANTZ: Yeah. So... GROSS: And this was, of course, during the election. MARANTZ: Right. So when I first reached out to him, I - this was middle of 2016. And when I first reached out to him, he said, yeah, you know, I'm happy to let you just sit in my living room and watch me do this day after day. And so I just sat with him and watched him. He wasn't anonymous. He was totally proud of what he was doing. And you know, one of the things he was doing, as you say, is he sort of said, OK; I want people to trust Hillary less. And I don't want to use sort of, you know, brow-furrowing concern to do that. I want to use really visceral emotions, like fear and disgust, to do that. So I'm just going to insinuate that she is really, really sick. Even though, of course, I don't have evidence that she has Parkinson's or anything, I'm just going to suggest that. And so he would, you know, not just sort of sit around and think about it or sort of insinuate it, he would really actively plant it into the bloodstream of the national discourse. So the way he would do it is he would open a - open an iPad. He would do a Periscope livestream; it's an app owned by Twitter where you can do a livestream. He would get about a thousand of his hardcore fans into the Periscope. And he would say, OK, guys, this is what we're doing today; we're going to make everyone think Hillary's sick. We need a hashtag. And they would all kind of workshop a hashtag - you know, him speaking to the camera, them typing in the comments. They would come up with the hashtag they thought would be the best, then they would all kind of swarm to Twitter together at the same time and try to get that hashtag to trend and put in, you know, images and sort of insinuations and wordings that they thought would be really sticky - get the hashtag trending. And then, once they got it trending, then every journalist in the world would see it. It would be on the Drudge Report. It would jump from the Drudge Report to Fox News. From Fox News, it would be on CNN, almost to the point where I could open the newspaper the next morning and say, I think this story is being reported on in the newspaper because of what I watched this guy do in his living room yesterday. So he did that with the sickness rumors. He did it almost every day with whatever he wanted. GROSS: And what was the, quote, \"evidence\" he used that Hillary was sick? MARANTZ: Oh, for that one, it was, like, she blinked in a way that he found weird - in a video. Or you know, she had parts of her public schedule that couldn't be accounted for. And you know, I should say, the Clinton campaign was not very transparent with the press. So there were things that conspiracy-minded people could jump on because she didn't always account for where she was. So they could say - oh, that's when she went to the hospital in secret. GROSS: And she did collapse. I think she had pneumonia. MARANTZ: Right, exactly. So that happened before. He was planting these sickness rumors before that happened, and then she had pneumonia. Again, she wasn't very transparent with the press about the fact that she had pneumonia, and then she showed up for this 9/11 memorial and collapsed. And it was caught on video. And people - her campaign people were trying to hide it from the cameras. So it was all kind of this perfect storm of secrecy, on the one hand, and kind of overeager dot-connecting on the other. And when I saw that happen, I said - oh, you know, this might not mean anything in any real sense, but it's going to be very meaningful in a kind of appearance, semiotics sense. GROSS: And one of your points is, here's a guy at home with a phone or a laptop and followers. And he can really make something that is not true at all go viral and get picked up eventually by the media. MARANTZ: Yeah. When I was first with him, I kind of thought - wow, I'm getting really lucky today. You know, I'm seeing him move the needle of the public discourse in such discreet ways. You know, it wasn't just Hillary being sick, it was rumors about her email; it was rumors about immigration. It was - you know, every day I was with him, multiple times a day, I would see this. And I thought - man, I must be getting really lucky. And then I was like, you know, he just does this kind of whenever he wants - morning, noon and night. You know, the way we've built our information ecosystem is such that if you're good at it and you're motivated enough and you're not ashamed of transgressing all kinds of various norms of human behavior, you can kind of just do it whenever you want. GROSS: Of course I wondered, like, how does he fund himself? Is this something he can monetize, making things go viral? But apparently, part of the how he funded himself was through his divorce 'cause his wife... (LAUGHTER) GROSS: His wife had worked at Facebook and had a lot of shares. He got some of those shares as part of the divorce settlement. And when Facebook went public, that translated to $2.6 million. But I guess he also funded himself through all the things that he sold that had nothing to do with politics, like the vitamin supplements and dieting things and... MARANTZ: And books - he sold a lot of books on Amazon. And they were self-published, which means he kept a big share of the revenue. This was just one of these many details that came up in the course of reporting, you know, on him and on all the other people, where there were a lot of details that you couldn't really make them up. Or if you did make them up in a novel, they would be too on the nose. You know, the idea that one of the main social media propagandists I was tracking got his money from the Facebook IPO by way of a divorce - you know, which he did not want me to find out, but I went and got the court records - or you know, the fact that Richard Spencer, the kind of king of the Nazi trolls, has his family wealth deriving from cotton fields in Louisiana - these are things that, if you put them in fiction, they would seem a little overdetermined. But you know, it's reality. GROSS: One of the other things that Mike Cernovich, who we've been talking about, did was he co-hosted the DeploraBall, which was basically the framing device for your book. Why don't you explain what the DeploraBall was and why you made it the framing device? MARANTZ: Yeah. So there was a campaign event during the 2016 campaign where Hillary Clinton famously - or infamously, depending on your point of view - said about half of Trump's supporters are what I would call a basket of deplorables. You could put them into a basket of deplorables. And it was one of those interesting political moments where it was, first of all, a very weird, memorable phrase. Like, who puts people in baskets? And it was also just a totem of how easy it is to take something your political enemy is doing rhetorically and just flip it on its head. So the people she was ostensibly describing just immediately said, yep, we're deplorables. We are proud to call ourselves that. We're going to make hats that say adorable deplorable on it. And it just immediately not only lost its power but it became a counter-weapon. You know, this is a thing that happened with the term fake news. That - again and again it was, you know, sort of taking the club out of your enemy's hand and then returning the beating with it. So kind of the height of this was on inauguration weekend. The people who as - the way they put it is, we memed Trump into the White House. So they like to use meme as a verb, which is, like, a pretty good description of what they do. And so the people who memed Trump into the White House said, we are going to proudly wear this label of deplorable. We're going to have an inauguration ball called the DeploraBall, and we're going to celebrate the fact that, you know, the likes of Hillary thought we were so deplorable and yet we still beat her. And as for why I used that as a device and why I wanted to be in that room, you know, there was definitely a human part of me that did not want to be in that room. There were a lot of people in that room who were manipulative, people who were trying to troll me or deceive me or get my attention as a mainstream journalist. And that made me uncomfortable. But I felt that something was happening that was not being adequately described anywhere else - that there was a lot of energy in that room. And people were kind of responding to the energy, either in good or bad ways, but in pretty sort of straightforward ways - you know, putting out a news story the next day saying, wow, there were a lot of people in that room. But I didn't see a lot of kind of deeper, more patient analysis. And so I just thought, well, what if you not only start in that room but then follow those people for, you know, a year or two years - or really go back and reconstruct how they got to that room? I think you'll learn a lot more than just reporting on the immediate effects of it. The immediate effects of it were Trump is the president. But I thought there was a lot more backstory there that could be uncovered. GROSS: If you're just joining us, my guest is Andrew Marantz, author of the new book \"Antisocial: Online Extremists, Techno-Utopians, And The Hijacking Of The American Conversation.\" We're going to take a short break, then we'll be right back. This is FRESH AIR. (SOUNDBITE OF AHMAD JAMAL'S \"THE LINE\") GROSS: This is FRESH AIR. And if you're just joining us, my guest is Andrew Marantz, author of the new book \"Antisocial: Online Extremists, Techno-Utopians, And The Hijacking Of The American Conversation.\" He's a staff writer for The New Yorker. When you decided to follow some of the trolls before and after the presidential election, you had to decide whether, in doing so, you were exposing them and therefore doing a productive thing or whether you were giving them more of a platform by talking about them in The New Yorker and then writing a book about them, letting people know their names. And my impression is, even from reading your book, that a lot of the people who have been putting out the disinformation on American social media, they want attention. I mean, going viral is really important to them, and getting attention seems to be really important to them. And you would be giving it to them. MARANTZ: Mmm hmm, yeah. I lost a lot of sleep over that. I did not want to be used as a vector for propaganda. I didn't want to be someone else's pawn. And look, I mean, I think it would be naive to ignore the fact that there is some transactional nature to all journalism and especially this kind of journalism that, as you say, is really fundamentally about attention. There are a lot of people in the book who thrive on any kind of attention, whether it's positive or negative. They monetize it. They use it to build their brand up. So I knew that that would be part of it. And a lot of times, when a person or an event or a storyline didn't meet a certain threshold of newsworthiness or instructiveness or any of these other things, I didn't include it. And that's - the majority of things didn't reach that threshold. But I did feel that it was worth wrestling with that tension and sometimes writing about it anyway - staying around long enough to see people when their masks start to slip and also seeing it in the context of what it means for our larger information ecosystem. And again, a lot of it was because I just felt a lot of people who are not part of these sort of ostensible fringes - by not looking at what the fringes do, they are really preventing themselves from being able to inoculate themselves and the rest of society against these tricks. You know, they make themselves sitting ducks, in a way. GROSS: One of the people who you write about in your new book is Mike Enoch. He is the founder of the blog The Right Stuff - and that's right as in far-right - and the founder of the podcast \"The Daily Shoah,\" which is obviously a joke on the name \"The Daily Show\" and the Shoah, the Holocaust. And... MARANTZ: Yeah, it's hilarious. GROSS: Yeah. And no surprise, the podcast is very anti-Semitic and white supremacist. So tell us about Mike Enoch and what The Right Stuff is. MARANTZ: Yeah. So this is another one where I really struggled with whether to pay this any attention or whether to just leave it alone. You know, it's obviously extremely toxic stuff. And you know, I'm Jewish. I didn't particularly want to spend a lot of time looking into, you know, arguably the nation's leading anti-Semitic propagandist. It wasn't fun for me. But there came a time when Mike Enoch got doxxed. So that's - Mike Enoch isn't his real name. And doxxing is when you sort of, as a retribution or punishment, put out people's personal information against their will. So some online activists found out who he really was, put that information out there, and who he turned out to be was a guy named Mike Peinovich, living on the Upper East Side of Manhattan. He was married to a Jewish woman. He came from Maplewood and Montclair - these very sort of progressive, kind of multicultural suburbs in New Jersey. He had gone to high school with Lauryn Hill and Zach Braff. His father was a professor of \"Beowulf.\" He had an adopted brother who was biracial. So again, as often happened when I would delve into this stuff, it just - none of it was what I had thought it would be if I was just sort of using my caricature, fill-in-the-blanks imagination. And at that point, I was intrigued. So I actually - I wrote to him, to the propagandist, and I also wrote to another email address called Mike Peinovich, and that one turned out to be his father, Mike Peinovich Sr. And then it - I ended up finding a kind of family saga buried in it. GROSS: So let's get back to what his blog, \"The Right Stuff,\" and his podcast, \"The Daily Shoa,\" are like and how much influence they actually seem to have. MARANTZ: Yeah. So as with a lot of fringe things, they are extremely, frankly anti-Semitic, racist. The aesthetic is kind of like drive-time radio, shock jock from the '90s kind of thing. They were big fans of The Jerky Boys and \"Opie and Anthony.\" So it was kind of that aesthetic mixed with just shockingly, horrifyingly racist stuff. So as for how influential it is, on the one hand, you know, you don't hear a lot of people walking around just openly talking like that, but on the other hand - because all these things are interconnected and because the entire, you know, circulatory system of American media is sort of one big thing now - you do sometimes see memes that they invented permeating across the entire system. So you know, they - for instance, they invented the meme of putting three parentheses around the names of Jewish people. That was then something you saw everywhere. So a lot of... GROSS: Like, on Twitter, a lot of, like, Jewish journalists have the three parentheses around each side of their name to say, yeah, I'm Jewish, and I'm proud of that. That's fine. MARANTZ: Yeah, to kind of reclaim it. GROSS: Yeah, to reclaim it so that you can't be attacked for being Jewish. You're saying, yeah, I am. MARANTZ: Yeah. And so that was the kind of thing where most people who did that probably had no idea where it originated, and yet if you actually go trace that meme back to its source, what you see is that this wasn't - it obviously wasn't just innocent fun. It also wasn't just a way to make Jews feel upset and afraid, although it was that, too. It was specifically - what they were interested in doing was called naming the Jew. So they're very put off by the fact that Jews can appear to be white, but in their pseudoscientific hierarchy, Jews are not white. And they're very, very concerned with this. You know, Jews are these shape-shifters, these scary creatures to them. And so the first order of business to them was to point out where all the Jews were so that innocent white people could know and could rise up against them. So a lot of people who were playing around with this meme on Twitter would not have known its true origins, and in a sense, that's how they like it. You know, they want to stay in the shadows. GROSS: There seems to be this odd mix of wanting to stay in the shadows and wanting to be famous and have a lot of power. MARANTZ: Yeah, it is... GROSS: I guess he's maybe more of an in-the-shadows guy (laughter). MARANTZ: He's sort of the guy behind the guy. I mean, he's, in a way, kind of this Cerno (ph) who puts words in Richard Spencer's mouth. But... GROSS: Literally? Like, I mean, not literally Cerno, but literally, he put words in Richard Spencer's mouth? They've worked closely together? MARANTZ: Often, yeah. They became very close allies, and Richard Spencer would often go on \"The Daily Shoa.\" And what Enoch would do - he called them narratives. So he would sort of set the narratives. So Enoch and his co-hosts would sort of say, OK, well, I think a good narrative for this moment would be to do X, Y or Z. So for instance, they were very interested in getting the word cuck-servative (ph) to permeate through the national discourse. Now, that's such a gross word that I almost can't really define it on public radio. But in a way, that's kind of the point, right? Their goal would be to get people like me saying that word in polite company. The way that starts is by kibitzing on their podcast and saying, OK, how can we do this? And who do we go after on Twitter? What emotions do we create in that person to get them to almost become a host for this mental virus that can then be propagated through the rest of society? So yeah, definitely, people like Richard Spencer, people like Jason Kessler who organized the Charlottesville rally - all these people would kind of gather in these small rooms where it was just the inner circle of the hardcore who were listening, and then from there, it would kind of permeate in multiple directions. GROSS: My guest is Andrew Marantz, a staff writer for The New Yorker and author of the new book \"Antisocial: Online Extremists, Techno Utopians, And The Hijacking Of The American Conversation.\" After a break, we'll talk about what Facebook and Twitter are and aren't doing to prevent false news and smears from being spread through political ads. And our TV critic David Bianculli will preview the new Disney streaming service. I'm Terry Gross, and this is FRESH AIR. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) GROSS: This is FRESH AIR. I'm Terry Gross. Let's get back to my interview with Andrew Marantz, author of the new book \"Antisocial: Online Extremists, Techno-Utopians, And The Hijacking Of The American Conversation.\" He spent the past three years, starting with the 2016 presidential campaign, embedding with online extremists, profiling them, and watching them create viral memes. He's also written about social media platforms like Facebook, Twitter and Reddit and what they have and have not done to prevent their platforms from being used to spread lies, smears and hate speech. When we left off, we were talking about Mike Enoch, who Marantz describes as a white supremacist. Enoch founded the blog The Right Stuff and the podcast \"The Daily Shoah.\" The title is a play on \"The Daily Show\" and the Shoah, a Hebrew word for the Holocaust. When Mike Enoch was doxxed, the information came out that his wife is Jewish, and I think you confirmed that. MARANTZ: Yeah. GROSS: Did you talk to him about that? I mean 'cause he's basically a white supremacist. Is that... MARANTZ: Mmm hmm, yeah. GROSS: White nationalist - whatever word he... MARANTZ: He prefers white nationalist. I think white supremacist is more than fair. GROSS: There you go. And I assume anti-Semitism is a part of that. MARANTZ: Definitely, yeah. GROSS: Yes. MARANTZ: Yeah. Well - so I talked to him about it at length. And part of it was just that he hadn't been what they call red-pilled yet when he met her. So he hadn't had this conversion experience yet when he met her. When he met her, it didn't matter to him at all that she was Jewish 'cause he grew up in bucolic suburban New Jersey, where half his friends were Jewish. Then, his kind of eyes were opened to the centrality of the Jews in this massive conspiracy. And then it was essentially like a Greek tragedy for him. Like, he was a really isolated person, and his wife was really the only person who understood him in the world. And in a way, he had found the one thing that could risk driving them apart. And in a sense, it just felt like a random tragedy to him. But as I learned more about his story, it seemed fitting because he was just one of these people - and there are many of them in the book - who was so addicted to contrarianism that they will find a way to be contrary to anything in their lives, even at the deepest levels. So there are some people who just want to be contrary where they, you know, hear something on the news and they say, I don't know. I'm skeptical of that. Some people take that so far that they will be contrarian even to the point of trying to ruin their own marriages and their own lives. It's tragic in a way. GROSS: Is he still married? MARANTZ: No. No, they separated. She claimed that she wasn't really aware of what his podcast was about while it was happening. I... GROSS: \"The Daily Shoah\"? MARANTZ: The Daily - exactly, yeah. Not only is it implausible, but I have some reporting that pretty clearly shows that that's not true. And you know, it just makes you wonder - like, how could a Jewish woman have sat there and stayed married to this guy? And just one of the things I found again and again and again is that people are just weirder than we could possibly imagine. They have more flexibility. They have maybe more kind of emptiness at the core of their political ideology than we think. It's made me, really, honestly change the way I think about politics. You know, when we talk about people's political convictions and say - some voters like free trade, and others like, you know, protectionism - it - just, like, a lot of people are just way more open to vast, strange conversion on all kinds of things than we ever think possible. GROSS: So Enoch is anti-Semitic, racist and promotes those thoughts on his blog and podcast. Did he support Donald Trump during the election? Does he support President Trump now? Did he play any role in promoting Trump? MARANTZ: Yeah. So he and the rest of the alt-right definitely supported Trump during the campaign and saw him as the best they were ever going to get from a plausible presidential candidate. I mean, they saw him as someone who would give voice to their kind of white identity movement in a tacit way but still in a way that sounded very clear to them. After he became president, he started to alienate them by being erratic and inconsistent - also by being a little too hawkish. A lot of these people came out of anti-war organizing, either from the left or the right or both. So when he started dropping bombs on Syria, a lot of the alt-right stopped being Trump supporters. And then also when he failed to build the wall and failed to enact what they wanted, which was essentially a proto-white nationalist agenda, he lost a lot of their support, too. But a lot of them - you know, in a way the anti-Semitism, it's not just a kind of purely irrational - I mean, it's obviously irrational, but it doesn't come out of nowhere. A lot of it for them comes out of what they perceive as libertarian or anti-war politics. GROSS: So if Trump were to run again, do you think he'd have the support of Mike Enoch or other people that you've written about in the book? MARANTZ: Yeah, it's a really good question. A lot of them have moved on to other people like Tulsi Gabbard. A lot of people in my book are really into Tulsi these days. GROSS: Really? How come? MARANTZ: Because - well, for one, she's just the most anti-war candidate. And some of them are almost single-issue voters in that way. But others, they really stand so far outside the political system that they know that they're not going to get most of what they want from any particular candidate. So they're - you know, like all sort of radical politics, it's a question of getting what you can from the mainstream system. So do you do that by doing it the way they did in 2016 - by saying - you know, Trump might not be a full white nationalist, but he's signaling enough toward white nationalism that he's our guy - or do you do it by, you know, heightening the contradiction and accelerating things - you know, trying to support someone who's so against what you believe that they're going to sort of accelerate the system into chaos from your point of view? GROSS: So Hillary Clinton said that Tulsi Gabbard has been getting support from Russia. MARANTZ: Mmm hmm. GROSS: Do you know anything about that? I mention that just 'cause I was surprised to hear that she's getting so much support from extremists on the far right. MARANTZ: Yeah. So I think there are two plausible ways to read this. One is that Gabbard is outside of the mainstream on foreign policy issues and she is pushing an agenda that she feels strongly about, and her opponents, former and current, are smearing her for it. Another way to look at it is her agenda seems so closely aligned with Putin's and Assad's that maybe that's not a coincidence. Now, I don't know. It's possible that somebody with subpoena power will find out at some point. But in a way, if you're a Russian state actor, kind of all you might need is just that insinuation and that lack of clarity. We don't know exactly what Putin wants, but it seems, from the reporting I've read, that what Putin mostly wants is for Americans to be confused and distrustful and not be able to believe their own eyes when they see something. So if Americans are looking at a presidential candidate and not knowing whether she's a Russian asset or not, that seems to fulfill a large part of Putin's motives whether she is or she isn't. GROSS: Well, let's take a short break here, and then we'll talk some more. If you're just joining us, my guest is Andrew Marantz. He's a staff writer for The New Yorker and author of the new book \"Antisocial: Online Extremists, Techno-Utopians And The Hijacking Of The American Conversation.\" We'll be right back after a short break. This is FRESH AIR. (SOUNDBITE OF NOAM WIESENBERG'S \"DAVKA\") GROSS: This is FRESH AIR. And if you're just joining us, my guest is Andrew Marantz, a staff writer for The New Yorker and author of the new book \"Antisocial: Online Extremists, Techno-Utopians And The Hijacking Of The American Conversation.\" And during the 2016 presidential campaign and then after, he followed and, you know, interviewed and spoke with, spent time with a lot of people on the far right who had figured out how to make things go viral and, in that sense, were having a big contribution to the American conversation about Donald Trump and American politics. Do you see any echoing of the extremists who you write about in your book on Fox News? Did Fox News pick up on the blog posts and memes that these people put out? MARANTZ: Yeah, definitely. This is another case where, you know, I don't have subpoena power. I can't order Tucker Carlson and Laura Ingraham and whoever else to turn over their cell phones to me. But I could ask the \"alt-right\" people what they thought. And they told me, yeah, when I watch Laura Ingraham, I get the sense that when she's talking about globalist elites and rootless cosmopolitans, she's really talking about the JQ. And when they say the JQ, that's their abbreviation for the Jewish question. So their sense often was, yeah, you know, these people might be saying things like globalists and elites, but they're really talking about the Jews. Or Tucker Carlson might be saying immigrants are dirty, meaning that he's concerned about the literal issue of litter collection on the border, but we know that - what he means when he says immigrants are dirty. To them, they saw those things as dog whistles. Now, the nature of a dog whistle is that I can't definitively prove what was in someone's mind or heart when they said it, but the echoes are very strong. GROSS: There's a lot of pressure now on social media to prevent smears, hate speech, threats, disinformation, propaganda. And, you know, Facebook is a good example of a company that appears to be trying to deal with it. So what has Facebook done recently to try to cut down on propaganda, disinformation, smears, threats? MARANTZ: So in one sense, Facebook is doing a lot of stuff. In another sense, they're kind of running away from their responsibility. Often, something really awful will happen on Facebook. Like, they will add fuel to the fire of Rohingya genocide in Myanmar, or in Sri Lanka, they had to just shut down - essentially, shut down the Internet for a few days because people were inciting so much violence. Now, we can't lay all of that at the feet of Mark Zuckerberg. Obviously, violence and ethnic strife and all those things existed before the semiconductor did. But for a long time, the reason I was so obsessed with this ideology of laissez faire - the reason that techno-utopianism is in the subtitle of my book is that when you just believe to your core that everything will be sorted out by the marketplace of ideas in the long run, you're much more reluctant to do anything in the present to impede people saying anything they want to say. And I think we've reached a point now where we really recognize how irresponsible that is. What worries me about Facebook right now is that they do keep kind of falling back on that rhetoric. I mean, Mark Zuckerberg gave a speech recently at Georgetown University. It was a 40-minute written speech from a lectern with teleprompters. I mean, for someone who doesn't like being thought of as a politician-like political figure, he really made himself seem sort of analogous to a politician in that setting. And his entire speech was just about freedom of expression. You know, we love freedom of expression. Facebook is here to protect free speech. And it's the kind of airy abstraction that sounds nice. But in practice, what it's being used for is to avoid the responsibility that Facebook has to be a responsible gatekeeper, to be a curator of information. It's essentially being used as a cop-out. GROSS: Mark Zuckerberg said that Facebook will continue to take political ads, and it won't fact-check or reject those ads. He doesn't see it as their job to do that. And then there was a letter from about 250 Facebook employees offering suggestions to improve the policy on political ads without eliminating them altogether. What was said in that letter? MARANTZ: It was really specific. You know, these are Facebook employees who know how to speak a language that Facebook executives can understand, so they didn't lead with a lot of broad, sweeping political statements. They said, here are six things we can do to improve our policies. And, you know, we can reduce the amount of microtargeting that is used by political advertisers. So, yes, maybe they can put up false information, but maybe we shouldn't give them the tools to be able to target that false information to single moms in Dayton, Ohio, who drink Bulleit Bourbon and go to church on Wednesdays, you know? Again, this is the kind of thing where the executives and Zuckerberg himself really, really seem determined to stay at the level of abstraction and keep the debate focused on, well, do you like free speech or don't you? And this set of anonymous engineers within the company was willing to say, no, no, no. Let's drill down on what we're actually talking about. This isn't about - I mean, first of all, it's not about the First Amendment, right? - because Facebook is not the government. But it's also it's not about... GROSS: Because the First Amendment is about government intrusion on speech. It's not about... MARANTZ: Yeah. GROSS: ...Private enterprise. MARANTZ: Yeah. The First Amendment says Congress shall make no law abridging freedom of speech. Now, there are people who say that Facebook should be governed more like a public utility, and I think that's a worthwhile conversation to have. But as of now, Facebook is not a part of the government, and it's not treated as such. And so rather than retreating to these sort of mottos that could be carved on marble statues, you know, these engineers and sort of activists outside the company are sort of saying, well, let's talk about what we actually mean and how you're actually making money by doing these things, rather than, you know, are you for free speech or are you against it? That doesn't actually describe what's happening. GROSS: So what's another suggestion that was made in this letter from Facebook employees? MARANTZ: They mentioned the idea of shutting down political ads altogether but only to kind of dismiss it. They sort of said, well, that's outside the question. And then, of course, Twitter did that, like, two days later. GROSS: I'm assuming that political ads are an important part of Facebook's revenue stream. MARANTZ: Well, even that is debatable. I mean, Zuckerberg has made a point of saying, this is such a small part of our revenue stream that, you know, trust me, it's not worth it for the controversy. We're doing this because we believe in it. Now, like a lot of the things he says, it's hard to know how much of that to believe. He says that it's not purely because of revenue. Now, it might be that he is projecting that political ads will become a bigger revenue source over time or that even if it's a small part of his revenue, it's not one that he's willing to give up, or it might be that he knows that these lines are so blurry that if he says, OK, we're banning political ads, well, what does that really mean? I mean, this is the issue that Twitter is facing now when they said they were going to ban political ads. Immediately, it led to a torrent of questions. You know, does that mean issue ads? Does that mean ads from activists who are just trying to point to climate science? You know, it becomes a slippery slope. And the move that these companies have always made is to go for the simplest, clearest, most ideologically consistent answer, which is the minimalist laissez faire answer. If your answer is, we're not going to do anything, that allows you to be consistent and ideologically pure. As soon as you say, we're going to do something, then all the questions arise. OK, are you going to do this? Are you going to do that? GROSS: Social media platforms have been criticized for their role in the 2016 election in spreading disinformation smears, fake news. So now as we head to the 2020 election, are we in better shape than we were in terms of social media? - because there's more of an awareness from the people who run the platforms and, I think, from the users of the platforms. Some of the people who you've written about have been thrown off Twitter and other social platforms - social media platforms too - Reddit. MARANTZ: Mmm hmm. GROSS: Yeah. So, like, have we made progress? Are we in better shape in terms of American social media? Russia is still quite a wild card (laughter). But in terms... MARANTZ: Yeah. GROSS: ...Of America social media, are we in better shape? MARANTZ: Yeah. Russia's a wild card. Iran is a wild card. China is a wild card. And a lot of the stuff I focus on in the book is not even shadowy secret state actors but American citizens who are willingly and voluntarily muddying the waters again and again, minute by minute, hour by hour. So, yes, some of the individual people who I write about do have this kind of rise and fall narrative. And one of the things that is kind of slightly hopeful about the story I tell is that some of the bad people do, in a sense, get their comeuppance by just kind of being shunted back to the margins where, I think, they belong. But that doesn't mean that the problem is fixed in any lasting structural sense. GROSS: Andrew Marantz, thank you so much for talking with us. MARANTZ: Thank you, Terry. This was really great.

As the bells of evening Mass begin to ring, Kazimiera Sokolowska carefully makes her way up the steps to the Immaculate Conception Church in her hometown of Gora Kalwaria, Poland, in the heart of a bucolic river valley an hour outside of the capital of Warsaw. She attends Mass at least three times a week because, she says, that's what Poles do. \"Being Polish means religion, God, children and family,\" she says with a warm smile. The 80-year-old accountant has lived through war, Soviet ruler Josef Stalin \u2014 \"we praised him endlessly when we were young,\" she says \u2014 and the end of Communism. Through it all, Poland's Roman Catholic Church has stood by the people, Sokolowska says. Now, she says the nation's government is standing by the people and the church. \"I normally don't talk about politics, but I think it's good we have a government that represents our religious convictions and that's also concerned for the common man,\" she says. Poland's ruling Law and Justice Party leads its opposition by almost 20 points in opinion polls ahead of the country's Oct. 13 election. At a time when neighboring economies are slowing, Law and Justice has overseen one of the fastest-growing economies in Europe, making Poland a role model of a successful conservative and nationalist state for other small Eastern European nations. It's also one of the continent's most traditional political parties: in a country where 9 in 10 citizens are Catholic \u2014 one-third of them who regularly attend church \u2014 what the party calls its \"pro-family\" social agenda is popular. Gora Kalwaria parish priest Andrzej Jerominek says Poland's Law and Justice Party is protecting Poles from what he calls \"gender ideology\" that is harmful to young people.\n                \n                    \n                    Rob Schmitz/NPR\n                    \n                \nhide caption Gora Kalwaria parish priest Andrzej Jerominek says Poland's Law and Justice Party is protecting Poles from what he calls \"gender ideology\" that is harmful to young people. \"Those are the values tested over many centuries, and those are values that not only lead to God but also integrate families,\" says Gora Kalwaria parish priest Andrzej Jerominek. The bespectacled cleric sits at a desk in a rectory office beside the Immaculate Conception Church. Anti-abortion posters depicting the various stages of a human fetus adorn the walls. To one side hangs a picture of Pope John Paul II, a national hero. Jerominek says the Catholic Church played a leading role in enabling Poland to regain independence a century ago, fend off near-annihilation during World War II and withstand decades of Communist rule. \"For several decades that atrocious ideology was baneful to us all,\" he says of Communism, \"because it was an atheistic ideology that took people away from God. Nowadays, we don't want new ideologies because we experienced in our own skin what they truly are: dressed in the feathers of humanistic values, but behind them, there exists great harm for each human.\" Jacek Kucharczyk, president of the Institute of Public Affairs, one of Poland's largest think tanks, says priests throughout rural Poland encourage parishioners to vote for the Law and Justice Party. In return, Kucharczyk says, the party protects the church.\n                \n                    \n                    Rob Schmitz/NPR\n                    \n                \nhide caption Jacek Kucharczyk, president of the Institute of Public Affairs, one of Poland's largest think tanks, says priests throughout rural Poland encourage parishioners to vote for the Law and Justice Party. In return, Kucharczyk says, the party protects the church. Jerominek says \"novelties\" like LGBT rights and what he calls \"gender ideology\" remind him of Communism, too. \"The ruling party is protecting us from all of that,\" he says. \"It's a very good government.\" The Law and Justice Party was founded in 2001 by former Prime Minister Jaroslaw Kaczynski and his identical twin brother, Lech Kaczynski, who died in a plane crash in 2010 while serving as Poland's president. Both were pro-democracy leaders decades ago under Communist rule. The party won Poland's last parliamentary elections in 2015 with an outright majority, a feat no party has done since the fall of Communism in 1989. The party's message \u2014 that people haven't benefited enough from the country's post-Communist economic liberalization and integration into the European Union \u2014 has appealed to a working class that feels economically left behind from the rest of the EU and whose guidance typically comes from their local priest. \"Christianity is part of our national identity, the [Catholic] Church was and is the preacher and holder of the only commonly held system of values in Poland,\" said Kaczynski, the former prime minister, at a recent political convention. \"Outside of it... we have only nihilism.\" But Poland is in the midst of a social change as educated urbanites break away from their Catholic upbringing. \"The political impact of the church is rather limited in big cities. In small areas, they are all-powerful. They shape politics as they like,\" says Jacek Kucharczyk, president of the Institute of Public Affairs, one of Poland's largest think tanks. Kucharczyk says priests throughout Poland's countryside encourage parishioners to vote for the Law and Justice Party; in return, he says, the party protects the church. \"As long as we are in power, you have nothing to be afraid of,\" he says of the nature of the relationship between the party and the church. \"There won't be investigations into pedophilia, there won't be any change in your privileged position in public institutions such as public schools and so on and so forth.\" On the streets of Warsaw, many people are frustrated with other aspects of the party's rule, especially its move to grant lawmakers more power over appointing judges, threatening the courts' independence. \"I don't approve of what's been done to the judiciary,\" says retiree Blanka Radomska. \"I don't approve of the gall, the arrogance in every area. I'm afraid that if it continues this way, they'll get their hands on the media, too.\" On Thursday, the European Commission referred Poland to the top European court over concerns that new laws strip judges of their independence. Investigations and even sanctions are expected to follow. Adding to international concern, in a 232-page party manifesto published in preparation for this month's election, the Law and Justice Party outlined new rules for Polish journalists that would create a \"self-government\" body to ensure \"ethical and professional standards among journalists.\" Human rights advocates have called the new rules \"an assault on democracy.\" The Institute of Public Affairs' Kucharczyk says a strong economy has helped Law and Justice stay in power for four years. The party's nationalist, populist message has appealed to other Eastern European countries where a resurgence of nationalism has catapulted other nationalist parties into power. But he says for Law and Justice, the upcoming election poses an existential threat. \"These people have done so many things in the four years in power that they will likely face legal actions if they lose power, so it's make or break for them, they have everything to lose,\" he says. Law and Justice politicians have been caught in corruption scandals in the past year. Poland's Parliament speaker resigned for using government aircraft for private trips. But these scandals haven't dented party popularity and losing seems unlikely. As Kucharczyk says, as long as the economy steadily grows under its rule, many of the country's voters will likely continue to throw their support behind Law and Justice.

Beto O'Rourke has promised a mandatory buyback program for assault-style weapons. But public support for such a program is divided. Former Texas Rep. Beto O'Rourke gave a staunch defense of his gun control plan during Thursday's Democratic presidential primary debate, saying that as president, he would prioritize mandatory buybacks of assault-style weapons. Quoting the candidate's past comment about selling back AR-15s and AK-47s, moderator David Muir asked O'Rourke: \"Are you proposing taking away their guns? And how would this work?\" O'Rourke answered, \"Hell, yes, we're going to take your AR-15, your AK-47.\" Here's more of what he said: Hell yeah, we're going to take your AR-15. If it's a weapon that was designed to kill people on the battlefield, we're going to buy it back. pic.twitter.com/cCEWkG6y0X \"I am, if it's a weapon that was designed to kill people on a battlefield. If the high-impact, high-velocity round, when it hits your body, shreds everything inside of your body, because it was designed to do that, so that you would bleed to death on a battlefield and not be able to get up and kill one of our soldiers. When we see that being used against children, and in Odessa, I met the mother of a 15-year-old girl who was shot by an AR-15, and that mother watched her bleed to death over the course of an hour because so many other people were shot by that AR-15 in Odessa and Midland, there weren't enough ambulances to get to them in time. Hell, yes, we're going to take your AR-15, your AK-47. We're not going to allow it to be used against our fellow Americans anymore.\" The response drew loud applause in the debate hall. His campaign quickly tweeted to promote his plan and ask supporters to donate to his campaign: Donate: https://t.co/yY8kKu7p8W pic.twitter.com/W0jj4liGkU Americans are broadly split on their support for a mandatory buyback program of assault-style weapons. A recent NPR/PBS NewsHour/Marist poll found that 46% of Americans are against Congress passing legislation for such a program and 45% are in favor. And the divide in support splits along partisan lines, with Republicans and independent voters opposing the idea. More striking is the divide between women and men: 55% of women think Congress should pass legislation creating a mandatory buyback program, and 61% of men are against it. There is more consensus on other initiatives, according to the poll, such as laws that would screen for the types of people who could use a gun. O'Rourke's campaign has taken a sharper focus since a gunman killed 22 people at a Walmart in O'Rourke's hometown of El Paso, Texas, last month. His plan to combat gun violence links guns and white nationalism, and he told the NPR Politics Podcast last month that law enforcement's top priority should be white nationalism and white supremacy. \"With 40,000 gun violence deaths in this country, not all of them are connected to white nationalism, white supremacy or white terrorism,\" he said. \"But ... you do have to connect the hatred, the racism, the president's words and actions with the accessibility of those weapons that afford someone the means to conduct this kind of terror in this country.\"",

The same day in the House of Commons, Johnson was dealt a political blow when the defection of a fellow Conservative left him without a working majority in Parliament. Updated at 6 p.m. ET British Prime Minister Boris Johnson says he is ready to call a snap election after lawmakers cleared the way for a vote on Wednesday to prevent the U.K. from leaving the European Union without a withdrawal agreement at the end of October. The announcement was the culmination of a dramatic day that saw a defection rob Johnson and his ruling Conservative Party of their single-seat majority in Parliament. \"I don't want an election, but if MPs vote tomorrow to stop negotiations and to compel another pointless delay to Brexit potentially for years then that will be the only way to resolve this,\" Johnson said after the 328 to 301 vote to seize control of parliamentary time on Wednesday. A general election, which Johnson's aides say he wants for Oct. 14, would be the third in just four years for Britons. On Tuesday, less than two months from the date he set for the U.K.'s divorce from the European Union \u2014 with or without a deal on the terms of the breakup \u2014 Johnson suffered another significant blow to his fraying support in Parliament: Phillip Lee, a fellow Tory, defected from Johnson's Conservative Party in a dramatic scene in the House of Commons. As Johnson addressed the chamber, Lee silently crossed the room and took a seat with the opposition Liberal Democrats under a heavy rain of jeers and cheers from his fellow members of Parliament. The seemingly outsize reaction was warranted: The loss of Lee's vote erases the tenuous working majority enjoyed by the prime minister's coalition, just as a possible vote looms on a bill that would bar Johnson from leaving the European bloc without a deal. The moment when @DrPhillipLeeMP crosses to sit with the Liberal Democrats: pic.twitter.com/27dOWhQw1z \"Sadly, the Brexit process has helped to transform this once great Party in to something more akin to a narrow faction, where an individual's 'conservativism' is measured by how recklessly one wishes to leave the European Union,\" Lee said in a statement released on Twitter. \"Perhaps most disappointingly, it has increasingly become infected with the twin diseases of populism and English nationalism.\" After a great deal of thought, I have reached the conclusion that it is no longer possible to serve my constituents\u2019 and country\u2019s best interests as a Conservative Member of Parliament. My letter to the Prime Minister: pic.twitter.com/0QreSbSdwR Lee's defection comes on perhaps the most consequential day so far for Johnson's young premiership. Parliament returned to session for the first time since the prime minister moved to suspend the lawmaking body, beginning around Sept. 9 and leaving it in recess until Oct. 14 \u2014 or for more than half the weeks remaining before Johnson's deadline. That decision elicited fierce resistance, not just from opposition lawmakers but from members within his own party, as well. Commons Speaker John Bercow, for one, said last week that the suspension of Parliament \"represents a constitutional outrage,\" and more than a dozen of Johnson's own Tories have threatened to back the bill blocking a no-deal Brexit. Meanwhile, protests have erupted outside the Houses of Parliament, as well. Johnson, for his part, has sought to quell the mutiny within the Conservative Party with threats of deselection and expulsion. \"To these rebels in his own party, he said, effectively, 'I'm going to kick you out if you defy me.' And this would effectively end their careers,\" NPR's Frank Langfitt explained on Morning Edition Tuesday before the day's tumult in the House of Commons. \"Some people find this quite ruthless, but the rebels' view is that 'we're going to choose what we see as the future of the country and the best interests of the country over party.' \" Johnson could also seek a snap general election next month if he does not get his way \u2014 which would be the U.K.'s third general vote in three years. On NPR's Here and Now, Langfitt explained that Johnson may choose to run a campaign critical of Parliament and essentially say that lawmakers are \"trying to rob the people of the Brexit vote\" \u2014 and that he just needs an electoral majority to push it through. \"One thing is critical: If we are to succeed in these negotiations [with EU officials], we need to get behind the prime minister,\" Conservative MP Michael Gove told lawmakers Tuesday in the House of Commons. \"And if it is the case that the motion before the House is passed tonight and the legislation which it gives effect to is passed tomorrow,\" he continued, \"then we will allow the European Union to dictate the length of any extension and to put any conditions they wish to on that extension. That would totally undermine the government's capacity to negotiate in the national interest.\" Jo Swinson, the leader of the Liberal Democrats, the party to whom Lee defected, didn't buy arguments such as Gove's \"The prime minister has lost his majority with the honorable member from Bracknell joining the Liberal Democrats,\" she said on the chamber floor, adding: \"When will the prime minister stop playing with people's lives and stop Brexit?\"",

            "article_content": "The NPR Politics Podcast and Iowa Public Radio caught up with Beto O'Rourke in Iowa. He recently re-started his presidential bid after pausing it due to the mass shooting in El Paso, his hometown.  AUDIE CORNISH, HOST: Former Texas Congressman Beto O'Rourke sees his presidential run in clear moral terms. He talks a lot about President Trump, guns and white nationalism. It's a message that he's found a renewed passion for following the deadly mass shooting in his hometown of El Paso, and it's a message he spoke about at length with the NPR Politics Podcast during a recent campaign swing through Iowa. NPR's Asma Khalid reports. ASMA KHALID, BYLINE: Beto O'Rourke took a hiatus from the presidential campaign earlier this month. He wanted to help his hometown grieve after a gunman shot and killed 22 people at a Wal-Mart, specifically targeting Latinos. On the stump and in interviews, it is clear the shooting still troubles O'Rourke. Here he is talking to voters in Des Moines. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) BETO O'ROURKE: As president, we've got to make sure that we make our number-one law enforcement priority combating white nationalism and white supremacy in this country. (APPLAUSE) KHALID: This event was called An Iowa Conversation: Standing Up To Trump. O'Rourke says the president has inflamed racial tension. He told us he's really worried about that. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED NPR BROADCAST) O'ROURKE: And if that continues, I'm confident that we'll lose this country. We really will. And I liken it to being a country that is asleep and a country that will die in its sleep unless it wakes up to the threat that it faces, and that threat very clearly is Donald Trump. KHALID: O'Rourke is very focused on Trump. When we asked him if that essentially allows the president to define his campaign, he dismissed that idea, but then he went back to a warning about the president. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED NPR BROADCAST) O'ROURKE: If we don't call this country's attention to the true cost and consequence of Donald Trump, then the blame will be on us - every one of us who was complicit in our silence. KHALID: This wasn't the only time in our conversation he mentioned to the idea of being complicit. He brought it up again when we asked him why his plan to tackle gun violence explicitly links the violence with white nationalism, and he acknowledged that, yeah, there are a lot of gun deaths that have nothing to do with white supremacy. But he pointed out that a mosque in Texas was burned down after Trump issued his travel ban targeting several Muslim-majority countries, and he reminded us about a shooting at a Pittsburgh synagogue where the gunman posted anti-Semitic comments online. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED NPR BROADCAST) O'ROURKE: If I don't connect these dots, then I am complicit in the next mass murder or the next act of domestic terror. KHALID: O'Rourke entered this race as a sort of political celebrity. He became a darling of the left during the 2014 midterms for his challenge to Republican Senator Ted Cruz. O'Rourke was the underdog, but he lost that race by just 3 percentage points, coming closer to winning a statewide office in Texas than any other Democrat in years. But the attention his upstart Senate campaign generated during the midterms has not translated to a national presidential campaign. Voters have told me they are drawn to his enthusiasm, but they're not sure what he stands for. So we asked him, if he had to prioritize one landmark bill, what would it be? (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED NPR BROADCAST) O'ROURKE: There is no one bill, of course. There is the greatest set of challenges that this country has ever faced. KHALID: He explained at length that he's concerned about climate change, immigration and health care, but he rejected the notion that there could only be one main priority. Back in March, when O'Rourke declared his presidential candidacy, he raised over $6 million in just 24 hours, but since then, his fundraising has dipped. And he has failed to have a breakout moment on a crowded debate stage, so there's been some pressure on him to drop out and instead run for the U.S. Senate. But O'Rourke says he wants to be president. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED NPR BROADCAST) O'ROURKE: And I think I have a perspective that is important for this country at this moment. KHALID: When we asked exactly why he thinks he's the answer this country needs right now, he pointed to his experience in a border city and his campaign in the midterms. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED NPR BROADCAST) O'ROURKE: We helped to take a state that had ranked 50th in voter turnout, written off as too red and Republican to count, to one that gave us more votes than any Democrat had ever received. KHALID: Technically, Hawaii has the lowest voter turnout, but Texas is near the bottom, and his point is that he was able to energize voters. The question is whether he can manage energize voters now when he's running against 20 other Democrats, not Ted Cruz. Asma Khalid, NPR News.

            "article_content": "White nationalism is not limited to the United States' radical, violent fringe groups. There's a long history in mainstream politics of stoking anxiety about America becoming less white.  DAVID GREENE, HOST: After the mass shooting that took place here on Saturday, authorities are saying that the alleged shooter posted a hate-filled anti-immigrant screed online. He is a 21-year-old white man from the suburbs of Dallas. And police believe he authored the document that was posted on the web just before the rampage. The screed, or manifesto, talks about, quote, \"the Hispanic invasion of Texas.\" Gene Demby from NPR's Code Switch podcast is with us this morning. Hi there, Gene. GENE DEMBY, BYLINE: Good morning, David. GREENE: So what do you think this attack here in Texas tells us about our country right now? DEMBY: Well, as some of our colleagues at NPR have reported, the language in that manifesto is remarkably similar to the language the president himself has used. He's talked about immigrants, especially from the southern border, as invaders many times. And just to zoom out a little bit, there was a big public opinion poll from the Public Religion Research Institute last year, and it posed to respondents a question about the country's changing demographics. Now, about 60% of Republicans thought that the U.S. becoming a majority nonwhite country by 2045 would be mostly negative. So if that's a position held by most of the voters in one of the two major parties, it's clear that this feeling about the browning of America is not some fringe political position. And to be clear, I'm not suggesting that the people who feel this way want to commit violence to that end. But this anxiety over America becoming less white, that's a common powerful strain in our mainstream politics right now. GREENE: But it seems like, we should note, that President Trump came out and did not just condemn violence. He condemned white supremacy yesterday when he was speaking about the violence that we've seen. So what should we make of that? DEMBY: So it's actually surprising that it's notable that he's done that - right? - because it's not controversial. It's almost perfunctory for public officials to condemn explicitly racist violence after it happens. And that's been key. So the consensus that white supremacy is a destructive force in American life - that's a relatively recent phenomenon. It's a fragile consensus. And it's one of the most significant achievements of the civil rights movement, which is why it's so important when leaders affirm it and which was one reason why his response to Charlottesville, that there were good people on both sides, was so striking. And so now the president has shifted back to the sort of pro forma condemnation that comes after incidents like this. But there's the border wall - right? - and now the detention facilities on the border, all of which structurally reinforce this fear of brown invaders again with legitimate policy and law. GREENE: Well - and Democrats have gone so far as to say that the president's words actually have incited violence in this country. Is that a fair argument? DEMBY: I mean, you know, causality is really tricky here. And just, you know, for the record, the alleged shooter said that his views predate President Trump's election. But, you know, there's all this research that shows a significant surge in reported hate crimes across the country since President Trump's election. But, again, it's important for us to remember that this is not new, that white nationalist violence is part of the history of American politics. Like, during Jim Crow, there were 4,000 lynchings in the United States. And the lynchings themselves were an extralegal expression of this official policy position, which was that black people should be inferior and that black people should stay in their place. And one of the reasons that anti-lynching legislation was a nonstarter in Washington - were reluctant to pick a political fight with Southern lawmakers and with Southern voters. As a practical matter, white nationalism was politically disadvantageous to confront because it was too popular. And so this dynamic of officially sanctioned white nationalism existing next to grizzly extralegal white nationalist violence, that's always been with us. GREENE: NPR's Gene Demby from NPR's Code Switch podcast. Gene, thanks so much. DEMBY: Thank you, David. Copyright \u00a9 2019 NPR.  All rights reserved.

Updated at 3:00 p.m. ET President Trump has made undoing the Obama Administration's foreign policy record one of his top priorities. So it's no surprise that former Vice President Joe Biden \u2014 who played a key role in implementing now-abandoned agreements like the Paris climate agreement and the Iran nuclear deal, sees Trump's foreign policy as a disaster. In a major speech delivered Thursday afternoon in New York City, Biden warned that Trump \"undermines our democratic alliances while embracing dictators who appeal to his vanity. And make no mistake about it. The world sees Trump for what he is: insincere, ill-informed, and impulsive. Sometimes corrupt. Dangerously incompetent, and incapable, in my view, of world leadership and leadership at home.\" Ahead of the speech, the former vice president's campaign released an online video making a similar argument. The video begins with the image of the United Nations General Assembly laughing at President Trump during a speech to the body. Embracing dictators. Threatening war. Embarrassing the United States.That\u2019s the #TrumpDoctrine.Reclaiming American leadership starts now. pic.twitter.com/8BQv50aseA Biden went on to paint a stark picture of an increasingly unstable world, made more unstable by the Trump administration's \"America First\" approach to foreign policy. \"Trust in institutions around the world is down, and fear of the other is way up,\" Biden said. \"Together, in my view, these forces have driven dangerous resurgences of extreme nationalism and illiberalism. Of protectionism and xenophobia. And Donald Trump and demagogues around the world are leaning into these forces.\" The crux of Biden's foreign policy agenda is rebuilding the global alliances Trump has neglected or undermined and using those coalitions to push back against authoritarianism, climate change, and other threats. Some of the specifics Biden hit on in the broad speech: rejoining the Paris climate accord, \"empowering negotiators\" to continue talks aimed at removing North Korea's nuclear weapons capacities, and reengaging in diplomatic talks with Iran in an attempt to salvage the Obama Administration's nuclear deal. Iran recently exceeded the uranium-enrichment limit set by the 2015 deal, which the Trump administration had walked away from. But Biden said, \"If Tehran returns to compliance with the deal, I would rejoin the agreement and work with our allies to strengthen and extend it, while more effectively pushing back against Iran's destabilizing activities.\" Biden also pledged to end the \"forever wars\" in Afghanistan, Iraq, and elsewhere, and instead focus more specifically on combating terrorism. This was one of the Obama Administration's main goals, and a focus of Obama's 2008 presidential campaign. He removed U.S. combat troops from Iraq, which critics blame as a condition that allowed for the rise of ISIS, and 10 years after Obama took office, U.S. troops are still in Afghanistan. The Iraq War - which Biden initially voted for but quickly opposed \u2014 was the main issue in the 2008 Democratic primary, with Iran, Afghanistan and several other global hot spots in the mix, as well. Biden did not address his Iraq War vote on Thursday, something that remains a source of criticism from his rivals. In his speech, Biden promised to convene a \"global summit for democracies\" in the first year of his administration. The gathering would focus on confronting authoritarianism and restoring trust in institutions, and Biden said participating countries would need to make concrete pledges to combat corruption and improve human rights within their own borders. Other policies Biden said would amount to a \"day one down payment\" on restoring American values: \"We believe in freedom of religion. That's why we'll end the Muslim ban [the Trump administration's controversial ban on travel from several Muslim-majority countries, which was upheld by the U.S. Supreme Court]. We believe in free speech. That's why I'll end the global gag rule that prevents money from getting to NGOs that even talk about family planning. We believe in the power of e free press. That's why I'll return immediately to daily briefings in the White House, the State Department, and the Defense Department.\" The Biden foreign policy platform encapsulates a main theme of the former vice president's campaign: restoring the things the Trump Administration has spent the past two-and-a-half years ripping up. But it also crystallizes the way the political dynamics at home and abroad have shifted since Biden left office. When Biden last ran for president in 2008, foreign policy dominated the political discussion. That suited the chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee just fine, and although Biden dropped out of the 2008 race after Iowa, his reputation as an experienced, steady foreign policy hand helped put him on the Democratic ticket with Barack Obama. In 2019, foreign policy is barely a blip on the campaign radar. Democratic voters are worried about issues like health care, income inequality, climate change, and above all else, the political challenge of defeating Trump. So it was notable that one of the very first things Biden said Thursday was, \"In 2019, foreign policy is domestic policy, in my view. And domestic policy is foreign policy. They're deeply connected.\" \"The first pillar of the foreign policy is to repair and reinvigorate our own democracy,\" a Biden campaign senior official said before Biden's speech. \"It goes to some very basic things including everything from remaking our education system to getting greater transparency in our political system.\" The official went on to list economic reforms, and policies aimed at boosting the middle class. That mirrors the way other leading Democratic candidates have framed their foreign policy platforms: as extensions of the economic reforms they've built their own political brands on. \"We need to end the fiction that our domestic and our foreign policy are somehow separate from each other, and recognize that policies that undermine working families in this country also erode America's strength in the world,\" Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren said last fall.",

Some 400 million Europeans from 28 countries are eligible to vote. Some 400 million people in 28 countries are eligible to vote in this week's elections for new representatives for the European Parliament \u2014 the only popularly elected European Union institution. It's normally a low-turnout affair, but this year, the Europe-wide result will be a crucial test of strength for nationalist and populist parties that want to remake the EU \u2014 and for those who oppose them. \"If we screw this up, none of us in this room can look our children in the eye anymore. If we screw this up, we screwed up for generations,\" warned pro-EU center-left Dutch politician Frans Timmermans at a conference held in Florence, Italy, earlier this month. Timmermans, a Socialist, is a mainstream candidate who's hoping the incoming European Parliament will make him president of the EU executive body, the European Commission. He's currently a vice president, part of the EU establishment in Brussels. One of Timmermans' rivals is German center-right candidate Manfred Weber, who struck a less alarmist tone in Florence. \"The essence of Europe is compromise,\" said Weber, \"that readiness to sit together and find a common understanding for the future. And to do so, I think we need optimism. We can be proud about what we achieved and we can go further.\" Guy Verhofstadt, a Belgian and one of several candidates of the centrist Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe, wants to go much further \u2014 toward single, common fiscal and foreign policies as part of a more federal Europe. \"Today, the European Union doesn't exist, really,\" said Verhofstadt. \"It's still a confederation of nation-states, and is always acting too late when something is happening.\" While differing on methods, policies and timetables, all three candidates fit squarely in the pro-EU camp, which bemoans the unwillingness of member states to forge transnational common policies on issues such as migration, security and data-sharing.

The Euroskeptics, on the other hand, complain that EU power is concentrated in the hands of unelected officials, bureaucrats who trample national sovereignty. \"This European Union could actually break apart\" Timmermans said this vote could be the most consequential in decades. \"I believe this is the first time since the beginning of European integration that this European Union could actually break apart,\" he said. \"This is no longer a nightmare or a bad dream. It is a potential reality.\" Timmermans' nightmare scenario is not that other member states will follow Britain and vote to leave the EU. Negotiating Brexit has been so chaotic, leaving doesn't seem like such a good idea anymore. Italian politician Caio Giulio Cesare Mussolini, the great-grandson of dictator Benito Mussolini, is running for a seat in the European Parliament.\n                \n                    \n                    Sylvia Poggioli/NPR\n                    \n                \nhide caption Italian politician Caio Giulio Cesare Mussolini, the great-grandson of dictator Benito Mussolini, is running for a seat in the European Parliament. Instead, Europe's anti-immigrant nationalist parties, which argue that Brussels wields too much power, are campaigning hard to win seats in the European Parliament. From there, they will try to water down the EU's federal powers over individual nation-states. Or, as they would put it, they will try to reclaim sovereignty for their peoples. \"If these populist and sovereigntist movements are rising, [it] means that there is something wrong in this Europe and we would try to do our best to change this European Union from inside,\" one Italian nationalist party member recently told foreign media in Rome. His name is Caio Giulio Cesare Mussolini, and his great-grandfather was the dictator Benito Mussolini. He is unapologetic about the legacy of fascism and is running for a seat in the European Parliament from the small, hard-right Brothers of Italy party. The campaign to remake the EU from the inside has a big booster from across the Atlantic \u2014 Donald Trump's former chief strategist Steve Bannon. He has spent a lot of time in Europe this year, closely following the Parliament campaign. Bannon has said a populist victory across Europe would end closer economic and political integration and restore the continent much to the way it was before the European Common Market, the EU's precursor, was founded more than six decades ago. \"And that is a Europe of nations,\" Bannon told reporters in Rome in March. \"Discussions on immigration and some of these basic hot-button issues, the 30,000 pages of regulations that the EU has, I think are going to start to be cut in half. I think you'll start seeing deregulation and I think over time you are going to see more changes of power coming back to the individual nation-states.\" The EU's original populist troublemaker Bannon is advising Matteo Salvini, Italy's populist deputy prime minister and interior minister. He's also advising Marine Le Pen, the leader of France's populist National Rally movement, and Hungary's autocratic prime minister, Viktor Orban. A central platform plank for all is curbing immigration into Europe, especially from the Muslim world. To promote such policies, Bannon is setting up an \"academy for Judeo-Christian values\" at an old monastery outside Rome. When he visited Italy in March, he expressed confidence in the outcome he favors. \"The momentum is on the side of the sovereignty movement, the momentum is on the side of the nationalist movement, the momentum is on the side of the populist movement,\" he told reporters in March. The EU already has one populist troublemaker inside its ranks: Orban, the president of what he has called Hungary's \"illiberal state.\" His critics call it a semi-authoritarian state. In March, the European Parliament's center-right group, the European People's Party, suspended Orban's Fidesz party for its anti-migrant policies and restrictions on media and academic freedom. But that will have little impact after this week's elections, analysts say, should Orban decide his party will join a new, populist group in the European Parliament. At the Florence conference, Hungarian sociologist Balint Magyar stressed to NPR that current EU rules already enable one member to obstruct the deliberations. Thanks to the European Union's unanimous decision-making requirement, he says, any member state \u2014 whatever its political and economic weight \u2014 can veto proposals, essentially holding the rest of the EU hostage. \"Orban, representing Hungary, which provides 0.9 percent of the GDP of the EU, wants to determine what [all the others] should do,\" Magyar warns. Polls project that after this week's elections, populists will see strong gains in the European Parliament -- not enough to control it, but sufficient to weaken the legislative influence of the pro-EU center-right and center-left parties.",

Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi has been reelected and his party is poised to take more seats than the 2014 election, signaling India's support of the strongman leader and his Hindu nationalist ideology. The voting lasted almost six weeks to accommodate nearly 900 million people who were eligible to cast their votes. On Thursday, the ballots were counted and results showed Modi's Bharatiya Janata Party, or BJP, winning more seats than any other party. Modi, 68, spent part of the day thanking foreign leaders who congratulated him on Twitter. He said he would hold onto the spirit of a \"Chowkidar,\" or watchman, which he had taken to calling himself in previous weeks. \"This is a victory for the youth who have dreams,\" he told a crowd at his party's headquarters in New Delhi on Thursday night. \"For the mother who wished for a toilet. For every sick person who couldn't afford treatment. For farmers who toil hard for the nation. For poor people moving into their first home. For every law-abiding, tax-paying citizen.\" He added that all Indians must now set their sights on the future. \"We must go ahead with everyone \u2014 even those who oppose us \u2014 and work together toward the betterment of the country.\" In the run-up to the vote, Modi's party was accused of using hate speech and fear tactics. The criticism comes at a time when Hindu nationalism has reached new heights in the country. Hindu nationalists have increasing influence in India's policies, laws and everyday life. Indian Muslims have also been targeted in a series of violent attacks. Vijay Chauthaiwale, a BJP spokesman, told NPR that religious riots took place before Modi assumed office in 2014. \"It doesn't mean we are justifying any one of the riots. Every riot is bad,\" Chauthaiwale said. \"We would give protection to every citizen of India and give their due rights.\" Over his last five years in office, Modi promised to simplify India's bureaucracy and the economy has boomed. At the same time, unemployment in the populous country has reached a 40-year high. On the campaign trail, the prime minister turned to social and religious issues. He also stressed national security in the wake of new conflicts with Pakistan. India exchanged airstrikes with Pakistan in February, and on Thursday Pakistan test-fired a ballistic missile capable of carrying both conventional and nuclear warheads. Neelam Deo, a retired Indian ambassador and the director of a Mumbai-based think-tank called Gateway House, told NPR that Modi's electoral victory will have a positive impact on his foreign policy. \"I think he will be taken even more seriously, in conjunction with the fact that the Indian economy remains one of the fastest-growing economies. It will be a policy that will lean west, more than it did before,\" she said. Deo said the narrative of Modi's party resonated with young voters, especially on social media. Ayushi, an 18-year-old Modi supporter who goes by one name, told NPR she is pleased with Thursday's outcome. \"I am happy about the result,\" she said. \"[In the] next five years, I hope that he will give more power [to] women and girls and give more job vacancies.\" Not everyone had words of praise. Simran Soni, 33, a manager at American Express in New Delhi, called Modi's victory \"absolutely appalling and disgusting.\" She told NPR, \"Anyone who comes in power is running after money and power. Believe me, this is the worst five years I have seen. ... I don't see any improvement.\" The main opposition candidate, Rahul Gandhi, conceded as the votes were tallied, telling his Indian National Congress party members at their New Delhi headquarters, \"Frankly today it doesn't matter what I think went wrong.\" He said the people of India had decided Modi would be their prime minister and that he respected that decision. Gandhi comes from a family of prime ministers, but he is not related to Mohandas Gandhi, the activist who protested British colonial rule and led the independence movement. As part of Thursday's brutal defeat, Rahul Gandhi lost in his family's hometown constituency of Amethi in Uttar Pradesh. Sushmita Pathak and Furkan Latif Khan contributed to this report.",

The leader of that party, Rahul Gandhi - he's from this family dynasty that's produced three Indian prime ministers. MARTIN: Right. FRAYER: He may actually lose his seat in the family hometown. That would be pretty symbolic. The votes are still being counted there, but that's one of the big races that we're following. MARTIN: Why did it take six weeks? FRAYER: It takes that long. This is the world's biggest democracy - 900 million eligible voters from tropical islands in the Indian Ocean to the Himalayan mountains. And the law says that no Indian should have to walk more than about a mile and a quarter to cast a ballot. So as a result, you've got more than a million polling stations that had to be set up across this vast country. MARTIN: Wow. FRAYER: And the voting was held in seven stages in different places around the country at different times. MARTIN: So sounds like Modi has already declared victory. Has he spoken yet? FRAYER: So he's been tweeting, actually. We're expecting Modi to come out at some point and give a victory speech, but ballots are still being counted. So for right now, his statement's been on Twitter. And here's what he wrote. He said, quote, \"Together we prosper. Together we will build a strong and inclusive India.\" And the key word there is inclusive because this campaign has been really divisive. Modi's Hindu nationalist party's been accused of using hate speech and fear as a campaign tactic. And so one of the challenges going forward will be to heal the country and make all Indians feel like they're part of India. We'll be watching, especially, for any outreach from Modi's party to India's Muslims. There have been a lot of attacks on Muslims here by supporters of Modi's Hindu nationalist party. MARTIN: So, I mean, did he talk about that in the campaign, or is that just his message now that he's won? Did he talk about healing these divisions? FRAYER: So Modi was elected five years ago on the economy - so on economic promises. He promised to streamline this notorious Indian bureaucracy, cut corruption, create jobs. India's economy is booming. It's actually one of the fastest growing economies in the world. But unemployment is stuck at this four-decade high. And so Modi's government has struggled to create jobs for these tens of millions of young Indians joining the workforce each year. And so his campaign, instead of focusing on the economy, which - some of the promises he made five years ago, he didn't really deliver on. His campaign sort of pivoted to these social and religious issues, instead - Hindu nationalism. So his party's called for the construction of a Hindu temple in a place where a mosque was torn down and Muslims were killed. His campaign also featured tough talk against Pakistan. Pakistan-based militants have attacked India. And actually, today, possibly in a message to Modi, Pakistan has just test-fired a ballistic missile. MARTIN: NPR's Lauren Frayer reporting on the election results in India, where Narendra Modi appears to have secured victory. Lauren, thanks. FRAYER: You're welcome. Copyright \u00a9 2019 NPR.

Ahead of elections this week for a new European Parliament, 11 populist leaders rallied last Saturday in Milan's Piazza Duomo. They vowed to reassert their national sovereignty by wresting control from European Union bureaucrats headquartered in Brussels. Their host: Italy's Deputy Prime Minister Matteo Salvini, the leader of Italy's far-right League party and Europe's rising populist star. As a recording played the late tenor Luciano Pavarotti singing Puccini's Nessun Dorma aria, with its refrain of \"Vincer\u00f2!\" (I will win), Salvini took center-stage before a crowd of some 20,000 cheering fans. Clutching a rosary and flanked by France's far-right leader Marine Le Pen and 10 other European ethno-nationalists, Salvini dismissed his critics. \"In this square, there are no racists, no fascists,\" he said. \"The extremists are those who led Europe into insecurity and poverty \u2014 Merkel, Macron and Soros,\" Salvini said, referring to German Chancellor Angela Merkel, French President Emmanuel Macron, and Hungarian-American philanthropist George Soros, a frequent target of the far right. One of Salvini's biggest fans is Steve Bannon, President Trump's former chief strategist. \"Italy is the most important place in the world politically right now, because [of] the League [and] the rise of Salvini,\" he told reporters in Rome during a visit in late March. In Time magazine, Bannon wrote: \"Matteo Salvini resurrected Italy's national pride.\" Salvini's League party began sharing governing power with the anti-establishment Five Star Movement last June. Since then, Salvini's popularity has soared. Using the slogan \"Italy First,\" Salvini \u2014 who also serves as interior minister \u2014 banned rescue ships from Italian ports, stemming illegal migrant flows from Africa. A close ally of Vladimir Putin's Russia and a master of social media, Salvini, 46, channels phrases by fascist dictator Benito Mussolini, such as when he tweeted on Mussolini's birthday last year, \"So many enemies, so much honor.\" Salvini's critics say he legitimizes words and behavior that have been taboo in Italy for decades, encouraging and enabling people to act in a manner that hasn't been tolerated since the end of World War II. Last month in Milan, men wearing black \u2014 the color Mussolini's squads favored \u2014 hailed the dictator near the spot where partisans, who had executed him elsewhere, strung up his body in 1945. Earlier this month in Sicily, authorities suspended a schoolteacher for her students' project comparing fascist laws against Jews to Salvini's anti-migrant decrees. And in Rome this month, members of the neo-fascist CasaPound group harassed a Roma woman and her family who were being escorted by police into a public housing project. Video of the incident captured a 25-year-old skinhead shouting at her, \"I will rape you, whore!\" Some commentators wonder if Italy is entering a new phase, \"fascism 2.0.\" \"Salvini is selling fascist derivatives. He's not selling fascism \u2014 although he clearly winks and says things that those who need to understand, understand,\" says Claudio Gatti, the author of Salvini's Demons, a recently published investigation into the League's far-right ideological roots. While Italy's neo-fascist activists are few, Gatti says, their message resonates with many. Students at Sapienza University of Rome hold a banner reading \"Fascism is not an opinion\" during a demonstration on May 13.\n                \n                    \n                    Simona Granati - Corbis/Corbis via Getty Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption Students at Sapienza University of Rome hold a banner reading \"Fascism is not an opinion\" during a demonstration on May 13. \"People interested or willing to listen to authoritarian, xenophobic and even racist [ideas], in a new moment of great anxiety, despair, unemployment \u2014 those people are a significant number,\" he says. A recurrent Salvini theme is what is known as the \"Great Replacement\" conspiracy theory, which he described this way in an interview with Italy's Sky TG24 news channel in May 2016: \"An effort at ethnic replacement is underway: well-financed organizations are importing thousands of new farm slaves, paid 3 euros an hour, to erase Italians living here. This is a lucrative attempt at genocide.\" Gatti says these are dog whistles that echo U.S. white supremacists' anti-Semitic chants in Charlottesville, Va., and the anti-Islam manifesto for the New Zealand mosque attacks that killed more than 50 people in March. But some Italians are pushing back. Hundreds of students staged a rally on May 13 at Rome University under a banner with the words \"Fascism is not an opinion,\" meaning it's not an acceptable point of view. \"Fascist scum, go back to your sewers,\" they chanted. \"You too, Salvini!\" Police in riot gear kept a group of right-wing demonstrators at bay while students sang \"Bella Ciao,\" the anthem of Italy's anti-fascist partisans in World War II \u2014 heralding, perhaps, a new resistance.",

            "article_content": "NATO and the EU have given post-war Germany an identity and framework in which to thrive. With nationalism fraying alliances, Europe's heavyweight finds itself uncomfortable in an unpredictable world.  SCOTT SIMON, HOST: Populist parties are expected to gain seats in next week's elections for the Parliament of the European Union. These are parties that rail against immigration, globalist elites and the EU itself. Of course, on this side of the Atlantic, President Donald Trump questions the value of allies and alliances. And as NPR's Joanna Kakissis reports from Berlin, many Germans find these trends unsettling. (SOUNDBITE OF RAMMSTEIN SONG, \"DEUTSCHLAND\") JOANNA KAKISSIS, BYLINE: In March, the popular German gothic metal band Rammstein came out with its first song in a decade. (SOUNDBITE OF RAMMSTEIN SONG, \"DEUTSCHLAND\") KAKISSIS: It's called \"Deutschland.\" The 9 1/2 minute music video is a shocking depiction of Germany's violent past. It includes a scene at a concentration camp. (SOUNDBITE OF SONG, \"DEUTSCHLAND\") RAMMSTEIN: (Singing in German). KAKISSIS: Music critic Jens-Christian Rabe translates the lyrics. JENS-CHRISTIAN RABE: Germany, my heart's in flames. I want to love you, but I want to condemn you, too. So, Germany, your love is a, well, curse. KAKISSIS: Rabe has criticized Rammstein in the past for using violent German stereotypes to sell albums. But this time, he says the band actually seems to be sounding an alarm for Europe. RABE: When you take a look at Hungary or Poland or even Italy, you have a lot more successful right-wing parties, but they\u2019re on the rise over here, too. And that makes a song like Rammstein's \"Deutschland\" creepy. KAKISSIS: Eighteen-year-old Henry Schulz is a Rammstein super fan who sees how right-wing nationalism is tearing at Europe's unity. HENRY SCHULTZ: (Through interpreter) I think of myself as a European who is also a German. My parents told me about growing up in a divided country. My grandparents told me about the war. I'm proud to live in the European Union. I've learned it's a place where we work together with others instead of fighting alone. KAKISSIS: German lawmaker Peter Beyer sees how working together in post-war alliances remade his country. PETER BEYER: Germany, as it stands today, would not be there without the permission and the support by others. KAKISSIS: After the Allies defeated the Nazi regime, the U.S. helped rebuild Germany's devastated economy through the Marshall Plan. BEYER: I love the United States of America. I always wanted to go there. We spent a lot of vacation in the USA. KAKISSIS: And for the past year, Beyer has been coordinator of transatlantic cooperation in Chancellor Angela Merkel's government. BEYER: We thought it was a given thing. Everything is going smoothly. Transatlantic relations were a synonym for NATO. KAKISSIS: Then came Donald Trump. He called NATO obsolete and complained loudly and repeatedly about Germany not paying its fair share of defense costs. He declared that German car exports hurt the U.S. and accused Chancellor Merkel of ruining her country by allowing in migrants. BEYER: This administration, especially this president, is very vocal about this thing. And they are - they have a different style and approach that is very nasty. KAKISSIS: Donald Trump, like the populist politicians rising in Europe, has denounced globalization. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: You know, they have a word. It sort of became old-fashioned. It's called a nationalist. And I say, really, we're not supposed to use that word. You know what I am? I'm a nationalist, OK? I'm a nationalist. KAKISSIS: But this kind of talk is highly problematic in Germany. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) THOMAS BAGGER: There is no other country that I could think of that is as challenged by the world view as it is articulated by the current U.S. president as is Germany. KAKISSIS: That's Thomas Bagger, an adviser to the German Foreign Ministry speaking last year at the Library of Congress. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) BAGGER: There are other countries who can go back to a more national conception of their own country in the international system. But for Germany, that doesn't really exist anymore because all these more national conceptions have all been contaminated in the Nazi years. KAKISSIS: That's one reason Germans are so supportive of the European Union. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) UNIDENTIFIED CHORUS: (Singing, unintelligible). KAKISSIS: And it's why a German public broadcaster signs off every night with the anthem of Europe, based on Beethoven's \"Ode To Joy,\" after it plays the German national anthem.

Before dawn, men gather in a suburban Mumbai park to play team-building games, meditate, chant Sanskrit mantras from Hindu scripture and salute a saffron-orange flag \u2014 the color, sacred to Hindus, of robes worn by Hindu monks. There are potbellied, middle-aged dads, retirees and a young boy in a soccer jersey and no shoes \u2014 all members of a local cell of the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh. It's part of a vast all-male network that runs Hindu catechism classes, yoga sessions and these morning drill sessions, called shakhas. The idea is to celebrate more than 5,000 years of Hindu culture. \"We recite the names of great people \u2014 sons and daughters of India \u2014 right from the ancient times to modern India,\" explains Ratan Sharda, 64, who has been an RSS member since childhood. \"See, we have forgotten our history. We have forgotten the great deeds our people have done.\" Sharda believes that centuries of non-Hindu rule \u2014 British colonialism and the Mughal Empire before that \u2014 have left Indians without a strong sense of their culture and heritage. The RSS, he says, helps supplement their knowledge. Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi delivers an address on Independence Day in New Delhi on Aug. 15, 2017.\n                \n                    \n                    Prakash Singh/AFP/Getty Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi delivers an address on Independence Day in New Delhi on Aug. 15, 2017. But it's not simply a celebration of Hindu culture. The RSS also runs summer camps, where volunteers train with rifles, and a political wing, the Bharatiya Janata Party, whose candidates now hold the highest offices in the land. Prime Minister Narendra Modi is a longtime RSS member, and the group's influence is apparent in his Hindu nationalist policies. The RSS, founded nearly 100 years ago, has profoundly shaped Indian society and politics \u2014 and Modi himself. As he runs for a second term, the RSS' influence is more apparent than ever \u2014 something that alarms members of India's religious minorities and those who believe in the country's secular basis, who accuse the RSS of chauvinism and fostering intolerance and hate. When Indians won their freedom from British rule in 1947, they established a pluralistic democracy based on secular principles, embracing their diversity. But the RSS' goal is to redefine India according to its majority Hindu faith. Promoting a \"Hindu nation\" Led since 2009 by longtime stalwart Mohan Bhagwat, the RSS is India's most prominent proponent of Hindutva \u2014 Hindu-ness and the idea that India should be a \"Hindu nation.\" About 80 percent of India's 1.4 billion people are Hindus, but there are also millions of Muslims, Christians, Sikhs, Buddhists and Jains. The constitution defines India as a secular country. (The word \"secular\" was actually a late addition to the document's preamble, in 1976, though many of the constitution's original articles embody secular values). RSS members sit in formation as they listen to instructions at a rally in Pune in 2016.\n                \n                    \n                     Indranil Mukherjee/AFP/Getty Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption RSS members sit in formation as they listen to instructions at a rally in Pune in 2016. The RSS and many of its members want to change that. The group's mission statement describes it as \"firmly rooted in genuine nationalism\" and decries an \"erosion of the nation's integrity in the name of secularism\" and \"endless appeasement of the Muslim population.\" \"The Hindus have been treated as second-order citizens by successive governments,\" it says. \"Expressed in the simplest terms, the ideal of the [RSS] is to carry the nation to the pinnacle of glory, through organising the entire society and ensuring protection of Hindu Dharma.\" (Dharma is a Sanskrit word used to describe Hindu religion, its culture and its entire worldview and system of living.) Today, many members interpret that as a mission to bring Hindu scripture into Indian law and strip Indian Muslims of equal rights, or even expel them. In 1925, when the RSS was founded, India was under British rule. The group was started by a doctor named Keshav Baliram Hedgewar, a contemporary of Mohandas Gandhi, who was agitating for independence. Where Gandhi preached nonviolence, the RSS emphasized military discipline and Hindu scripture. Hedgewar was critical of the diversity and political hierarchy of India's main independence movement, the Indian National Congress, or Congress party, and he wanted RSS members to be uniform, equal volunteers. RSS member Nathuram Godse (seated in white top at far right) at his trial in 1948 for the assassination of Mohandas Gandhi. He was found guilty and executed, and the RSS was briefly banned thereafter.\n                \n                    \n                    Fox Photos/Getty Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption RSS member Nathuram Godse (seated in white top at far right) at his trial in 1948 for the assassination of Mohandas Gandhi. He was found guilty and executed, and the RSS was briefly banned thereafter. The RSS started with 17 members in the living room of Hedgewar's family home in the central Indian city of Nagpur. Now it claims to be the world's biggest volunteer group, with a membership across India of at least 5 million. That's still a small fraction of India's 1.4 billion people. The group does not publicize its annual budget but says all its funds come from private donations. Membership is free, and people can join by filling out a form online. Hedgewar's house is now a museum with exhibits about his life and the history of the RSS. But it leaves out some key details, like how the group initially opposed the idea of a secular state and how an early leader, M.S. Golwalkar, referred to Christians and Muslims as \"internal threats\" and praised Nazi Germany as an example of \"race pride\" from which India could learn. In 2006, the RSS tried to distance itself from Golwalkar's writings, saying it no longer agreed with some of them. Gandhi's killer There's also no mention at the museum of the most infamous RSS member: Gandhi's assassin. Nathuram Godse was a Hindu extremist who disagreed with Gandhi's efforts to reconcile Hindus and Muslims. The RSS acknowledges he was a member, but it considers him an extremist rogue who had distanced himself from the group by the time of Gandhi's killing. Others, including some of Godse's own relatives, say he never left. On Jan. 30, 1948 \u2014 only months after India had won its freedom from British rule \u2014 Godse shot the 78-year-old freedom leader three times at point-blank range as Gandhi was on his way to pray in New Delhi. Godse was arrested, and the Indian government swiftly banned the RSS. Members went to jail, and angry mobs attacked their homes. Hindus shout and wave banners on top of a stone wall as they celebrate the destruction of the 16th-century Babri mosque in Ayodhya in December 1992.\n                \n                    \n                    AFP/AFP/Getty Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption Hindus shout and wave banners on top of a stone wall as they celebrate the destruction of the 16th-century Babri mosque in Ayodhya in December 1992. \"My grandfather's house was burned,\" says Sameer Gautam, 44, an RSS member in Nagpur who comes from a long line of RSS men. \"My grandmother was alone, because my grandfather was jailed \u2014 and he might not have even known Godse! He might not have ever seen Godse!\" Godse was convicted of Gandhi's murder and was hanged. But in July 1949, the government lifted the RSS ban. An official investigation later absolved the RSS of any involvement in Gandhi's death. \"We had absolutely no idea of their reach\" In the decades since, the RSS has rebounded and become more assertive. It has dozens of affiliates representing women, youth and students, all loosely linked under an RSS umbrella of Hindu nationalist organizations. It also runs thousands of schools across India. Its affiliates hold shakhas, the morning marching-and-meditation sessions, in dozens of other countries, including the United States. The RSS gained prominence in the 1980s by calling for a Hindu temple to be built in Ayodhya, in northern India. A 16th-century mosque sat on the same spot where Hindu faithful believe the Hindu god Ram was born. In 1992, Hindu activists destroyed the Babri mosque. Thousands of people, mostly Muslims, were killed in riots afterward. It was a shock for many Indians who hadn't realized the extent of the RSS' reach. \"We knew of the RSS vaguely. We knew that they were very anti-Muslim and anti-Christian \u2014 and that they were banned after Gandhi's assassination,\" says Tanika Sarkar, a retired professor of history at Jawaharlal Nehru University in New Delhi. \"We knew all that. But we didn't put everything together.\" Sarkar says she and many other scholars underestimated the RSS and its ability to mobilize members around sectarian issues. Indian schoolchildren take part in morning prayers at an RSS-run school in Assam in 2016.\n                \n                    \n                    Biju Boro/AFP/Getty Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption Indian schoolchildren take part in morning prayers at an RSS-run school in Assam in 2016. \"We had absolutely no idea of their reach, of the ground-level organization,\" Sarkar says. \"They do some good also! They provide schools in remote areas. But along with literacy, they also teach this kind of vicious ethnic hatred.\" \"To be Indian, in the deepest sense, you should be Hindu\" For about half a century, Indian politics were dominated by the Congress party, which helped win independence from the British and write the Indian Constitution. University campuses were filled with left-wing, Marxist and secular groups until the late 1990s, when Hindu nationalist groups, some of them affiliated with the RSS, started cropping up. RSS chief Mohan Bhagwat attends the Kumbh Mela festival in Allahabad in January.\n                \n                    \n                    Sanjay Kanojia/AFP/Getty Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption RSS chief Mohan Bhagwat attends the Kumbh Mela festival in Allahabad in January. \"Secularism suddenly went out of the window,\" says Vikas Pathak, 42, who joined the RSS student wing at his college in 1997. Pathak says he felt a change on campus, with left-wing secular groups losing support and Hindu nationalist ones gaining sympathy. It was gradual, but by the late 1990s, he no longer felt like his was a minority political view. And he says it wasn't just his campus in New Delhi that he sensed had changed. It was the entire country. He realized then that Hindu nationalism had gone mainstream, thanks in part to the Ayodhya temple controversy. Bharatiya Janata Party governments were elected in 1996 and 1998. \"The word 'secular' isn't even used much anymore,\" he says, referring to the BJP's brand of Hindu nationalism, which shuns the secularism of left-wing parties like Congress. What attracted him to the RSS affiliate, Pathak says, was what he calls \"cultural nationalism.\" \"To be Indian, in the deepest sense, you should be Hindu,\" he describes his thinking at the time. A decade later, Pathak left the group to work as a journalist and media teacher. He says he felt like he had to leave the RSS to be able to study and write about it objectively. He's also critical of it nowadays, calling the RSS' approach to Hinduism \"aggressive\" and less tolerant of differing viewpoints. \"A Boy Scouts organization that seeks to run the country\" In recent years, the RSS has poured itself into electoral politics. RSS volunteers participate in a parade on the outskirts of Ahmedabad in 2015.\n                \n                    \n                    Sam Panthaky/AFP/Getty Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption RSS volunteers participate in a parade on the outskirts of Ahmedabad in 2015. \"It started, for the first 50 to 60 years, as [pushing for] moral change, remaking the personhood of the Hindu,\" says Pradip Kumar Datta, a historian and political scientist at Jawaharlal Nehru University. \"But now, it is what we might call a Boy Scouts organization that seeks to run the country.\" It does that today, Datta says, primarily through the Bharatiya Janata Party, Modi's party. The prime minister, the president and most of those in India's Cabinet are RSS members. Modi joined when he was young. The RSS campaigned for his 2001 election as chief minister of Gujarat state, Datta says. The RSS helped shape Modi, and he still consults it on policy matters. Until July 2015, the RSS had kept a distance from day-to-day politics, preferring to be seen as a moral force rather than a political one. But that month, Modi, in office for just over a year, decided to attend an RSS conclave in New Delhi. He told the crowd he was proud to be swayamsevak, an RSS member, according to Indian news accounts. RSS members listen to RSS leader Mohan Bhagwat speak at a rally in Pune in 2016.\n                \n                    \n                    Indranil Mukherjee/AFP/Getty Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption RSS members listen to RSS leader Mohan Bhagwat speak at a rally in Pune in 2016. \"The prime minister and senior ministers went there to report on their policies and to get the RSS' views on policy. So that was a very overt meeting,\" says Neerja Chowdhury, a political commentator and columnist. \"You also have the economic wing of the RSS, its leaders, going to see the finance minister of India before the budget is formulated.\" The RSS' influence can now be seen in national policies affecting everything from education to commerce and food. It helps shape India's public school curriculum, which, in some BJP-led states, teaches Hindu scripture as historical fact. Through its affiliates, it has been able to scuttle legislation it doesn't like. And it pressures the Indian government to be more protectionist when it comes to big multinational companies entering the country. New e-commerce rules that took effect during the winter limit the scope of business that big multinational companies like Amazon and Walmart can conduct online in India. The rules reflect RSS views, and the group reportedly wrote to Modi, urging him to not give in to pressure from Washington to ease them. Walmart has a subsidiary in India, with stores in several states, and bought a $16 billion controlling stake in the Indian e-commerce giant Flipkart. \"The RSS is much more for the development of indigenous industry, domestic industry \u2014 and against multinationals coming in, foreign direct investment coming in,\" Chowdhury says. \"Their model is much more rooted in the Indian soil.\" The RSS also opposes some privatization of state assets, including the national airline. Modi's government has long planned to sell off part of Air India, but the deal has been stalled for months. An RSS-affiliated trade union opposes it, and the RSS' chief was quoted as saying that if Air India is sold, it should be run by an Indian firm, not a foreign airline. Minorities' concerns That the RSS has been able to wield such great influence in India, with an ideology that's often at odds with the secularism enshrined in India's constitution, worries some of India's religious minorities \u2014 particularly Christians and Muslims, for whom RSS leaders have reserved their harshest views. By contrast, the RSS has described other religious minorities \u2014 Sikhs, Jains, Buddhists \u2014 as part of India, because their faiths originated there.

For more than three centuries of the Mughal Empire, India had Muslim rulers who left a rich heritage of art, nomenclature and architecture, including India's most famous landmark, the Taj Mahal. But some RSS members don't recognize that. They call today's Indian Muslims \"invaders\" because their ancestors may have come from abroad. Some believe that deep down, India's Muslims are actually Hindus because their Hindu ancestors may, on the other hand, have been forced to convert to Islam. \"They want to erase our Muslim history and identity,\" says Syed Ahmed Ansari, 47, a rickshaw driver in Mumbai with a bushy white beard, standing in the driveway of his mosque in a neighborhood dotted with mosques, temples and churches. \"When Indians were struggling for freedom from colonial rule, we were united.

            "article_content": "Founded in 1925, the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh, or RSS, runs scout camps and charities. A profile of the paramilitary group which draws comparisons to Europe's far-right.  LULU GARCIA-NAVARRO, HOST: The world's biggest democracy - India - is holding elections. Voting started about two weeks ago and lasts through May. While that's underway, we're bringing you a series of stories about Hindu nationalism. India has a Hindu majority, but its constitution calls it a secular country. Some devout Hindus want to change that. NPR's Lauren Frayer looks at an influential Hindu group that's reached the highest levels of Indian politics. UNIDENTIFIED CROWD #1: (Chanting) Ohm. LAUREN FRAYER, BYLINE: It looks like a collection of men from all walks of life. There are middle-aged, kind of pot-bellied men. There's some retirees. There's a young kid in a football jersey and no shoes. And they come here every morning at dawn and do these exercises - yoga - and chant mantras from ancient Hindu texts. UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #1: (Foreign language spoken). UNIDENTIFIED CROWD #1: (Chanting in foreign language). FRAYER: Go to a neighborhood park in India at dawn and you may find a cell of the RSS, the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh. It's a huge network that runs Hindu catechism classes and these morning drill sessions called Shakhas. The idea is to celebrate 5,000 years of rich Hindu culture. UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #2: (Foreign language spoken). RATAN SHARDA: We recite the names of the great people - sons and daughters of India - right from the ancient times to the modern India. See; we have forgotten our history. We have forgotten the great deeds that our people have done. FRAYER: My host, Ratan Sharda, is one of 5 million RSS volunteers. They march. UNIDENTIFIED CROWD #1: (Chanting). FRAYER: And salute a saffron orange flag, the color of robes worn by Hindu monks. (SOUNDBITE OF WHISTLE) FRAYER: But they do more than morning calisthenics. The RSS also runs summer camps, where cadets train with rifles and bamboo batons. It goes back to 1925, when India was still ruled by the British. Mohandas Gandhi was agitating for independence. A doctor named Keshav Hedgewar broke with the pacifist Gandhi and founded the RSS. Where Gandhi preached non-violence, the RSS emphasized military discipline and Hindu scripture. This is the house here? SAMEER GAUTAM: This is the house. We are at the place where RSS was started. And 17 people were present. FRAYER: It started with 17 men in the founder's living room, says RSS member Sameer Gautam, who gives me a tour. The house, in the central Indian city of Nagpur, is now a museum. So this is a visitors book. GAUTAM: Right. FRAYER: People from all over India who've... The museum leaves out some parts of RSS history, though, like how the group initially opposed the idea of a secular Indian constitution and called Christians and Muslims internal threats to India. One of the most famous RSS members was Nathuram Godse - better known as Gandhi's assassin. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #3: January 30, 1948 - Mahatma Gandhi was murdered - shot to death on his way to a prayer in Delhi by a Hindu, who was maddened by Ghandi's efforts to reconcile Hindus and Muslims. FRAYER: The Indian government immediately banned the RSS. Members were jailed and their homes attacked by angry mobs. My tour guide Sameer Gautam comes from a long line of RSS men. GAUTAM: My grandfather's house was burnt. My grandmother was alone because my grandfather was jailed. And he might not be knowing Godse, or he might not have even seen Godse. FRAYER: Godse was convicted of Gandhi's murder and hanged. The ban on RSS was lifted after a year and a half. An investigation absolved the group itself of any involvement. And since then, the RSS has rebounded. It gained prominence in the 1980s by calling for a Hindu temple to be built in northern India, where faithful believe one of their gods, Lord Ram, was born. Problem is - there was already a 16th century mosque on that very spot. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) UNIDENTIFIED CROWD #2: (Yelling). FRAYER: Hindu activists destroyed the Babri Masjid, or Babri Mosque, in 1992. Historian Tanika Sarkar says it caught even scholars like her by surprise. TANIKA SARKAR: We knew of the RSS vaguely. But we had absolutely no idea of their reach, of the ground-level organizations. And they do some good also. They provide schools in remote areas. But along with literacy and so on, they also teach this kind of vicious ethnic hatred. FRAYER: Thousands of people, mostly Muslims, were killed in riots when the Babri Mosque came down. (SOUNDBITE OF BIRDS CHIRPING) FRAYER: On a leafy college campus in New Delhi, Vikas Pathak strolls the quad where, 20 years ago, he used to hand out pamphlets for the RSS student wing. Campuses were dominated by left-wing secular groups. But then, Pathak says, in the late 1990s... VIKAS PATHAK: That changed immediately. Secularism suddenly went out of the window. It is not there even today. FRAYER: Pathak says it wasn't just his campus. It was the country. Two decades on, Pathak has since left the group. And the RSS has poured itself into politics, says Pradip Kumar Datta, a historian and political scientist. PRADIP KUMAR DATTA: It started as remaking the personhood of the Hindu. But now it seeks to run the country. FRAYER: It does that today, he says, primarily through its political arm - the Bharatiya Janata Party or BJP. That's Prime Minister Narendra Modi's party. He, the president and most of the cabinet are all RSS members. Modi joined when he was young. The RSS shaped him. And he's still consults it on policy, says columnist Neerja Chowdhury. NEERJA CHOWDHURY: Couple of years ago, there was this conclave of RSS leaders. And the prime minister and senior ministers went there to get the RSS's views. You have the economic wing of the RSS - their leaders going to see the finance minister of India before the budget is formulated. FRAYER: Chowdhury says the RSS helps shape public school curriculum. It scuttles legislation it doesn't like. And it pressures the government to be more protectionist when it comes to big, multinational companies entering India. CHOWDHURY: Walmart, for instance - the entry of Walmart - negotiations are going on. But the RSS has problems with it. So they're much more rooted in the Indian soil. That's the way they put it. FRAYER: All of this matters because the RSS is an unelected group that has managed to profoundly shape Indian policy. And it's done so with an ideology that's often at odds with India's secular constitution. UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #4: (Singing in foreign language). FRAYER: The Muslim call to prayer rings out in a typical Mumbai neighborhood that's dotted with mosques, temples and churches. About 1 in 6 Indians is Muslim. They're the largest minority. And they've been here for centuries. But some RSS members call them invaders because some of their ancestors may have come from abroad. Others say that deep down, India's Muslims are actually Hindus because their Hindu forefathers may have converted to Islam - some say under force. SYED AHMED ANSARI: (Foreign language spoken). FRAYER: \"They want to erase our Muslim history and identity,\" says Syed Ahmed Ansari, a rickshaw driver with a bushy, white beard. \"When Indians were struggling for freedom from colonial rule, we were united. We were all in it together. Why should we focus now on what divides us?\" he asks. A lifetime ago Indians got their freedom and established a state with secular principles reflecting their diversity. But as RSS gains power, it has a new vision - to redefine India according to its majority-Hindu faith. Lauren Frayer, NPR News, Mumbai. Copyright \u00a9 2019 NPR.  All rights reserved.

At a farm north of Mumbai, the urine of these cows is collected and used to make cosmetics. Outside a barn in a jungle north of Mumbai, dozens of cows roam in the shade of mango trees and palm fronds. They're doted on by the farm's caretaker, a Hindu monk draped in white robes. Cows are sacred to Hindus. Saved from slaughter, they live out their days in tranquility at shelters like this across India, courtesy of donations made by worshipers at temples. Many Hindus believe cow excrement has healing powers. So every morning, when the cows awake, farmhands line up with buckets to collect the cows' urine. Dung gets scooped up and spread out to dry in the sun in an even layer or in patties. Soni believes this drying process eliminates bacteria. This is where entrepreneur Umesh Soni, 35, sources ingredients for his Cowpathy line of cosmetics. At a factory nearby, employees mix cow urine and dung with natural fragrances and oils to make soap, shampoo, face wash \u2014 even lip balm. Soni sells the products on Amazon, and has a tiny boutique in downtown Mumbai. Entrepreneur Umesh Soni, 35, at the factory north of Mumbai where he manufactures his line of cosmetics.

Cow urine and dung are some of the ingredients in Soni's products. Hindus believe cows are holy, and that their excrement has healing powers. At the boutique, a customer is browsing the shelves, filling her shopping basket with soap made from cow urine. \"As a cancer patient, I drink distilled cow urine, and this is where I buy it,\" says Geeta Jogi, 60. \"It's very hygienic and pure.\" A preference for distinctly Hindu brands In the U.S., there's a wellness craze. In India, it's a Hindu wellness craze that includes cow products, and food and cosmetics based on ancient Hindu healing practices known as ayurveda. It's become a multibillion-dollar industry in India, and it's gotten a boost from Prime Minister Narendra Modi. He's running for a second term in elections that began April 11 and will continue through late May. Modi is a Hindu nationalist who wants the country's majority Hindu faith to play a bigger role in politics, public life \u2014 even in local supermarkets. Soni says his sales have multiplied six times since 2012, his first year doing business, and that his profits have grown similarly. His company now has an annual turnover of more than $356,000, up from $57,000 in 2012. India's economy is booming, and there's a burgeoning new middle class. \"This is the modern India. People are wealthy. They are earning good,\" Soni says. \"They want to associate with brands.\" Many want brands that are homegrown and distinctly Hindu. A TV ad for a popular ayurvedic toothpaste pokes fun at global brands, showing a toothpaste package mimicking Colgate labeled \"Chemicalgate\" and \"Weak Paste.\" The message: embrace traditional Hindu remedies instead. Modi has championed traditional remedies and practices such as yoga. \"Yoga is part of India's ancient heritage,\" Modi told the United Nations General Assembly in 2014. \"It's not about exercise, but to discover the sense of oneness with yourself, the world and the nature.\" Following Modi's proposal, the U.N. declared an International Day of Yoga. While Modi has pushed yoga as part of India's soft power abroad, someone else has long been doing that in India: a barefoot, bearded, 53-year-old Hindu monk named Ramkrishna Yadav \u2014 better known as Baba (Father) Ramdev.

Ramdev became a monk, and first shot to fame in the early 2000s, teaching yoga on an early-morning TV show. Since then, he's expanded into selling ayurvedic products \u2014 everything from instant noodles to aloe vera gel (and the toothpaste whose ad makes fun of other brands).

In 2017, Ramdev's company, Patanjali Ayurved Limited, saw revenues of $1.6 billion and surpassed consumer goods giants like Nestl\u00e9 India and Godrej in volume of sales.

Last year, Indian courts ordered a halt to any further publication or distribution in India of Pathak's book, which had been published by Delhi-based Juggernaut Books. The ban came after Ramdev's lawyers filed a complaint alleging the book defames him by suggesting he may be involved in criminal activity. Ramdev has never been charged with a crime. But for years, authorities have been investigating Patanjali for possible tax evasion. In 2016, the company was found guilty of mislabeling products, and fined nearly $16,000. Dozens of lawsuits have been filed against a Patanjali trust for alleged corruption in land deals.

Citing scheduling conflicts over a period of several months, Ramdev's secretary said the guru was not available for an NPR interview. The success of Ramdev's Patanjali and popularity of cow products and ayurveda in India may be an effect of globalization, Pathak believes. India's economy \u2014 a closed one until the 1990s \u2014 has opened quickly to the world, she says, and that can be bewildering to consumers. \"It's quite similar to 'Make America Great Again.' You feel like you've gone very far away from your roots. So you've lost your country or you've lost your culture or you've lost your civilizational roots,\" she says. \"What is the one tangible thing that I can do to reassert my identity?\" The answer, Pathak says, is to buy products that reflect the Hindu identity you don't want to lose. A \"feeling of being left out by Indian modernity\" That's also Modi's message: that the Hindu faith is being diluted \u2014 whether by globalization, secularism or immigration \u2014 and Indians must protect it and elevate it in politics and public life. Together, Modi and Ramdev have managed to unite religion, politics and commerce in their effort to promote Hindu nationalism. \"Both of them are able to talk to a constituency that nobody has been able to speak to so far \u2014 not doctors, not companies, not traditional politicians,\" says New Delhi-based anthropologist Bhuvi Gupta, who has studied Ramdev in the context of Hindu nationalism. \"They are able to tap into this feeling of being left out by Indian modernity.\" The politician and the business guru are also good friends. Ramdev campaigned for Modi when he first ran for prime minister in 2014. Once in power, Modi created a government ministry to promote ayurveda. It gives loans to entrepreneurs and wellness centers, and claims to have boosted the number of ayurveda patients in India by as much as 20 percent. In India, testimonials claim ayurveda cures cancer. In the U.S., ayurveda providers promote their alleged success in treating multiple sclerosis, asthma and migraine, among other ailments. But many scientists are not convinced.

This is part of a growing retail market in India. Doubts about ayurveda's efficacy In the ancient Indian language of Sanskrit, ayurveda means \"science of life.\" Today the word is used to describe a wide array of products, from diet supplements, spa treatments and cow urine-based cosmetics to herbal medicines aimed at curing disease. The U.S. National Institutes of Health's center on alternative medicine says \"there is little scientific evidence on ayurveda's value\" for most medical issues and has warned that some ayurvedic preparations may contain toxic amounts of lead, mercury or arsenic. For consumers in India, \"The problem comes when you are suffering from diabetes or AIDS, and you're told, 'Stop taking insulin and take our product,'\" says Meera Nanda, a microbiologist who has examined the efficacy of ayurveda and wrote a book about its marketing. \"That is where the real problem comes in.\" Nanda says the Indian government's ayurvedic ministry has lax standards and conducts insufficient clinical testing. It's a parallel regulatory body that pushes popular ayurveda treatments to market more quickly, she says, than the Indian equivalent of the Food and Drug Administration does for conventional pharmaceuticals. Nanda says she would like to see government resources put toward extending lifesaving conventional medicine to all Indians. \"If the middle classes feel comfortable using cow dung soap, that's up to them \u2014 it's their money,\" she says. \"But given the sad state of health in India, and complete lack of access to proper medical care, that's the best we can do for them? That breaks my heart. It really does.\" \"The importance of our Hindu culture\" Back at Soni's boutique in Mumbai, Geeta Jogi, the cancer patient, says she believes cow urine is good for her health \u2014 and also good for cows, who are kept in shelters and having their urine collected, rather than going to the slaughter. It's like fair trade, Hindu-style. \"It's also part of us rediscovering our Hindu identity,\" she says. \"The next generation should realize the importance of our Hindu culture.\" With that, she tosses into her shopping basket a few extra cow dung items \u2014 which she likes to send to her grandson in America.

On Dec. 6, 1992, a mob broke through barricades around the Babri Masjid, a 16th century mosque in Latifi's hometown of Ayodhya in northern India. He points to where the mosque's three massive stone domes used to be. It's now an open, dusty lot, as wide as a football field, lined with barbed wire. The mosque was built when India was ruled by the Mughals \u2014 Muslim emperors. They built thousands of mosques, forts and other landmarks all over northern India, including the country's most famous: the Taj Mahal, which houses the tomb of the emperor Shah Jahan's favorite wife. On that terrible day in 1992, Latifi couldn't recognize the men in the mob. They were mostly strangers from out of town, he says. \"They climbed on top of the domes and tombs. They were carrying hammers and these three-pronged spears from Hindu scripture. They started hacking at the mosque,\" Latifi recalls. \"By night, it was destroyed, and they set fire to nearby houses.\" Latifi watched as flames lit up the night sky. Then he and his family fled for their lives. In riots that followed, thousands of people, mostly Muslims, were killed across India. When Latifi returned to his neighborhood about six weeks after he fled, he found his home \u2014 along with an adjacent small mosque and Islamic community center \u2014 vandalized and burned. He managed to salvage the small mosque's damaged minarets from the rubble and rebuild. To watch the Babri mosque's destruction, Latifi says, was shocking. But he also says he wasn't surprised. The old quarter of Ayodhya is home to dozens of Hindu temples dedicated to the god Lord Ram and related gods. This remains one of the most sensitive areas in India after the 1992 destruction of the Babri mosque. Thousands of people, mostly Muslims, were killed in riots that followed the mosque's destruction.\n                \n                    \n                    Lauren Frayer/NPR\n                    \n                \nhide caption The old quarter of Ayodhya is home to dozens of Hindu temples dedicated to the god Lord Ram and related gods. This remains one of the most sensitive areas in India after the 1992 destruction of the Babri mosque. Thousands of people, mostly Muslims, were killed in riots that followed the mosque's destruction. Calls for a Hindu temple Hard-line Hindus had been calling for years for the Babri mosque to be destroyed. It was built on the exact spot in Ayodhya where Hindu faithful believe a Hindu god, Lord Ram, was born. Some believe a Hindu temple stood there centuries earlier, though it's a matter of debate among archaeologists. In the late 1980s, calls for the Babri mosque's destruction grew louder. India's dominant political party at the time, the left-leaning, secular Congress party, was mired in corruption scandals. Hindu nationalists \u2014 those who believe India should be a Hindu nation \u2014 were gaining influence. The old quarter of Ayodhya, where the Babri mosque stood, is home to dozens of Hindu temples dedicated to Lord Ram and related gods. But many Hindus now want a new Ram Mandir, a temple to Lord Ram, to be built on the same spot where the mosque stood. Today, with Hindu nationalists running the country, those calls have gained traction at the highest level of Indian politics. Nearly three decades after the bloodshed at Ayodhya, as Prime Minister Narendra Modi runs for a second term, his ruling Bharatiya Janata Party has made the construction of a Ram Mandir one of its key campaign promises. Some in the BJP call the mosque's construction nearly five centuries ago a historical injustice that needed correcting. But moderates warn that building such a temple risks reigniting some of the deadliest sectarian violence in India's history. For hard-line Hindus, the mosque's existence was as offensive as a mosque might be to devout Christians if it were on the exact spot in Bethlehem where Jesus is said to have been born \u2014 or as offensive as a church might be to Muslims if it were on top of the Prophet Muhammad's birthplace in Mecca, says Shriraj Nair, 45, national spokesperson for the Hindu nationalist group Vishva Hindu Parishad. Vishva Hindu Parishad's parent organization is the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh \u2014 the largest and most powerful Hindu nationalist group in India. RSS members were among those wielding hammers back in 1992 at the Babri mosque. Nair, who was 19 years old at that time, remains active in the RSS. \"I felt very proud when the mosque was demolished,\" Nair says. \"From that time onward, the word 'Hindutva' \u2014 or the feeling of being Hindu \u2014 came into everybody's mind. It was a big success.\" Thousands killed Footage from that day shows mobs rampaging through Muslim homes and businesses in Ayodhya. Tayab-un-Nisa still lives in the same house where her husband was bludgeoned to death near the front gate. Now in her 70s (she isn't sure of her exact age), Tayab-un-Nisa, who goes by one name, sits with her granddaughters and pages through photo albums of her late husband. Her father-in-law had been an imam at the Babri mosque. Theirs is a prominent Muslim family in Ayodhya. \"I've wept a lifetime of tears,\" she says. She blames outsiders and politicians for the violence, not her Hindu neighbors in the religiously mixed city. \"How else could I keep living here?\" she says, shaking her head. As Hindu-Muslim riots spread across India that week, some 700 people were killed on the other side of the country in what was then called Bombay (now Mumbai). Hindus were targeted for violence in neighboring Pakistan and Bangladesh, as well as in the Middle East. On Dec. 6, 1992, Hindu attackers hit the wall of the 16th century Babri Masjid with iron rods, part of a mob that tore down the mosque. Thousands were killed in rioting that followed the mosque's destruction.\n                \n                    \n                    Douglas E.

Thousands were killed in rioting that followed the mosque's destruction. Even a decade later, in 2002, the memory of the mosque's destruction remained so incendiary that a train carrying Hindu pilgrims from Ayodhya came under attack in the Indian state of Gujarat, sparking riots that left more than 1,000 people dead \u2014 most of them Muslim. At the time, Narendra Modi was Gujarat's chief minister, equivalent of state governor, and many blamed him for doing little or nothing to stop the violence. (In 2005, Modi was even denied a U.S. visa for this reason). Rise of Hindutva What happened in Ayodhya in 1992 was a milestone for Hindutva, or Hindu pride. It's a key element of Modi's vision for India as he runs for reelection this month and next. For Hindu voters who care deeply about Lord Ram's presumed birthplace, step one was destroying the Babri mosque. Step two is building a Hindu temple in its place. The leaders of Modi's BJP say that after three decades, their party is the force most capable of doing that. \"Our party wants a temple to Lord Ram built on that same spot [in Ayodhya] as soon as possible. No doubt about it!\" BJP chief Amit Shah told a party convention in January. Many of India's Hindus, part of the country's majority religion, condemned the 1992 killings and felt discouraged by this horrible bout of sectarian violence. But some hard-liners justified the bloodshed as marking a new beginning \u2014 removing remnants of a Muslim civilization in India and restoring a Hindu one. Modi's party is making those sentiments a priority in a way that the Congress party, which dominated Indian politics since independence, has been unable or unwilling to do. Congress is best known outside India as the party of Mohandas Gandhi, who sought to reconcile Hindus and Muslims with his doctrine of nonviolence. But a former chief minister from the party has individually expressed support for a Ram Mandir. Some Congress lawmakers have sought to boost their Hindu nationalist appeal on other issues, such as by supporting age restrictions for female worshippers at the Sabarimala temple in southern India. But the party has not come to a unified position on Ayodhya. Modi initially promised that construction would begin in his first term, but it hasn't happened. India's Supreme Court now controls the property where the Babri mosque once stood, and judges are hearing petitions on what can be built. Court-appointed mediators are counseling activists on both sides. Some on the far right accuse Modi of dragging his feet. It's similar to the pressure President Trump gets from immigration hard-liners to keep his campaign promise and build a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border. Modi is well aware of the sensitivities. \"Even Narendra Modi, who comes from the Hindu nationalist movement \u2014 that's where he spent his formative years, where he cut his teeth \u2014 is pragmatic to know that you can't shift India too far to the right too quickly,\" says Milan Vaishnav, a senior fellow at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace in Washington, D.C. and director of its South Asia Program. \"If the BJP is brought to power [in the 2019 elections], will they then interpret their mandate as 'OK, now we really have the backing of the people to take on some of these bigger, more controversial hot-button social issues that we have put on the back burner for our first term?' \" Ayodhya today Even though a Ram temple doesn't exist yet in Ayodhya, there's a chief priest in waiting. Satendra Das, 80, with a long, white beard, wears a bright saffron Hindu robe. Back in 1992, while Syed Ikhlaq Latifi watched the destruction of the Babri mosque from his rooftop, Das was on the ground and charged into the melee. Satendra Das, 80, is the chief priest in waiting for the Ram temple, which has not yet been built in Ayodhya.\n                \n                    \n                    Furkan Latif Khan/NPR\n                    \n                \nhide caption Satendra Das, 80, is the chief priest in waiting for the Ram temple, which has not yet been built in Ayodhya. Decades earlier, Hindus had managed to place a small statue of Lord Ram inside the Babri mosque. Mosque leaders acquiesced to its presence. Some Hindus believe that at that moment, the building ceased to be a mosque and was transformed into a Hindu temple by virtue of having an idol inside; Muslims disagree. In early 1992, Das arrived in Ayodhya to work as a caretaker of the statue, so he was allowed to enter the building. In the midst of the destruction, Das ran inside to save the idol. Afterward, he placed it atop the mosque's ruins \u2014 where it still sits today. The rubble has long been carted away, so the idol sits in a dusty lot on a squat wooden scaffold, draped by a blue tarp. To catch a glimpse of it, visitors must pass through a maze of claustrophobia-inducing passageways covered by a roof and enclosed with metal caging \u2014 like long switchback hallways surrounded by metal bars. They pass through metal detectors and turnstiles, surrender their passports or ID cards and are patted down by guards at several checkpoints. Hundreds of police officers patrol the area. Hindu pilgrims \u2014 thousands of them \u2014 shuffle past the idol. They've traveled from all over India. Many are barefoot. One woman is weeping. Someone hands out sweets as an offering to Lord Ram. \"Jai Shree Ram! Jai Siya Ram!\" they chant. \"Long live Lord Ram!\" They are determined to be heard here \u2014 and at this month's polls.

Tens of millions of Hindus took a ritual dip in the Ganges River this winter as part of the largest religious festival in the world \u2014 the Kumbh Mela. For centuries, the festival has been held in various cities in northern India, including Allahabad. But when pilgrims arrived this year for the Kumbh Mela, Allahabad had a different name. Last year, officials from Prime Minister Narendra Modi's Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party changed the name of Allahabad to Prayagraj \u2014 a word that references the Hindu pilgrimage site there. The name Allahabad dated to the 16th century, a legacy of a Muslim ruler, the Mughal Emperor Akbar. \"Today, the BJP government has rectified the mistake made by Akbar,\" a BJP official was quoted as saying when the name was altered.

Last year, the city hosting the festival changed its name from Allahabad to Prayagraj. The name change has set off some bureaucratic confusion: The Allahabad High Court is keeping its name. So is the University of Allahabad. But the city's postmaster says he will soon change the signs outside the Allahabad Post Office to say Prayagraj Post Office \u2014 as well as all the rubber stamps inside. Allahabad's renaming has made headlines not for the hassles of changing signs, but for a growing trend of Hindu nationalism in Indian politics. Over the past five years of Modi's term as prime minister, Hindu nationalist politicians from the BJP have renamed Indian towns, streets, airports and one of the country's biggest train stations, swapping names that reflect Muslim heritage for Hinducentric ones. In doing so, they are revising the map of India and trying to rewrite its history. Hindu devotees bathe in the Ganges River in January at the Kumbh Mela festival in Prayagraj, formerly known as Allahabad.\n                \n                    \n                    Lauren Frayer/NPR\n                    \n                \nhide caption Hindu devotees bathe in the Ganges River in January at the Kumbh Mela festival in Prayagraj, formerly known as Allahabad. Erasing Muslim names A generation ago, long before Modi was in power, right-wing Hindu nationalist leaders in Maharashtra state renamed Bombay as Mumbai \u2014 a nod to the city's patron goddess Mumbadevi. Other cities followed: Madras became Chennai; Calcutta, Kolkata; Bangalore, Bengaluru. All the changes were a rejection of Anglicized names that came into use during British colonial rule. In the most recent wave of name changes, it's not about erasing colonial monikers. It's about erasing Muslim ones. The changes accelerated in 2018, ahead of this year's elections. About 1 in 6 Indians is Muslim. After Hindus, they are the country's biggest faith group. In Allahabad, more than 20% of the city's population is Muslim. Many Muslims trace their lineage back centuries. By changing the city's name, \"It's basically our culture and heritage\" that is eliminated, says Ashraf Ahmed, 30, a Muslim IT business owner who grew up in Allahabad. He still refers to his hometown by that name. \"We've lived for hundreds of years together \u2014 Muslims, Christians, Hindus and others. Many religions belong to India,\" he says, speaking in the shadow of his local mosque. Then his voice drops to a whisper: \"But Muslims are currently facing some problems from this government. It's a little bit tense.\" Ahmed worries that erasing his hometown's Muslim name is a step toward erasing his own family history, his identity \u2014 ultimately disenfranchising India's Muslim citizens. The renaming of Allahabad as Prayagraj, stripping the city of a name rooted in Islam, replaces it with a word that references a Hindu pilgrimage site in the city. But the University of Allahabad is keeping its original name.\n                \n                    \n                    Lauren Frayer/NPR\n                    \n                \nhide caption The renaming of Allahabad as Prayagraj, stripping the city of a name rooted in Islam, replaces it with a word that references a Hindu pilgrimage site in the city. But the University of Allahabad is keeping its original name. The priest-politician The man behind Allahabad's name change and many others is Yogi Adityanath \u2014 a firebrand Hindu priest and chief minister of India's most populous state, Uttar Pradesh. (With more than 200 million residents, the state is bigger than many countries.) Adityanath is a prominent member of Modi's ruling party and the founder of a Hindu youth militia. He has a reputation for inciting hatred against minorities, particularly Muslims. He has frequently railed against Muslims for allegedly committing what he calls \"love jihad\" \u2014 marrying Hindu women. Adityanath is one of India's most vocal Hindu nationalists, seeking to redefine what it means to be Indian. He says the country's majority Hindu faith should be at its center. \"We cannot let Muslim invaders from centuries ago define us today!\" Adityanath told a rally in 2014. Last year, he told reporters that anyone who questions his decisions about renaming Allahabad and other landmarks must not \"know their history, know their traditions, nor have any idea of their rich culture.\" His state is one of many that have banned beef, because cows are sacred to Hindus. It also has the highest number of violent incidents committed by cow vigilantes, who attack Muslims and lower-caste Hindus who trade in beef on the black market. Across 12 Indian states, at least 44 people \u2014 36 of them Muslim \u2014 were killed in cow vigilante violence between May 2015 and December 2018, Human Rights Watch says.

Rewriting history and the \"dumbing-down of higher education\" The name change from Allahabad to Prayagraj has split the history department at the University of Allahabad. \"I was totally aghast!\" says historian Heramb Chaturvedi. BJP politicians \"are trying to polarize,\" he says. \"It is very dangerous for national integrity and unity.\" Chaturvedi opposes the city's name change on two counts: First, he believes the 16th century Mughal Emperor Akbar deserves credit for founding the city of Allahabad. Second, he believes that India, as a pluralistic democracy, should preserve its rich, multifaith history \u2014 and that diversity is its strength. Look around this city, he says. \"You will find typical Mughal architecture, absolutely intact. It's beautiful! We are recognized as the country of Ashoka, of the Buddha and of Gandhi,\" he says. \"And [Hindu nationalists] have never subscribed to this type of inclusiveness.\" But Chaturvedi's supervisor at the university's Medieval and Modern History Department vehemently disagrees. Department head Yogeshwar Tewari calls the city's name change a \"course correction.\" He says for generations, even centuries, the way Indians interpret their own history has been tainted by colonialism and foreign influence. Only now, nearly 72 years after casting off colonial rule, can Indians see their own history clearly, he says. \"Yogi [Adityanath] decided to re-establish our lineage to the past \u2014 our heritage,\" Tewari says. \"Until the 18th century, Muslim rule was here. It was their sway. It was their authority. They decided to impose what they felt was in accordance with their beliefs. But now it's time to celebrate our own.\" By reinterpreting history, Tewari says, India is belatedly celebrating its Hindutva, or Hindu-ness. The push has been led by Modi's BJP. The celebrating can sometimes fly in the face of facts. In January, there was an outcry at the Indian Science Congress after Hindu researchers presented work that dismissed Albert Einstein's theory of relativity as \"a big blunder\" and suggested that ancient Hindu gods invented airplanes and test-tube babies. In this Hinducentric spin on history, some critics see the careful work of Hindu nationalist groups like the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh, where Modi spent his formative years. The BJP is its political arm. The all-male Hindu volunteer corps' stated aim is to promote Hinduism in public life, but it has also stirred hatred toward minorities. \"Research bodies are being packed with RSS people who believe history is Hindu heritage studies, with a purpose to inculcate Hindu pride and warn against enemies of the nation,\" says Tanika Sarkar, a retired professor of history at Jawaharlal Nehru University in New Delhi. \"Whether it's science or history, [they believe] we must talk about ancient Hindu values, Hindu inventions, Hindu science. There's been a general dumbing-down of higher education.\" Shifting legacies As Hindu nationalists reinterpret Indian history, even the country's most revered modern figures are coming under new scrutiny. The once-unassailable legacy of one of Allahabad's most famous native sons \u2014 Jawaharlal Nehru, India's first prime minister \u2014 is now a matter of contention. Nehru, originally from Kashmir, grew up in Allahabad. He wanted India to be a secular, multifaith country. He was a close ally of the freedom leader Mohandas Gandhi. Together they helped write India's Constitution. For decades, Nehru has been almost universally revered as one of India's founding fathers. His daughter and grandson became prime ministers and his great-grandchildren now lead the Indian National Congress, the main party in opposition to Modi's BJP. But his vision has fallen out of favor with those in power. Adityanath recently blamed Nehru for decades of unrest in Kashmir. Modi said in 2013 that another figure should have been India's first prime minister. Some believe even Gandhi's legacy is at risk. In 1948, Gandhi was murdered by a Hindu nationalist, Nathuram Godse, who had once belonged to the RSS. Mughal-influenced architecture is found throughout Prayagraj.\n                \n                    \n                    Lauren Frayer/NPR\n                    \n                \nhide caption Mughal-influenced architecture is found throughout Prayagraj. \"Under the current BJP rule, there have been statues put up to his assassin, Godse,\" Sarkar says. \"India is still known as the land of Gandhi, and they can't jettison him entirely. Gandhi believed the country belongs to all Indians.\" The next generation On weekdays at the Allahabad Public Library \u2014 which has yet to change its name \u2014 there's a gaggle of patriotic 20-somethings studying to be civil servants. \"We always knew this as Allahabad. But to keep our [Hindu] culture alive, they renamed this place,\" says 25-year-old Sarita Jaiswal. \"I agree with this new effort to remap areas and rewrite history. I want to work in government to be part of this.\" If she passes her exams, she'll be part of a new class of civil servants, and they'll not just be renaming Indian cities and landmarks but reinterpreting Indian history through Hindu eyes. The changes they enact may be small. But over time, the consequences may be big. NPR producer Furkan Latif Khan contributed to this report.",

            "article_content": "As India's economy has opened and grown robustly, so has Hindu pride. A lifetime after India cast off colonial rule, it's embracing a new identity and its majority Hindu faith is playing a big part.  DAVID GREENE, HOST: The world's biggest democracy, India, is holding elections right now. Voting actually began earlier this month, and it lasts for five weeks. During these elections, we're looking at a big trend in India. As its economy has opened to the world and grown really robustly, so has Hindu pride. Some call it Hindu nationalism. A lifetime after India cast off colonial rule, it is embracing a new identity, and its majority-Hindu faith is a big part of that. NPR's India correspondent Lauren Frayer joins us now to talk about this theme and also tell us about the story she's going to be bringing us in the coming days. Hi, Lauren. LAUREN FRAYER, BYLINE: Hi there. GREENE: So can I start with a really basic question? What is Hindu nationalism? FRAYER: Sure. So Hinduism is the biggest religion in India. Polytheistic. That means that there are many gods. And it's historically been open to embracing of diversity of traditions. About 80 percent of Indians are Hindus. Now, Hindu nationalism is political. It's the idea that the Hindu faith and culture should shape the state and its policies. And the movement has its roots in the 19th century, in opposition to liberal Hindu reformers, colonialism and Christian missionaries. GREENE: OK. So this is something that started in opposition to something else a long time ago. Why is it on your mind now? Why are we thinking about it? FRAYER: Because Prime Minister Narendra Modi is a Hindu nationalist. He belongs to a Hindu nationalist political party, the Bharatiya Janata Party, or BJP. And he spent his formative years working for this group called the RSS. Some members call it, like, a Hindu version of the Boy Scouts, focusing on values in civic life. But, you know, they also train with weapons and have participated in anti-Muslim riots. Modi is running for a second term, and many see this election as a real turning point for India. Milan Vaishnav, who directs the South Asia Program at the Carnegie Endowment in Washington, D.C., says this election will determine... MILAN VAISHNAV: India's future as a secular republic that embraces pluralism and, you know, kind of adheres to the founders' notion that India's unity is strengthened by its diversity. And over the past five years, we have seen the rise of a Hindu Nationalist Party and the spread of this kind of nationalist ideology. FRAYER: And that ideology is often at odds with the secularism that is enshrined in India's constitution, the whole system that India has really had since independence from Britain in 1947. GREENE: So this is really quite a moment in this country. I mean, it's been secular for - I mean, I'm just doing the math - for, like, 70 or so years. Where's this drive to change that coming from? FRAYER: Right. So let's go back to India's founding - 1947, freedom from the British, India decided to become secular. And here's why. India is so diverse. I mean, there are hundreds of languages, ethnic groups, castes and the founding fathers, among them Mahatma Gandhi and Jawaharlal Nehru, believed that really only a pluralist democracy could hold such diversity together. Hindu nationalists, though, were really miffed. They wanted a Hindu state, and they didn't get it. And it was actually a Hindu nationalist who, less than a year later, assassinated Gandhi. And so Gandhi's death sort of shut down this whole debate, and secularism took hold. And now, a lifetime later, the debate is opening up. India elected a Hindu nationalist, Prime Minister Modi. Right now, like, even secular parties are scrambling to brandish their Hindu nationalist cred because it's just so popular with voters. GREENE: OK. You have a prime minister who's a Hindu nationalist. I mean, Hindu nationalism is now mainstream. This party's been in power for five years. How has India as a country, as a culture, changed? FRAYER: Beef bans, for example. Cows are sacred to Hindus. I can get a hamburger in my Mumbai neighborhood, but it's buffalo meat. Ayurveda is all the rage. That's food, health and beauty products based on ancient Hindu healing traditions. You know, in the U.S., you've got this wellness craze, Gwyneth Paltrow's Goop. Well, here it's a Hindu wellness industry, and it's absolutely booming. The very map of India is changing. Cities and landmarks with Muslim-sounding names - Allahabad, for example, a city in northern India built by Muslim kings in the 16th century, they've changed its name to Prayagraj, a word that refers to a Hindu holy site there. I went to that city, and I spoke with Yogeshwar Tiwari. He's the head of the local university history department. And he calls those Muslim kings invaders who forcibly converted Hindus, and he says now history has to be revised. YOGESHWAR TIWARI: People now certainly feel history has not been presented and narrated and understood in the way that it should have been understood. Every nation goes through course correction. FRAYER: And that makes Indian Muslims pretty uncomfortable. This is their heritage. One in 6 Indians is Muslim. They're a bigger minority than African-Americans are in the U.S. We're talking about 180 million people here. GREENE: So if India moves farther and farther away from the secular past, and Hindu identity really takes hold even more, what does that look like? What are the implications? FRAYER: So some say India could become a Hindu homeland in the way Israel is a homeland for Jews worldwide. In fact, Modi's government has introduced a new citizenship amendment bill that would give Indian citizenship to anybody persecuted in neighboring countries, except if they're Muslim. So India would be using religion as a criteria for citizenship for the first time. Another possible model is Turkey, a secular republic that's seen its majority-Muslim faith brought into public life in a more overt way under Recep Tayyip Erdogan. GREENE: Well, so you're covering an election right now, and this whole conversation seems very central. I mean, it's really a debate about getting to the heart of who India wants to be. And a lot will ride on whether Prime Minister Modi wins this or not. What do you think? What are the polls suggesting? FRAYER: So most observers say he will win, and the question is by how much. And that would really determine his mandate to change the country. But it's not just Modi. Tanika Sarkar is a historian, retired from Jawaharlal Nehru University in New Delhi, and she says Hindu nationals have grown these really deep roots into Indian society. TANIKA SARKAR: They have associations among students, trade unions, retired army people. You know, religion, of course, temples. They have penetrated the everyday lives of Hindus in a very big way. Whether they win the election or lose the election, this work will go on. FRAYER: India's still a young country, 72 years old. It's still really working out who it wants to be. And increasingly, Hindu nationalism is going to be a part of the answer to that. GREENE: Such interesting stuff. Well, you have me interested in this election very much now. I can't wait to follow your stories as you bring them to us later this week. FRAYER: Thanks so much, David. GREENE: Thank you. That's NPR's Lauren Frayer speaking to us this morning from Mumbai.

            "article_content": "One of the ugly by-products of Ukraine's low-level war with Russia is vocal far-right groups of battle-hardened veterans who march the streets of Kiev.  AUDIE CORNISH, HOST: Ukraine heads into the final round of its presidential election on Sunday. Far-right groups have been particularly active this year. Despite their minimal electoral support, the groups and their ultranationalist ideology have a disproportionate influence on Ukraine's national stage. And now they're making ties with other far-right groups across Europe and in the United States. NPR's Lucian Kim reports. LUCIAN KIM, BYLINE: In January last year, hundreds of young men wearing gray-and-black camouflage jackets occupied Kyiv's Independence Square. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) UNIDENTIFIED PERSON: (Speaking Ukrainian). KIM: In a slick YouTube video of the military-style rally, a young man swears to serve the Ukrainian nation for marching with his comrades down Kyiv's main street. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) KIM: This is the National Militia - a far-right organization that claims to enforce law and order but which the U.S. State Department calls a nationalist hate group that targets its political enemies and LGBT activists and the Roma or Gypsy minority. (SOUNDBITE OF BANG) KIM: Last month, before the first round of Ukraine's presidential election, members of the National Militia clashed with police in Kyiv. The militia is an offshoot of the far-right National Corps political party, which grew out of a paramilitary group called Azov. The volunteer Azov Battalion formed in 2014 as a response to the armed Russian-backed insurgency in Eastern Ukraine. And Azov's fighters have often been accused of having neo-Nazi sympathies. (SOUNDBITE OF CAR ALARM SOUNDING) KIM: A few steps from the hustle and bustle of Independence Square, I find a three-story brick building that serves as a base for the National Militia. Olena Semenyaka, a spokeswoman for the National Corps party, says stereotypes about skinheads and soccer hooligans are outdated. OLENA SEMENYAKA: We describe ourselves simply as Ukrainian nationalists. But we also underline that we are nationalists of the new generation. KIM: She says her group is part of a global trend as shown by President Trump's victory in the U.S. and his support for right-wing governments in neighboring Hungary and Poland. SEMENYAKA: After Trump showed his support for right populist governments of Central and Eastern Europe, it has become much easier in terms of political climate for nationalist organizations of this region. KIM: Semenyaka says she's making contacts with right-wing groups abroad, including white nationalists in the U.S. But at home, her party's goal is to get into Parliament, even though the Ukrainian far right polls in the single digits - less than in many Western European countries. KURT VOLKER: Fortunately, they are not a strong or dominant force in Ukraine. KIM: Kurt Volker is a State Department special representative for the country. VOLKER: That is not what defines Ukraine politically or in security terms for the population. KIM: Although the National Militia has only a few thousand members, its ability to mobilize rowdy crowds gives an outsized influence on the national political stage. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) KIM: Lviv in Western Ukraine is a picturesque city with lots of street musicians but also a reputation for being a hotbed of Ukrainian nationalism. In an old apartment building, I meet a polite 25-year-old named Andriy Bondar, the commander of the local National Militia. ANDRIY BONDAR: (Speaking Ukrainian). KIM: Bondar says he'll never forget the adrenaline rush he felt during the first big rally in Kyiv last year. He says members of the National Militia are patriots bringing security to the streets of Ukraine. BONDAR: (Speaking Ukrainian). KIM: He denies the group is neo-Nazi. He says that's just a label to scare children with. But when I leave his office, I notice a small sticker on the door. It shows a blond woman holding a blond baby over the Ukrainian words, preserve your race. It's beautiful. Lucian Kim, NPR News, Lviv, Ukraine. Copyright \u00a9 2019 NPR.  All rights reserved.

Uttar Pradesh, India's most populous state, is led by a Hindu priest and has banned the consumption of beef and changed some city names to reflect Hindu heritage. Indian elections are often called the world's largest exercise in democracy. This month, nearly 900 million voters are eligible to cast ballots in national elections that started Thursday and will continue for more than five weeks. They are deciding whether or not to re-elect Prime Minister Narendra Modi and members of his ruling Bharatiya Janata Party, or BJP. Their votes will also make clear the country's level of support for a growing trend in India's politics: Hindu nationalism. \"The shape of India is at stake,\" says Milan Vaishnav, who directs the South Asia Program at the Carnegie Endowment in Washington, D.C. \"One of the important things this election is going to determine is India's future as a secular republic that embraces pluralism and adheres to the founders' notion that India's unity is strengthened by its diversity.\" Modi's record has been mixed: In his five years in office, India's economy has grown robustly, but unemployment has also risen to a 40-year high. There was an outbreak of violence this winter, when India exchanged airstrikes with its arch-rival and nuclear-armed neighbor, Pakistan. There has also been an elevation of Hindu-centric policy and discourse. Supporters call it Hindu pride, or Hindutva \u2014 Hindu-ness, the feeling of being Hindu. Others call it Hindu nationalism, an ideology of Hindu hegemony \u2014 and a danger to the republic. Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi speaks with of Yogi Adityanath (left), a Hindu priest who is chief minister of Uttar Pradesh, during a campaign rally on March 28.\n                \n                    \n                    Altaf Qadri/AP\n                    \n                \nhide caption Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi speaks with of Yogi Adityanath (left), a Hindu priest who is chief minister of Uttar Pradesh, during a campaign rally on March 28. While Hinduism is India's majority religion (almost 80 percent of Indians are Hindu), Hindu nationalism is political. It's the idea that Hindu faith and culture should help shape the state and its policies \u2014 and it negates the contributions of others. Hindu nationalism has roots in the 19th century, when it emerged as a backlash to the ideas of liberal Hindu reformers, British and Portuguese colonialism and Christian missionaries. It has gained prominence in the late 20th and early 21st centuries, especially under Modi and his Hindu nationalist BJP. But it's often at odds with the secularism enshrined in India's constitution. Many see this election as a turning point in which India may decide to redefine itself according to its majority Hindu faith. Beef bans, politician-monks, new names The last five years under Modi have seen shifts, both gradual and not, as Hindu nationalists have grown increasingly assertive, inserting their priorities into Indian policy, laws and daily life. Minority groups are shunted out or subordinated. As long as the majority is in the ascendency, it doesn't really matter what the conditions for minorities are. Historian Romila Thapa The ideology of a Hindu nationalist group called the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) \u2014 where Modi spent his formative years \u2014 has become especially prominent in recent years. The RSS is an all-male Hindu volunteer corps that says it aims to promote Hinduism in civic life. But its critics accuse it of stirring hatred and violence toward India's minorities. One RSS priority that has become law in several Indian states in recent years is a ban on cow slaughter and the consumption or sale of beef. Hindus consider cows sacred. Police enforce the bans, punishable with up to 10 years in jail in some states or municipal fines in others. India's opposition Congress party leader Sonia Gandhi (center) waves as she arrives to file her nomination papers for elections, in Rae Bareli, Uttar Pradesh, India, on Thursday.

The Congress party dominated Indian politics for much of the country's history but has been overshadowed in recent years by the Hindu nationalist BJP. But self-appointed cow vigilantes \u2014 laypeople, sometimes affiliated with the RSS or BJP \u2014 have also taken it upon themselves to investigate and sometimes attack and even kill people suspected of dealing in beef on the black market. The victims are often Muslims or lower-caste Hindus who traditionally consume and trade in beef and have been deprived of their livelihoods due to the new laws. There's been a rash of mob lynchings targeting those minorities in recent years. Between May 2015 and December 2018, at least 44 people \u2014 36 of them Muslim \u2014 were killed in cow vigilante violence across 12 Indian states, according to Human Rights Watch. Hundreds more have been injured. Meanwhile, Hindu monks and priests have risen to power in politics and business. Baba Ramdev, a monk and yoga guru with close ties to Modi, runs of one of the fastest-growing consumer goods empires in India, selling food, cosmetics and medicine based on ancient Hindu healing traditions. The chief minister of Uttar Pradesh, India's most populous state, with more than 200 million residents, is a Hindu priest. Yogi Adityanath is a prominent member of Modi's party and a vocal Hindu nationalist, infamous for anti-Muslim rhetoric. His state government has enacted a beef ban and renamed cities and landmarks that previously had names rooted in Islam. For example, the city of Allahabad, built in the 16th century by Muslim rulers of the Mughal Empire, was officially renamed last year as Prayagraj, a word that references an earlier Hindu settlement and pilgrimage site there. Hindu nationalists argue that for centuries, British and Mughal dominance influenced how they view their own history \u2014 and they're now finally reinterpreting it through authentic Hindu eyes. Hindu hard-liners, one holding a sword, chant slogans against Muslim communities during a Nov. 25, 2018, rally demanding a Hindu temple be built on a site in Ayodhya, where attackers in 1992 demolished a 16th century mosque.\n                \n                    \n                    Bernat Armangue/AP\n                    \n                \nhide caption Hindu hard-liners, one holding a sword, chant slogans against Muslim communities during a Nov. 25, 2018, rally demanding a Hindu temple be built on a site in Ayodhya, where attackers in 1992 demolished a 16th century mosque. \"India was subjugated under those Muslim rulers. People feel there was some injustice, and history has not been presented and narrated and understood in the way that it should have been understood,\" says Yogeshwar Tewari, head of the history department at Allahabad University (whose name remains unchanged for now). \"Every nation goes through course correction.\" The extent of what Tewari calls \"subjugation\" of Hindus is a question that has divided historians. But for many Indian Hindus, Muslim place names are like Confederate statues in the American South \u2014 reminders of a painful history, some of which are now being removed. During parts of the Mughal era, some Hindu temples were desecrated or destroyed, and for a time, a tax was levied on non-Muslims. Others see the name changes as a dangerous process of erasing the history of an era in which the Mughals united India's disparate kingdoms, codified human rights and left behind some of the country's best-known architecture, including the Taj Mahal. Today, more than 180 million Muslims make up nearly one-sixth of India's population, a bigger proportion of India than African-Americans are in the U.S. \"What is very clear from the kinds of alliances being made for the elections is that the purpose is to consolidate the Hindu vote,\" says historian Romila Thapar, professor emerita at Jawaharlal Nehru University in New Delhi. \"Minority groups are shunted out or subordinated. As long as the majority is in the ascendency, it doesn't really matter what the conditions for minorities are. Fifty years ago, 70 years ago, everyone was equal. Today, it's majoritarianism.\" Shrinking space for secularism That sense of Hindu primacy is squeezing other voices out, Thapar warns. \"As rationalists, we are dismissed because we are told, 'You're not people of faith. You don't understand,'\" she says. \"Now the question is, is politics going to be run by people of faith?\" In 1947, when India won its freedom from British colonial rule, the territory was partitioned into a new Muslim state \u2014 Pakistan \u2014 and a secular, pluralistic state, India. At the time, India's founding fathers \u2014 including the freedom fighter Mohandas Gandhi and Jawaharlal Nehru, who became the country's first prime minister \u2014 concluded that only a pluralistic democracy could hold together India's myriad ethnic groups, languages and castes. Hindu nationalists were outraged. They had lobbied unsuccessfully for a Hindu state, with laws to be shaped by Hindu scripture. They accused Gandhi and Nehru of appeasing minorities by treating them as equals to Hindus under the law. Months later, a Hindu nationalist assassinated Gandhi. Gandhi's death silenced any debate over his and Nehru's vision for a secular India. The RSS, to which Gandhi's assassin belonged, was banned after the murder \u2014 the first of three RSS bans, though all have been overturned and the group remains legal today. Nehru's daughter Indira Gandhi and grandson Rajiv Gandhi went on to become elected prime ministers of India with the Congress party, which has dominated Indian politics for most of the post-independence era. India voted the Hindu nationalist BJP into power briefly in 1996, and then again in 1998 and 2014. If Modi is reelected this spring and serves another full five-year term, his would be the longest streak of non-Congress party rule in modern Indian history. These days, even major secular political parties like the Congress party don't talk about secularism anymore, says Vaishnav. \"One of the most remarkable things about the 2019 election is how little opposition politicians are talking about secularism. It's a four-letter word,\" he says. \"That's something that BJP and its Hindu nationalist allies have succeeded in bringing about.\" The question now is whether Indians voting over the next five weeks will endorse that vision for their country.

Polls say it could win more than 6 percent of the vote in next month's election.  DAVID GREENE, HOST: All right. So Spain used to be one of the few European countries that did not have a far-right party. But then last December, the populist Vox Party won seats in a regional parliament. The main issue fueling this party is nationalism, though, rather than immigration. Lucia Benavides reports. (SOUNDBITE OF FLAMENCO MUSIC) LUCIA BENAVIDES, BYLINE: Even in the dead of winter, Seville is full of sun, tourists and flamenco playing in the streets. (SOUNDBITE OF FLAMENCO MUSIC) BENAVIDES: Life in the Andalusian capital seems to continue as before, despite a change in local politics. This December, the far-right party Vox won 12 parliamentary seats, the first time a right-wing populist party entered mainstream politics since Spain's return to democracy in the late 1970s. Vox now holds legislative power in the populist region. They've promised to cooperate in a coalition government with two conservative parties, Ciudadanos and Partido Popular. (SOUNDBITE OF POLITICAL AD) UNIDENTIFIED NARRATOR: (Speaking Spanish). BENAVIDES: One of Vox's ads ends with the slogan Make Spain Great Again. And they've promised to tighten up control on immigration, limit regional autonomy and repeal Spain's domestic violence law that protects women from their abusers. But despite being around since 2013, the party is just now raising a wave of Spanish nationalism. Juan Lopez, a taxi driver in Seville, says it's a response to the Catalan independence movement. In October 2017, Catalan Separatist leaders seeking more regional autonomy carried out an independence vote, despite the central government calling it illegal. JUAN LOPEZ: (Speaking Spanish). BENAVIDES: Lopez says the Spanish government's lenience towards Catalonia has cost some Spaniards to want a political party that puts its foot down. (SOUNDBITE OF PROTEST) BENAVIDES: On February 9, tens of thousands attended a protest in Spain's capital to demand that the government stop negotiations with Catalan leaders. They called the talks unconstitutional and said the Socialist Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez should step down. Lopez says that's why he sympathizes with Vox. LOPEZ: (Speaking Spanish). BENAVIDES: \"That explains the results in Andalusia,\" he says. \"None of the other parties were taking a strong stance against Catalonia, but Vox was.\" FRANCISCO SERRANO: (Speaking Spanish). BENAVIDES: That's Francisco Serrano, president of Vox in Andalusia. He says his party calls things by their name, and that's what people want. SERRANO: (Through interpreter) What's happening in Catalonia is an attempted coup, a sedition, a rebellion, by people who want to break the unity of Spain. BENAVIDES: Javier Garcia of the left-wing Participa Sevilla says the main narratives heard in the Andalusia campaign were national issues, like Catalan independence, immigration and feminism, rather than the day-to-day struggles of the region's residents. JAVIER GARCIA: (Through interpreter) That constant bombardment of information eventually has an effect on people. We're seeing a political competition between the three right-wing parties. BENAVIDES: All three of those leaders spoke side by side at the February protests in Madrid, a sign that Vox is beginning to be accepted by Spain's conservative politicians. Less than a week later, Sanchez announced he'd call for snap elections on April 28 after failing to pass his budget plan. Polls say Vox could win more than 6 percent of the vote in a national election. Together, with the two other conservative parties, which polled at 17 and 15 percent, Spain's right-wing parties could form a large enough coalition to govern.

Gomez, 67, has been the archbishop of Los Angeles, the largest Roman Catholic diocese in the U.S., for most of the past decade. His previous posts include stints in Denver and San Antonio, Texas. The election to @USCCB president is an honor \u2014 not only for me, but also for @lacatholics and for every Latino Catholic in the country.

DiNardo, who is the archbishop of Galveston-Houston. Gomez's term officially begins Wednesday, when the USCCB concludes its general assembly in Baltimore. He has served as the body's vice president since November 2016 \u2014 a post that was set to expire under the group's standard three-year terms. After receiving 176 votes to become the next @USCCB president, the US bishops give @ArchbishopGomez a standing ovation pic.twitter.com/eeXq9UH1qu In addition to making history as the conference of bishops' first Latino leader, Gomez is also \"the first bishop elected to lead the conference to be associated with Opus Dei,\" according to the Catholic News Agency. Gomez joined Opus Dei while he was in college, the USCCB says. The future archbishop studied theology in Spain \u2014 the historic home of Opus Dei \u2014 and he was ordained a priest of Opus Dei in 1978, several years before the group gained the status of a personal prelature in the Catholic Church. Within the Catholic Church, Gomez is seen as a bridge between its conservative-liberal divide, according to The Rev. Allan Figueroa Deck of Loyola Marymount University. \"He's very focused on the kinds of issues that are vital to the Latino community,\" Deck tells KPCC reporter Aaron Schrank in Los Angeles. \"On the one hand, a community that's more traditional than some other groups in the Catholic Church \u2014 but also one that has very serious social, economic and political issues that need to be fought.\" A native of Monterrey, Mexico, Gomez became a U.S. citizen in 1995. And while he attended to his duties at the general assembly in Maryland this week, he also issued tweets in support of immigrants on Monday, saying he was praying for a good outcome in the Supreme Court, where justices will decide a case involving the legal status of some 700,000 young immigrants. \"In a special way, I pray for #DREAMERS, the day before #SCOTUS hears oral arguments on the legality of DACA,\" Gomez said. The USCCB has filed a friend-of-the-court brief in the case. And on Tuesday, it issued a statement from Bishop Joe S.

We continue to urge Congress and the President to work together to find a permanent legislative solution to the plight of all DREAMers, including DACA beneficiaries.\" In recent years, Gomez has also spoken out to condemn racism and violence after events like the 2015 attack on a church in Charleston, S.C., and the attack on counterprotesters at a white nationalist rally in Charlottesville, Va. \"There is no place in the Church and in American society for racism; for prejudice against people based on their race or nationality,\" Gomez wrote in one tweet after the Charlottesville rally. In response to the El Paso, Texas, attack that targeted Latino shoppers at a Walmart in August, Gomez wrote an essay for Angelus News in which he said, \"With El Paso a line has been crossed in our nation.\" \"If 'white nationalism' is on the rise,\" Gomez wrote, \"it is a sign of how far we have fallen from the Christian universalism of our nation's founding ideals.\" The USCCB's incoming president also is the author of several books, including a 2013 book about migration titled Immigration and the Next America: Renewing the Soul of Our Nation.",

When Christopher Wylie first began working for the British behavioral research company SCL Group, the company used data drawn from a number of sources as a means of potentially altering outcomes for its, sometimes military, clients. But over time, Wylie's mission \u2014 and that of the company \u2014 expanded. Conservative strategist Steve Bannon, who later worked in President Trump's White House, became involved with the SCL subsidiary Cambridge Analytica. Wylie, who served as Cambridge Analytica's research director for a year and a half, watched as his group began to use of data from Facebook and other online sources to target users for disinformation campaigns. \"They targeted people who were more prone to conspiratorial thinking,\" Wylie says. \"They used that data, and they used social media more broadly, to first identify those people, and then engage those people, and really begin to craft what, in my view, was an insurgency in the United States.\" Wylie adds: \"The things that I was building on originally for the defense of our democracies had been completely inverted to really, in my view, attack our democracies.\" In 2014, Wylie resigned from Cambridge Analytica. He later became a whistleblower, exposing the company's role in President Trump's presidential campaign and Brexit. He also revealed the company's links to Russia. Wylie's new book, Mindf*ck, explains how Cambridge Analytica harvested the information of tens of millions of Facebook users, then used the data to target people susceptible to disinformation, racist thinking and conspiracy theories. Though Cambridge Analytica no longer exists, Wylie warns that the company's tactics continue to be a threat to democracy. He notes that some of its former employees are currently working on the next Trump campaign. \"One of the reasons I wrote the book is to serve as a warning, particularly to Americans,\" he says. \"We have a completely unregulated digital landscape. There is almost no oversight. We are placing blind trust in companies like Facebook to do the honorable and decent thing. ... Even if Cambridge Analytica doesn't exist anymore, what happens when China becomes the next Cambridge Analytica?\" On the research Wylie initially did for SCL I got recruited to join a research team at SCL group which, at the time, was a British military contractor based in London. Most of its clients were various ministries of defense in NATO countries. And what we were looking at is how to use data online to identify people who would be likely targets of different extremist groups. And from that, try to understand and unpack: How would a fairly extreme ideological message spread through different kinds of social networks? And what could we do in order to mitigate its effectiveness? When Steve Bannon got introduced to the company, he realized that a lot of that work could be inverted. And rather than trying to mitigate an extremist insurgency in certain parts of the world, he wanted to essentially catalyze one in the United States. When Steve Bannon got introduced to the company, he realized that a lot of that work could be inverted. And rather than trying to mitigate an extremist insurgency in certain parts of the world, he wanted to essentially catalyze one in the United States. Christopher Wylie On Steve Bannon's role in Cambridge Analytica He found us in London. He convinced a billionaire [Robert Mercer] to acquire the company, and then he transformed that company into a set of tools that he would be able to use to, in effect, manipulate a certain segment of the American voter population. When Steve Bannon took over, he wasn't just concerned about particular elections. He followed this notion of the Breitbart doctrine, which is that politics exists downstream from culture. So don't just focus on the day-to-day politics. Try to actually make an impact on an enduring change in culture, because politics will just flow from that. On how SCL and Cambridge Analytica approached personality profiling Cambridge Analytica and the Plot to Break America by Random House Hardcover, 269 pages | Your purchase helps support NPR programming. How? Originally, when we were looking at this for defense purposes, we wanted to figure out ... what were the psychological characteristics of those people that would make them more prone and more vulnerable to certain kinds of [extremist] messaging, so that we could engage them beforehand? That was based on a series of studies, many of which came out of the University of Cambridge, that looked at essentially how, particularly with Facebook data, you can quite accurately predict a person's personality profile. And from that, if you can understand how a person thinks and feels and engages in the world, and what kinds of biases they have, you can then figure out what's going to be most effective at engaging them in a particular objective \u2014 originally in some kind of counter-extremism or mitigation strategy. Later, when it became Cambridge Analytica, it essentially became identifying people in the same way that you'd be looking for people who'd be more vulnerable to ISIS messaging \u2014 people who were more prone to conspiratorial thinking or paranoid ideation. Effectively, it looks for the same kinds of people. But rather than discouraging them from joining ISIS, it would be to encourage them to join the alt-right. On how Cambridge Analytica collected data When the story blew up, one of the things that people often talked about is how it was a hack of Facebook, or some kind of data breach. And what actually happened was that Facebook authorized the applications that Cambridge Analytica ended up using to access the data. The company engaged professors at the University of Cambridge to create an application that then got put onto Facebook where people would go and fill out personality inventories, like surveys about who they are and their attributes. But the way the app worked was that they wouldn't just harvest the data of the person who responded to that survey, but it would go into their profile and look at all of their friends and harvest all of their friends' data as well. So when you had one person fill out a survey, by default they effectively consented by proxy for hundreds of other people, simply because they were Facebook friends with them. So that scaled really quickly. And at the time, the way Facebook worked, they allowed applications to have that feature. They've since turned it off, and rightfully so, but at the time, you could acquire a lot of data really quickly. On why people filled out the surveys that Cambridge Analytica used to harvest data Different kinds of people have different motivations for filling out surveys. Sometimes you would have a group of people who just would fill it out because they're bored, and they don't have anything to do. Or they would just genuinely want to know what is their personality. Or if you had apps that were, \"If you were on 'Game of Thrones,' who would be your character? Fill out this survey, and find out.\" Little do they know that actually it's taking all of that information and porting it over to an alt-right campaign. But in some cases with certain groups of people that were underrepresented in those samples, they would be paid one dollar, two dollars, around there, to fill out a survey. And people do a lot for a dollar, which is actually quite surprising. On his decision to resign from Cambridge Analytica It was a gradual process, sort of like boiling a frog in a way. Things change and you don't necessarily notice how much things have changed when you're inside of something. ... But really, one of the things that I remember is seeing videos of people from focus groups and events that Cambridge Analytica was doing who had been targeted and sort of massaged online into believing certain kinds of conspiracies. And just to see like the rage in their eyes \u2014 how angry these people were, how they started engaging in highly racialized thinking. ... To see their faces and what that looks like, what a manipulated person looks like, for me, it was really eye-opening. Sam Briger and Joel Wolfram produced and edited this interview for broadcast.

When Martin Luther King Jr. visited the villa in Mumbai, India, where Mohandas Gandhi stayed in the 1920s, he had a special request: He wanted to spend the night in Gandhi's bedroom. It was 1959, 11 years after Gandhi's death. The house, called Mani Bhavan, where the Indian leader taught followers to spin their own fabric and where he launched satyagraha \u2014 his movement for truth and nonviolent resistance \u2014 had been converted into a museum. In an austere top-floor room where Gandhi's mattress and shoes still lay, King said he could feel \"vibrations\" of the Mahatma, or great soul. \"[King] was booked in a very good hotel. But he said, 'I am not going anywhere else. I am going to stay here, because I am getting vibrations of Gandhi,' \" recalls curator Usha Thakkar. So curators hauled in two cots, and the American civil rights leader and his wife, Coretta Scott King, spent the night next to Gandhi's vacant mattress. Afterward, Martin Luther King told All India Radio that he'd decided to adopt Gandhi's method of civil disobedience as his own.

Now, six decades later, many black Africans are calling Gandhi a racist. #MeToo activists are questioning his sexual practices. Hindu nationalists are rejecting Gandhi's vision of a pluralistic India that is strengthened by diversity. Gandhi is still revered. He helped win India freedom from British colonial rule in 1947. But as the world marks what would be his 150th birthday on Wednesday, some of his habits and teachings are facing fresh scrutiny. Gandhi was a racist Last year, a Gandhi statue was removed from a university campus in Ghana. Activists there and in Malawi are using the hashtag #GandhiMustFall. They're angry about his early writings. In 1903, when Gandhi was in South Africa, he wrote that white people there should be \"the predominating race.\" He also said black people \"are troublesome, very dirty and live like animals.\" There's no way around it: Gandhi was a racist early in his life, says his biographer Ramachandra Guha. \"Gandhi as a young man went with the ideas of his culture and his time. He thought in his 20s that Europeans are the most civilized. Indians were almost as civilized, and Africans were uncivilized,\" Guha, 61, told NPR in an interview in May at his home in Bengaluru, India. \"However, he outgrew his racism quite decisively, and for most of his life as a public figure, he was an anti-racist, talking for an end to discrimination of all kinds,\" he said. That included gender discrimination. Gandhi championed women in politics. But he was also obsessed with his own celibacy. In his late 70s, before he died at 78, he slept naked with his grandniece when she was in her late teens. He said he wanted to test his willpower to abstain from sex. Nowadays, most people would call that abuse. Some question whether the young female was capable of giving consent as a minor to a man who was so revered and so much more powerful than she. In 1962, when British filmmaker Richard Attenborough began researching what would become his 1982 Gandhi film, he asked Jawaharlal Nehru, India's first prime minister, how he should portray his late colleague. Nehru famously replied that Gandhi was \"a great man, but he had his weaknesses, his moods and his failings.\" He begged Attenborough not to turn Gandhi into a saint. He was \"much too human,\" Nehru said. Father of the nation In India, Gandhi is nevertheless treated as a saint \u2014 the father of the nation. His birthday, Oct. 2, is a national holiday. Gandhi's face is on India's currency. His portrait hangs in government offices. Practically every major city in the country has at least one Gandhi memorial. At the garden in New Delhi where he was assassinated in 1948, just months after India's independence from Britain, tourists can stroll the stone walkway where Gandhi took his final steps. \"When people come here, they get highly emotional. Some of them have tears in their eyes and go back with a heavy heart,\" says researcher Sailaja Gullapalli, giving NPR a tour.

Across India, schools are holding special assemblies and singing the freedom leader's favorite prayer songs. There are trash collection drives and a mass fabric-spinning session at the Mahatma's old Mumbai villa. But India is also where the Mahatma may have fallen furthest from the pedestal.

Hindu nationalists in power The man who assassinated Gandhi, Nathuram Godse, was a follower of Hindutva \u2014 Hindu nationalism. Godse wanted India to be a Hindu country and objected to Gandhi's vision of India as a secular, pluralistic democracy. (India is about 80% Hindu but also has one of the world's largest Muslim populations, making up about 14% of the country, or around 180 million people.) \"The Hindutva type of ideology considered [Gandhi] to be an enemy because he was talking of secularism and not of Hinduism,\" says Yogesh Kamdar, honorary secretary of the Mani Bhavan museum and the son of Indian freedom fighters. Gandhi's vision won. When colonial India was partitioned in 1947, Hindu-majority India became a secular democracy, alongside the Islamic Republic of Pakistan. But Hindu nationalists are now in power in India. Some of them still don't accept Gandhi's vision. Like Godse, they want India to be a Hindu country. Some extremists among them even celebrate Gandhi's murder. Members of a far-right Hindu group, the Akhil Bharat Hindu Mahasabha, shot and burned Gandhi's effigy on his death anniversary this year. In May, a parliamentary candidate from Prime Minister Narendra Modi's mainstream Bharatiya Janata Party called Gandhi's assassin, Godse, a \"patriot.\" That shocked the country. The candidate, Pragya Thakur, was forced to apologize \u2014 but nevertheless won her election. She is now a member of Parliament representing the central Indian city of Bhopal. Thakur is an outlier though. Most Indian politicians admire Gandhi, and even those who don't have to tread very carefully. \"Very grudgingly, and maybe as a part of strategy, they have also adopted Gandhi as an icon. They had to!\" says Kamdar. \"Otherwise it is very difficult to survive politically.\" Modi is headlining events for the 150th anniversary. The Mahatma's signature round spectacles are the logo for Modi's Clean India campaign \u2014 a national sanitation effort inspired by Gandhi. Gandhi's philosophy On weekends, crowds throng a park in New Delhi to pay their respects at the spot where Gandhi was cremated, called Raj Ghat. There's a long black marble slab covered in marigolds and topped with an eternal flame. The memorial inspires reverence, and also a few whispered debates about the Mahatma's legacy. \"It's gone nowadays. It's really gone,\" tourist Ira Parikh, 44, says of Gandhi's swadeshi movement \u2014 the idea that Indians should spin their own cloth and work in simple local industries. \"Few [people] are following these things anymore. I don't think it's practical.\" Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi pays homage at Raj Ghat, the memorial for Gandhi in New Delhi, on Martyr's Day on Jan. 30, 2018, to mark the 70th anniversary of Gandhi's assassination.\n                \n                    \n                    Money Sharma/AFP/Getty Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi pays homage at Raj Ghat, the memorial for Gandhi in New Delhi, on Martyr's Day on Jan. 30, 2018, to mark the 70th anniversary of Gandhi's assassination. Parikh says the historical figure's ideas can seem a bit quaint in booming, globalized India. Her two sons learn about him in school, but one of them says he struggles to see how those lessons apply to his own life. \"When someone says, 'Oh, he was great,' there's always some criticism,\" says Harsh Parikh, 17, recounting debates with friends about Gandhi's tactics. \"Like, 'No, he could have got us freedom way before' [if he had been willing to use violence].\" What these teenagers are weighing is at the very heart of Gandhian philosophy: \"His absolute insistence on nonviolence, which young men see as pussyfooted and weak-kneed and \u2014 dare I say \u2014 feminine and hence not macho enough,\" says Guha, the biographer. Gandhi's restraint can look naive in today's India, confronted with terrorism. Modi has sought to portray himself as a strong pair of hands who isn't afraid to strike at neighboring Pakistan if provoked. (Both countries have nuclear weapons.) \"Palace of cards\" At the other memorial across New Delhi, in the garden where Gandhi was shot dead, a 76-year-old man sits with a spinning wheel.

Wednesday marks 150 years since the birth of Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi. Better known as the Mahatma, or great soul, Gandhi was an Indian lawyer who led his country to freedom from British colonial rule in 1947. He was assassinated months later at age 78. Gandhi is most famous for his philosophy of nonviolence that has inspired civil rights leaders around the world. But his legacy is facing fresh scrutiny against modern ideas about race, feminism and nationalism. Ramachandra Guha is a historian of modern India. He is the author of many books, including the two-volume biography Gandhi Before India and Gandhi: The Years That Changed the World, 1914-1948. Guha, 61, spoke with NPR at his home in Bengaluru, India, in May. The interview has been edited and condensed. On how Gandhi's legacy has changed since he died He is an object of intense debate and argument among Indians, in a way in which the Chinese don't really debate about Mao [Zedong], or the Vietnamese don't really debate about Ho Chi Minh \u2014 or indeed the Pakistanis don't really debate about [founder of Pakistan Muhammad Ali] Jinnah. One aspect of the disquiet with Gandhi is on his views on religious pluralism. Hindu fundamentalists do not like it \u2014 particularly his ideas of interfaith harmony and his absolute insistence that India is [a secular state rather than a religious one] like Pakistan. [That] is not something they can easily accept. It goes contrary to their ethos. Mahatma Gandhi (Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi, 1869-1948), Indian nationalist and spiritual leader, leading the Salt March in protest against the government monopoly on salt production.\n                \n                    \n                    Central Press/Getty Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption Mahatma Gandhi (Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi, 1869-1948), Indian nationalist and spiritual leader, leading the Salt March in protest against the government monopoly on salt production. A second aspect is his absolute insistence on nonviolence, which young men see as pussy-footed and weak-kneed and \u2014 dare I say, feminine \u2014 and hence not macho enough. There is a growing revisionist historiography which suggests that if India had adopted the path of violent revolution, independence from the British would have come quicker. A third aspect of disquiet with Gandhi is his advocacy of the simple life, which does not gel well with the acquisitive, materialistic and rapidly growing industrializing society. He recognized that unbridled consumerism would destroy the world. Now, that is not something that goes well with a shortsighted kind of market-oriented economy that we have today. On what Gandhi would think of India now I don't think he would have been utterly despairing of India today. He would have welcomed the delegitimizing of \"untouchability\" [the idea that people born into India's lowest caste are unclean and should be segregated]. He would have welcomed the spirit of entrepreneurship of young Indians and the fact that we've had 17 successive free elections. Gandhi as a young lawyer.\n                \n                    \n                    Hulton Archive/Getty Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption Gandhi as a young lawyer. At the same time, there's the arrogance of our political leaders, the lack of respect for the elementary courtesies of public debate, the environmental degradation rampant across India, corruption and criminality, violence against women. He would have given India a mixed report card. On how the world sees Gandhi His ideas of interfaith harmony, environmental sustainability, nonviolence \u2014 these are ideas that are enduring and universal. After the first volume of my Gandhi biography came out in 2013, I was in a New York hotel promoting it. The book was on my table and someone from housekeeping came in to clean my room and saw it. He didn't know it was my book. He said, \"That's the young Mr. Gandhi, isn't it?\" So, this person was able to recognize Gandhi in a lawyer's suit, as a young lawyer. He said, \"He's greatly admired in my country.\" And I ask this gentleman of the hotel staff, \"What is your country?\" The answer was the Dominican Republic. Now, I'm absolutely certain Gandhi had not heard of the Dominican Republic! But the Dominican Republic had heard of Gandhi. So that's it: Gandhi does not belong to India. Even if we Indians throw him out or discard him or disregard him, there will be people elsewhere in the world, with whom his ideas and legacy will resonate. On controversies around Gandhi The record is very clear: He was racist [against black Africans] when he was young [and working as a lawyer in South Africa]. By the time he reached his 30s, he was outgrowing his racism, and for the last 35 years of his public life, he was advocating absolute equality for all people. Gandhi was also obsessed with his own sexuality and celibacy, which is hugely problematic. He was doing these experiments to test his celibacy. [In his late 70s, Gandhi slept naked in the same bed as his teenage grand-niece.] He wanted to make sure he was not a sexual predator. Those experiments cannot be defended. They were an imposition on young people and an exercise in power, because he is the great Mahatma and she's just a young follower. Like many men of his time, he felt women must bear the primary burden of [household chores and child-rearing]. Gandhi's views on women's rights certainly fall short of what a contemporary, 21st century sensibility would expect. At the same time, in the 1920s and '30s, to bring women into public life \u2014 to encourage them to become ministers, parliamentarians [as Gandhi did] \u2014 was certainly, I think, quite revolutionary. On how to balance respect and criticism for the political and spiritual leader Ultimately, for all the disagreements you have with Gandhi, there's his moral and physical courage, his willingness to lay his life on the line, his ability to encourage a sense of debate and dialogue. Even with those with whom he profoundly disagreed, he kept up a conversation over decades. These are aspects that compel admiration. Not unqualified adulation, not reverence \u2014 but qualified respect. It's an acknowledgment that he made mistakes, that he could be shortsighted, that he could sometimes be patronizing towards young people and towards women. But he was one of many major figures in the Indian renaissance. On what other aspects Gandhi should be known for His sense of humor, his ability to mock himself, the transparency of his public life \u2014 the fact that he was a wonderfully clear and fine writer. I mean, it's a joy to engage with his writings because he said everything clearly and directly with no obfuscation or jargon. He had a great and deep and uncanny understanding of the linguistic diversity of India. I think Americans are too obsessed with English being a unifier. If one county in Texas or California becomes Spanish-dominant, some Americans think national unity is attacked. So [Gandhi would say that] to be a patriot doesn't require you to speak a certain language. That's the glory of the human race. There's so much diversity. I think that's another aspect of Gandhi's heritage that in America is not that well known.",

            "article_content": "Marian Anderson's story reveals a longstanding legacy of black women amplifying black women's perspectives through the politics of concert performance.\n                \n                    \n                    Michael Ochs Archives/Getty Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption Marian Anderson's story reveals a longstanding legacy of black women amplifying black women's perspectives through the politics of concert performance. \"When will we listen to black women?\" This has been the crescendoing, rallying cry echoed throughout the streets, in journalistic thinkpieces and on social media, escalating in the wake of the 2016 presidential and 2017 Alabama senatorial elections that revealed black women's collective voting power in arguably the most contentious political contests in the 21st century thus far. According to journalist Steven W. Thrasher, writing in the New York Review of Books, black women have dominated the resistance in electoral politics: \"Unlike a majority of white women on election day 2016, some 94% of black women voted for Hillary Clinton\u2014the largest concentration of any demographic to go for any candidate in the presidential election.\" We are in an era of movements founded by black women, such as #BlackLivesMatter, #MeToo, and #SayHerName, and some even use messianic language to characterize those women as \"saving the day\" through their collective action. This recent surge in direct action represents a lineage of black women lifting their voices for themselves that has its historical antecedent in demonstrations such as Marian Anderson elevating Florence Price's composition in her most notable recital at the Lincoln Memorial. Throughout history, black women have demonstrated independence and ingenuity in creating spaces for themselves and for one another in quotidian life and in musical performance, lifting their performative and civil voices. As the antebellum women's rights movement grew in the late 19th century, African American women perceived their political isolation and \"began to re-imagine and implement new strategies anchored in strategic performance of black femininity in public acts of protest,\" according to Treva Lindsey, author of Colored No More: Reinventing Black Womanhood in D.C. They have also viewed personal access as an opportunity for the entire community to enter new spheres of influence with them. Philadelphian contralto Marian Anderson's story reveals a longstanding legacy of black women amplifying black women's perspectives through the politics of concert performance. After having sung for dignitaries around the world, in 1939 Anderson was famously refused desegregated concert space at Washington D.C.'s Constitution Hall, due to its owners, the Daughters of the American Revolution, choosing to enforce a lax city segregated-audience policy. She eventually accepted an invitation from Howard University, the host of the concert, as well as First Lady Eleanor Roosevelt to perform at the Lincoln Memorial before 75,000 people on Resurrection Sunday. More importantly, Anderson closed the recital with an arranged composition of the Negro spiritual \"My Soul Is Anchored in the Lord\" by Florence B. Price. Unlike the male composers on the printed recital program, including her friends Harry T. Burleigh and Edward Boatner, Price's name is listed in full, revealing her gender. She was also listed last, suggesting that she was one \"to watch,\" while simultaneously positioning Anderson as an impresario of black women's new works. This strategy of sharing the stage and radio broadcast constitutes a collaboration that can be described by Alice Walker's womanism: a black feminism \"that prefers \"women's culture, women's emotional flexibility (values tears as natural counterbalance of laughter), and women's strength... [is] committed to survival and wholeness of entire people, male and female.\" This concert was a pivotal event that is continually revisited by scholars and artists such as, most recently, the conductor, composer, and Howard University alumnus Damien Sneed in his new chamber opera Marian's Song,set to debut at the Houston Grand Opera in 2020. The significance of the collaboration between Anderson and Price has been overlooked until recently, due in part to a revival and retrieval of Florence B. Price's compositions. The film The Caged Bird: The Life and Music of Florence B. Price places the apex of Price's career in 1933, when her Symphony in E minor was premiered by the all-white male orchestra at the Chicago Symphony, under the baton of Frederick A. Stock. That revealed a white male-centered bias privileging the grand lineage of symphonies in E minor, which includes Antonin Dvorak's 1893 \"New World Symphony\" \u2014 a work that drew heavily from Negro spirituals. However, I am inclined to move away from proving Price's proximity to Great White Male Composers as her life's goal and career highlight. It took self-awareness for her to program Negro spirituals for the 1939 recital, in spite of the white dominant culture's ridicule of programming black folk repertoires for the concert stage. That derision was based in the Eurocentrism that is prized in formal music education to this day. Price used African American folk idioms to illustrate her multiple-consciousness identity that embraced what English and Africana studies scholar Salamishah Tillet refers to, in her book Sites of Slavery: Citizenship and Racial Democracy in the Post-Civil Rights Imagination, as an African American \"critical patriotism\" championed by black women suffragist leaders such as Mary Church Terrell. Black composers collaborating with concert musicians and setting folk musics for concert performance was a political strategy to express black nationalism. The Martin Luther King, Jr. Research and Education Institute at Stanford University sets forth that \"proponents of black nationalism advocated economic self-sufficiency, race pride for African Americans, and black separatism\" to navigate anti-black structures. In musicologist Samuel A. Floyd, Jr.'s research on Harlem Renaissance musicians, he wrote, \"...it was in the realm of concert music that [Harlem] Renaissance thinkers hoped for great achievement, expecting that black folk music would serve as the basis for great symphonic compositions that would be performed by accomplished black musicians... [Musicologist] Eileen Southern has most appropriately identified as black nationalist composers such figures as Harry T. Burleigh, Clarence Cameron White, Robert Nathaniel Dett, Harry Lawrence Freeman, Florence Price, J. Harold Brown, and William Levi Dawson, writing that all 'consciously turned to the folk music of their people as a source of inspiration for their compositions...'\" In the spirit of critical patriotism, several individuals and black organizations made that 1939 recital possible through unmarked, free labor. Sustained by a web of black women-inclusive networks \u2014 black churches, black women's clubs, Howard University, the NAACP and the National Association for Negro Musicians \u2014 Anderson ascended the stage voicing Florence B. Price's composition as the \"final say\" on that landmark moment. The NANM is particularly important. Price met Anderson in the 1930s, and both women became deeply entrenched in a network of black women artisans. They found refuge, exposure, and collaborative partners in black musician's guilds such as the NANM. Public music education provided by guilds have long been a culturally relevant means through which talented African Americans could pursue training, and the NANM, founded in Chicago in 1919, is the country's oldest organization dedicated to the preservation, encouragement and advocacy of all genres of the music of African Americans. Price went on to tailor fifty art songs and arrangements for Anderson and in fact, following that Lincoln Memorial recital, Anderson often closed her recitals with \"My Soul's Been Anchored in the Lord,\" establishing it as her signature piece. Sonically, Anderson's contralto fach (German for one's vocal classification) signified on the rare vocal range and warm, velvety timbral qualities that are celebrated in the aesthetics of black vocality. Imagined to be the sonic domain of men, her contralto vocal range traversed the lower treble to bass timbral realms. The lyrics of Price's arrangement were choice commentary on the undisputed significance of the moment: emphasizing God's steadfastness, community, and black sisterhood. \"My Soul's Been Anchored in the Lord\" conveys piety; however, upon closer inspection of the context we find musical signifyin(g) \u2014 an African-American rhetorical device used to artfully critique a person, entity, or situation. Using the folk Negro spiritual, Price tailored for Anderson a witty remark upon the moment that only one she can count on is God, echoing the wisdom of Harriet Tubman, who once reportedly said, \"Oh, dear Lord, I ain't got no friend but you.\" Visually and musically, Anderson was deployed as an inter- and intracultural tool. Interculturally, the way she held herself onstage was an embodiment of being anchored: imagery consistent with stillness and rootedness, quietude of the body indicative of both ladyhood and the proper, Eurocentric concert stance of a vocalist trained to sing without amplification. Intraculturally, Anderson looked like black ladyhood at the 1939 recital: her hair neatly finger-waved and pinned into place, the chromatic colors of her attire complete with a brown mink fur coat and matching hat. The fur coat in particular is a multi-referent to black ladyhood, achievement, and posterity emblematic of what journalist Lolly Bowean called \"a rarely recognized ritual in the African-American community, one in which older black women pass their expensive coats on to younger women in their family and friendship circles as a gentle way to affirm the younger woman's elegance and grace... In a way, passing down a fur coat is a modest gesture to prophesize a life of opulence and grandeur for a younger woman...\" Bowean interviewed cultural critic and professor Tanisha C. Ford, who attests \"At a time when segregation was still the law of the land, and de facto the law onward, for a black woman to walk outside her house in something that was as luxurious and glamorous and that was normally designated for a white woman \u2014 it was a big deal.\" In fact, several divas who have been interviewed about Anderson's impact, including Marian Anderson Prize winner Denyce Graves, have attested to the fact that she regularly gave her garments to them as an investment in their promise as cultural ambassadors. Through visual and musical performance, Anderson performed the communal goals of what Tillet calls \"shared responsibility\" and \"collective freedom\". Much evidence of Anderson's practice of musical sisterhood can be found in the Marian Anderson papers in the University of Pennsylvania library, where one can find her correspondence with many women composers, including Price's letter in 1937 referring to plans for orchestrating \"My Soul's Been Anchored in the Lord.\" An enclosed Western Union receipt indicates Anderson's plans to record the song. In the online summary of Anderson's papers housed at the University of Pennsylvania's Kislak Center, librarian Margaret Kruesi documents that \"approximately a third of the composers who sent manuscripts to Anderson for her consideration were women.\" The volume of women's composition in her collection proves that Anderson's impact was more than as a culture bearer. She opened up black women's musical possibilities to being programmed internationally, where doors had been shut by the dominant gatekeepers. Anderson used her sounded voice to claim the sociopolitical and mass-mediated soundscape in the public sphere. Among the black elite, Anderson and Price's approaches were emblematic of what activist and educator Nannie Helen Burroughs wrote of in the NAACP magazine The Crisis, in 1915, describing the liberality and praise that arises when black women are permitted to lift their civil voice: \"When Black women get the vote, it will find her a tower of strength of which poets have never sung, orators have never spoken and scholars have never written.\" Since the inception of the US women's suffrage movement, black women's myriad perspectives have been systematically excluded from the agenda. With her Lincoln Memorial performance, leading lady Anderson set the stage and took the lead for African American women to reject white women's unsisterly role in erecting barriers to black women's full experience of free womanhood: the D.A.R.'s refutation of black women's eligibility as descendants of people who died for this country in the American Revolution and beyond; white women's dissociation with black women's ladyhood in broader society, and particularly white women suffragists' willful obliviousness to black women's lack of access to full rights of citizenship that included voting rights, desegregated education, and desegregated patronage of performance venues like Constitution Hall. In popular accounts of that recital, much attention has been given to Eleanor Roosevelt's resignation from the D.A.R. after its rejection of Anderson; however, it is lesser known that her resignation was almost two months after Anderson was not permitted to perform in the venue to a desegregated audience. Viewing Roosevelt as \"the lady white savior\" incorrectly places her at the center of the triumph, when she was actually late to the show. On the contrary, at the center of the triumph was the extent to which Anderson utilized the 1939 Resurrection Day recital to exhibit the musical fraternal and sororal bonds that contributed to her ascent to world-class notoriety. As Anderson envoiced Price's composition in particular, she provided a musical rebuttal to the concert domains that predominantly comprised white male decision makers, an exclusionist industry bolstered by unsisterly white women patrons that stemmed from a joint colonial past of chattel slavery plantation hierarchy. And these are barriers that African American women still face in the concert music industry and in their homes today. To truly listen to black women's music making is to deeply pursue true sisterhood in the United States. To believe black women is to acknowledge the thickest intersections of identity in the United States. Therefore, it is a transgressive, womanist act for women of the African diaspora to collaborate musically under oppressive regimes \"in the quiet, undisputed dignity of our womanhood, without violence and without suing or special patronage,\" to borrow from Anna Julia Cooper, on the world stage. As we breeze through this digital age, the black women-founded movement #SayHerName beckons us to utter the names of music tastemakers Marian Anderson and Florence B. Price, sounding their signatures, like music to our ears, to undo with music what decades of sociopolitical inaudibility has done.",

            "article_content": "President Trump speaks to reporters outside the White House on Wednesday before departing for Kentucky.\n                \n                    \n                    Mark Wilson/Getty Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption President Trump speaks to reporters outside the White House on Wednesday before departing for Kentucky. President Trump doubled down Wednesday on his remarks that American Jews who vote for Democrats are disloyal to Israel. \"In my opinion, you vote for a Democrat, you're being very disloyal to Jewish people, and you're being very disloyal to Israel,\" Trump told reporters outside the White House on Wednesday, \"and only weak people would say anything other than that.\" It was the second time in two days that the president questioned the loyalty to Israel of Jewish people who vote Democratic. On Tuesday, he questioned their smarts, too. \"I think any Jewish people that vote for a Democrat, I think it shows either a total lack of knowledge or great disloyalty,\" Trump said from the Oval Office. Trump's comments display a lack of understanding of how and why Jewish Americans vote the way they do, which is overwhelmingly Democratic. While Israel is a threshold issue for Jewish voters, it is not determinative to the votes of most of them \u2014 and many don't agree with President Trump's or Republicans' approach to Israel. Jewish people who vote Democratic care about what Democrats care about \u2014 social justice, health care, climate change, the welfare of immigrants and more. Voters who identify as Jewish made up only about 3% of the U.S. electorate in recent presidential elections, but they have voted overwhelmingly Democratic. Since 1968, in fact, Jewish voters have voted on average 71% for Democrats. That was the exact number that went for Hillary Clinton in 2016. Their voting power in presidential elections can be felt in competitive states, like in South Florida, the north Philadelphia suburbs and to a lesser degree in Pittsburgh, Las Vegas, Cleveland, Detroit and outside Atlanta and Denver. Trump hopes to peel off some Jewish voters in what's expected to be a close reelection fight. He's trying to highlight comments by Democratic Reps. Ilhan Omar of Minnesota and Rashida Tlaib of Michigan, who have been hotly critical of Israel. Omar, in particular, has been criticized for some of her remarks. Democratic leaders and many rank-and-file Democratic elected officials have tried to distance themselves from their views. Trump, though, has tried to, as he says, make the congresswomen \"the face of the Democratic Party\" in an attempt to help him next year. But his strategy of highlighting Democrats' not walking in lockstep with Israel has been tried before \u2014 to no avail for Republicans. Think: President Barack Obama's nuclear deal with Iran or his criticism of Israeli settlement expansion. Obama still won 69% of the Jewish vote in 2012 and 78% in 2008. What's more, Jewish voters went for Democrats in the 2018 midterms by an even higher percentage \u2014 79%. And that was after Trump moved the U.S. Embassy in Israel to Jerusalem. \"We see evidence that it [the Jewish vote] is moving even more towards Democrats now during Trump's presidency,\" said Jim Gerstein, a Democratic pollster. He added that American Jews don't even necessarily agree with Trump's policies toward Israel \u2014 and they have other concerns. \"They're so hostile to Trump himself because of all the immigration issues and white nationalism and the rise of anti-Semitism, all that makes them so hostile to him that anything he says or does doesn't matter \u2014 even if they were to agree with it,\" said Gerstein, who called views of Israel \"a threshold issue\" for Jewish voters. \"But they don't necessarily agree with him on the Israel stuff to begin with.\" Jewish voters, like Catholics, vote less based on religion, but more reliably on their partisan identification. In other words, if someone is a Republican, they vote like one and vice versa. Disloyalty, \"a centuries-old anti-Semitic idea\" The \"disloyalty\" claim reminds some of an anti-Semitic trope. \"This loyalty claim or disloyalty claim is actually a centuries-old anti-Semitic idea that dates back to European monarchies,\" said Rabbi Alissa Wise, deputy director of Jewish Voice for Peace. \"This idea that Jews are somehow disloyal to or have more loyalty to an entity outside of the state to which they live.\" It's something for which Omar also faced criticism in February when she said, \"I want to talk about the political influence in this country, that says it is OK for people to push for allegiance to a foreign country.\" The Trump campaign argues that Democrats are the ones who \"embrace and defend the most vitriolic anti-Semites in their midst\" and are \"excusing and permitting such anti-Jewish venom to be spewed so freely,\" said Michael Glassner, the Trump campaign's chief operating officer, in a statement. Trump's comments Wednesday also came a day after he referred to Omar and Tlaib when he said, \"Where has the Democratic Party gone, where they're defending these two people over the state of Israel?\" Trump's remarks prompted a conservative radio host to call him the \"King of Israel,\" a comment that Trump retweeted. In response to a question about Reps. Ilhan Omar and Rashida Tlaib, President Trump said that \"any Jewish people who vote for a Democrat\" show a \"total lack of knowledge or great disloyalty.\" https://t.co/rSrHe7pFy0 Under pressure Tlaib and Omar were initially denied entry into Israel for a planned trip earlier this month because of their support for boycotts of the country. The decision from Israel came after Trump urged it. He all but taunted Israel, saying it \"would show great weakness\" if Israel let the two American congresswomen in. Israel relented and said it would allow Tlaib entry to see her grandmother on the West Bank, as long as she didn't voice support for boycotts on her trip. Tlaib decided she would not go and called the conditions \"oppressive.\" In a teary-eyed news conference Monday, Tlaib accused Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of taking \"a page out of Trump's book.\" Meanwhile, Democrats in the House, who don't always agree with Omar and Tlaib, are furious with Israel's ambassador to the United States, Ron Dermer, for his role in the controversy, the Jerusalem Post reported. Democrats may not take any more meetings with him, the paper reported, especially after Democratic leaders thought they had gotten assurances that the two congresswomen would be allowed to travel. There has long been a degree of distrust between Democrats and Dermer because he had worked as a Republican operative and helped orchestrate Netanyahu's speech to Congress in 2015, when Republican John Boehner was speaker, in which Netanyahu criticized then-President Obama's policy toward Iran. The Trump campaign apparatus went into overdrive on the subject Wednesday. Kayleigh McEnany, a campaign spokeswoman, blasted the BDS Movement, which seeks boycott, divestment, sanctions of Israel as well as an end to international support because of Israel's treatment of Palestinians. \"It is an actual movement that seeks to destroy the state of Israel by boycotting them,\" she said Wednesday on Fox News. \"It is the same goal as Iran, who wants to wipe Israel off the face of the map. It is an anti-Semitic movement. It is disgusting.\" But are Trump and his campaign's actions about winning over Jewish voters at all? Jeremy Ben-Ami of the progressive Jewish lobbying group J-Street doesn't think so. They seem more aimed at exciting the Trump base, Ben-Ami said. \"Israel is an issue not simply for the Jewish community,\" he noted. \"It is an evangelical issue. It's an issue in many red states. And it is comparable as a cultural divide on things like guns, abortion and other culture war issues.\" Trump has certainly sought to use cultural grievances as a way to keep his base on board throughout his presidency. And if that happens to peel away some voters in the process \u2014 or make them stay home \u2014 all the better.",

Updated at 5:30 p.m. ET President Trump on Thursday announced he is directing his administration to explore all regulatory and legislation solutions to \"protect the free speech of all Americans.\" Trump, speaking to conservative social media personalities at a White House  \"summit,\" said big tech \"must not censor the voices of the American people.\" \"We're not going to be silenced,\" he said. Trump complained that people have been unable to follow him on some social media platforms. \"People come up to me and say 'Sir, I can't follow you.' \" Facebook and Twitter were not included in Thursday's event. Trump announced that he will be calling a meeting of the major social media companies in the coming weeks. The president praised the participants in Thursday's East Room event. \"Some of you are extraordinary. The crap you think of is incredible.\" The president gave them a unique definition of the Constitution's First Amendment free speech protections. \"To me free speech is not when you see something good and then you purposefully write bad. To me that's very dangerous speech and you become angry at it. But that's not free speech.\" This comes at a time when the president, an enthusiastic user of social media \u2014 especially Twitter, which he often deploys to rally his base \u2014 has been criticizing the social media platforms, accusing them of silencing those who support him. One guest, a Twitter user who goes by CarpeDonktum, said that when he got the email invitation to the White House, he thought it might be spam. He requested that we withhold his real name. He says he fears retaliation against his family. The stay-at-home dad in Kansas is a celebrity in the conservative social media world \u2014 with more than 100,000 followers on Twitter. (His moniker is a play on the Latin phrase carpe diem \u2014 meaning seize the day. CarpeDonktum, seize the donkey, refers to Democrats.) He's a prolific creator of pro-Trump images and videos mocking the left, which he tweets out. Several of his spoofs have been retweeted by the president. CarpeDonktum announced his invitation on Twitter. The White House had kept quiet about the guest list. But it seemed to consist of the Trump Twitterverse, conservative social media personalities who orbit around Trump's Twitter star. And yet, Trump has attacked those same social media platforms that have been so key to his success. \"You look at Google, Facebook, Twitter and other social media giants, and I've made it clear that we as a country cannot tolerate political censorship, blacklisting and rigged search results,\" the president said last year. In May, Facebook banned several high-profile social media personalities who they say violated their policies against hate speech that engages in violence, including right-wing conspiracy theorist Alex Jones; extremists Milo Yiannopoulos, Laura Loomer and Joseph Watson, who works for Jones' Infowars; and white supremacist Paul Nehlen, who unsuccessfully ran for Congress in 2016 and 2018. The platform also banned Infowars, as well as Nation of Islam leader Louis Farrakhan. Twitter had already banned several of these personalities. Google, Facebook and Twitter all deny that they censor conservatives on their platforms, but a lot of conservatives don't believe that. Conservative talk show host Bill Mitchell is one of them. He blames Twitter's algorithm for some of his followers not being able to see his tweets. He'll be attending Thursday's social media summit, and he hopes they talk about how social media has become the modern public square and the responsibilities that come with that. \"If you become the public square, you really need to offer First Amendment protections to people,\" Mitchell said to NPR. \"Where everybody can have free and open speech. Let's have the debate. And may the best man win.\" Angelo Carusone, president of the media watchdog group Media Matters, believes in free speech, but he says some of the guests at the summit alarm him. \"There's a couple of establishment players there, but for the most part they're far-right extremists and a lot of people with ties to white nationalism.\" Mitchell and CarpeDonktum disavowed racism to NPR. But Media Matters points to other guests such as Charlie Kirk from Turning Point USA, an organization that has been accused of racist viewpoints. Carusone says the social media summit is a calculated political move on behalf of the Trump administration. He says it's validating extreme right points of view. \"The normalization of this is the part that concerns me.\" As the president rallies his base ahead of the 2020 elections, Carusone wonders about the effect of elevating these voices on the right.",

The limpet mines used to attack the tanker near the Strait of Hormuz resemble mines displayed by Iran, a Navy explosives expert said Wednesday. Iran denies being involved. Aaron David Miller (@aarondmiller2), a distinguished fellow at the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars and a former State Department adviser and Middle East negotiator, is the author of The End of Greatness: Why America Can't Have (and Doesn't Want) Another Great President. Richard Sokolsky, currently a nonresident senior fellow at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, worked in the State Department for six different administrations and was a member of the secretary of state's Office of Policy Planning from 2005-2015. Ever since World War II, wars have not been kind to American presidents. The United States didn't achieve victory in Korea, Vietnam, Iraq or Afghanistan, and the costs of these wars in human lives and dollars were staggering. They left bruises and tarnished legacies for the presidencies of Harry Truman, Lyndon Johnson, George W. Bush and Barack Obama. We're not predicting that America and Iran are inexorably headed toward a major war, though Iran's shoot-down overnight of a U.S. drone underscores the growing risk of conflict between the countries. Should war occur, President Trump will wish he had stayed out. Given that he defines the world in terms of his political rather than the national interest, he would be wise to consider the following. There's no good end game The Trump administration has conveyed no clear or realistic goals that would be served by the use of military force against Iran. Iran is too big and strong to be toppled, and there is no strong, united opposition capable of fomenting the kind of unrest that could overthrow the regime in the wake of U.S. military strikes. If the regime did collapse, it would likely be followed either by a period of instability or a government that is even more militantly anti-American. In response to more limited U.S. military attacks, Iran has many options available to raise the cost for the U.S. and its friends in the region \u2014 including in Lebanon, Iraq, Yemen and Afghanistan. There is no reason to believe that Iran's supreme leader is prepared to suffer the humiliation of returning to negotiations and caving to U.S. demands, especially since it was the Trump administration that walked away from an agreement with which the Iranians were complying. And there is no evidence that President Trump is willing to offer Iran concessions to lure Tehran back to the table. Furthermore, going to war without any clearly defined and attainable war aims is a recipe for an open-ended conflict almost certain to undermine U.S. interests and credibility. Riled oil markets Periods of Middle East tensions historically make for instability in oil markets. Hours after two tankers were disabled in the Gulf of Oman by what was almost certainly Iranian sabotage, oil prices spiked. The last thing Trump needs as the 2020 election approaches is rising gas prices. But that's likely what he'll get should the U.S. and Iran find themselves in conflict. Oil trades in a single market and regardless of increased U.S. production, disruptions in the supply of Persian Gulf oil will drive up prices. Iran has ample means \u2014 with anti-ship missiles, mines and torpedoes \u2014 to disrupt oil shipments. Even though the U.S. maintains overwhelming military preponderance in the region, it's an illusion to believe that restoring the uninterrupted flow of oil would be quick or easy in the face of a determined Iranian campaign to interdict shipping and to damage critical energy infrastructure in the Gulf. Tangled up in another foreign war President Trump has made getting out of unwinnable wars one of the hallmarks of his presidency. Trump's positions, from reducing the number of U.S. forces in Afghanistan to his great reluctance to deploy troops to Syria, show an awareness of the American public's aversion to new military adventures. Last February, he told CBS's Margaret Brennan that getting out of \"endless wars\" was one of his main messages and helped him defeat 17 Republicans for the nomination in 2016. And he has repeatedly expressed a desire to talk to the Iranians rather than to fight with them. Unless it's short and decisive, a risky, uncertain and open-ended conflict with Iran won't help him much with his Democratic opponent, independents or his base. In fact, an unnamed White House official told the Washington Examiner that it would \"absolutely alienate his base\" if he were to involve America in new war. America alone: Who will stand with the U.S.? The U.S. has had military and diplomatic support for every major war it has conducted since the end of the Korean War in 1953. Even in the unpopular 2003 invasion of Iraq, the Bush administration cobbled together a small coalition of willing countries to join America in combat. At best, should the U.S. go to war against Iran, it will be able to muster the diplomatic and perhaps military support of four countries: the United Kingdom, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates and Israel. Otherwise, the rest of the world has been completely put off by the Trump administration's unilateralism, belligerent nationalism, its decision to leave the nuclear agreement without a compelling cause and actions that are clearly aimed at provoking a military confrontation with Iran. A war with Iran without significant international support, and perceived to be America's fault, would leave the U.S. isolated and bearing full responsibility. More than likely, this kind of unilateralism would hand Russia and China \u2014 and Iran \u2014 an enormous propaganda advantage and weaken U.S. leverage in the days after. It is the day-after problem that looms large over America's experiences with the use of military force in Afghanistan, Iraq and even Syria. When a president is deciding whether to put Americans in harm's way, it's critical to ask not just can we, but should we, what will it cost and what's the exit strategy? We hope those are under consideration. Because of all the plausible military conflicts confronting America today, we cannot think of one that's more unnecessary, counterproductive and fraught with greater uncertainty and risk than stumbling or willfully heading into war with Iran.",

On Wednesday, a judge ruled that the publisher of the neo-Nazi website The Daily Stormer must pay American Muslim comedian Dean Obeidallah $4.1 million for falsely portraying him as a terrorist. In 2017, Obeidallah, a Daily Beast contributor, wrote an article for the site questioning President Trump's response to white supremacist violence. The following day, Daily Stormer founder Andrew Anglin smeared Obeidallah in a post casting him as the \"mastermind\" behind the Manchester Arena bombing that killed 22 people. \"He fabricated tweets that made it look like I was tweeting \u2014 that I was the mastermind of the bombing, I was cheering for it and I did it the name of Allah in my faith as a Muslim,\" Obeidallah told NPR's Michel Martin. \"They looked exactly real with retweets and likes and then [he] directed his readership at the The Daily Stormer to 'confront' me was the exact term.\" Commenters responded with graphic death threats against Obeidallah. \"They clearly thought I was a terrorist,\" he said. The Daily Stormer site, named after the Nazi propaganda newspaper Der St\u00fcrmer, spreads messages of anti-Semitism and white nationalism, including \"the coming race war,\" and is known to stoke violence from its audience. In 2017, James Jackson, a Daily Stormer reader and self-professed racist, traveled from Baltimore to New York where he fatally stabbed Timothy Caughman, a 66-year-old black man. In an act meant to \"provoke a race war,\" Jackson called his killing a \"declaration of global total war on the Negro race.\" Obeidallah mentioned Jackson's domestic terrorism conviction in the 2017 article that drove Anglin's readers to \"confront\" him. \"When they say 'confront' you. ... it's not a normal publication saying 'Go challenge his opinions,' \" Obeidallah said. \"It is direct action in encouraging people to literally confront me and to commit acts of violence.\" Though he felt the Daily Stormer community fomented violence, Obeidallah, a former lawyer, said he pursued a civil lawsuit because freedom of speech protections under the First Amendment would've complicated the criminal case route. \"To be charged criminally with inciting violence you must directly say 'Go get this person at this place at this time and we're gonna get him and we're going to kill him,' \" he said. \"Instead, it was slightly more ambiguous. But clearly, from a civil point of view, these tweets in this language was not protected by the First Amendment.\" Obeidallah said he's happy with the judgment but noted it can't make up for an unpleasant past couple of years. \"As a Muslim being attacked with the worst anti-Muslim trope you can say, is that I'm a Muslim I'm a terrorist,\" he says. \"It was painful to have friends and family express concerns. It was painful to contact security at Daily Beast and my radio channel to say, 'Hey, we might be visited by white supremacists coming to kill me and they might kill innocent people I work with.' That was all horrible.\" But he said he never once questioned pursuing legal action. He hopes the win serves as a \"roadmap\" to inspire others to speak up. \"There are lawyers who will represent you,\" he said. \"I'm not kidding \u2014 free of charge for this kind of work \u2014 to make it clear that we're not going to cower from these people. We're gonna sue them, we're going to win, we're gonna get their money.\" In a CNN opinion piece detailing his battle, he said he plans to donate the award money to organizations that combat bigotry. \"To me, the best way to use these white supremacists' money is to invest it in organizations and projects dedicated to countering and eradicating their hateful ideology,\" Obeidallah wrote.

            "article_content": "Trump Under Fire by Michael Wolff Hardcover, 335 pages | Your purchase helps support NPR programming. How? Michael Wolff's new book about President Trump, Siege: Trump Under Fire, offers many surprising stories \u2014 but its power to shock may be limited. Most Americans have long since decided what they think of Trump. And most people who pay attention to such books have made up their minds about Wolff, as well. There may never have been a more polarizing president, nor an author less likely to be read as a neutral recorder of facts. This is regrettable, because much of Wolff's gossipy but disturbing tale is not only plausible but credibly corroborated elsewhere. Siege includes events widely observed, or present in accessible public records. Yet all of that material has been conjoined with so much else that cannot be confirmed that the reader is apt to be left in doubt. Wolff is a longtime writer for popular magazines who scored a hit with Fire and Fury, his earlier account of Trump's first seven months in office. The first book, a runaway 2018 bestseller, was based partly on personal observation from weeks spent inside the White House. But in this sequel, Wolff relies primarily on interviews with current and former intimates of the president. Nearly all are unnamed, with the egregious exception of the book's mainspring source, former campaign manager Steve Bannon, of whom more in a moment. An author's credibility is everything in this kind of journalism, whether one is known primarily for entertainment reporting or for winning multiple Pulitzer prizes. And that is problematic for Wolff, because in this case the single most newsworthy item in the 315 pages of Siege has already been called into question. In his chapter on Special Counsel Robert Mueller and the probe of Russian interference in the 2016 election, Wolff says there was a draft version of a three-count criminal indictment against President Donald Trump as early as March 2018. He says the three charges (under Title 18 of the federal code Sections 1505, 1512 and 1513) did not stem from the Russian interference itself but from Trump's efforts to thwart the investigation. Wolff links this draft to Mueller's deputy Andrew Weissmann and reports that Mueller let it languish for nearly a year while preparing his own report, ultimately deferring to a longstanding Justice Department policy that a president could not be indicted while in office. Wolff says he got a look at the draft, and other related memoranda regarding that no-indictment policy, from \"a source close to the Office of Special Counsel.\" But the Office of Special Counsel on May 28 released a statement denying that account. \"The documents you describe do not exist,\" said Peter Carr, responding to questions from The Guardian and other media organizations. We can now expect the initial response to Siege to focus on this issue \u2014 and for the president and his defenders to say the rebuff from Mueller's team debunks the book more or less in its entirety. Much of the other controversy likely to greet the publication of Siege will concern things Trump is quoted as saying, often in late-night phone calls to his coterie of personal friends (most of whom seem to be New York business associates). Wolff would have us believe at least some of these midnight confidants have shared descriptions of Trump's sexual boasting, as well as his harsh assessments of rivals and critics and even of his own appointees and family members. For example, when former Trump lawyer Michael Cohen and accountant Allen Weisselberg agree to talk to investigators, Wolff quotes Trump saying \"the Jews always flip.\" And when Trump learns the White House counsel Donald McGahn has talked to Mueller's team, Wolff quotes the president saying \"McGahn is a dirty rat.\" Plausible? Believable? Perhaps, but the prejudice of the reader is not a substitute for evidence. If we do not know who supposedly told Wolff these things, we cannot even begin to assess whether Trump in fact said them. Wolff also claims that his own \"certain knowledge that in the end [Trump] will destroy himself\" is a view shared by \"almost everyone who has encountered him since he was elected president.\" The inclusion of \"almost\" scarcely rescues this assertion from obvious overstatement. Wolff also quotes an unnamed White House staffer \"who has spent almost countless hours with the president\" saying \"I have never met anyone crazier than Donald Trump.\" Wolff says he has heard something similar from \"a dozen others with firsthand experience.\" These group attributions may carry the added weight of numbers, but they suffer from the same essential lack of verifiability. Wolff does have one source on the record. Again and again. From chapter to chapter, almost page to page, we see the words of Steve Bannon, a former Trump campaign manager and then White House \"chief strategist\" for seven months. He later broke with Trump in the furor over Fire and Fury. The former chairman of the website Breitbart, Bannon has never quite left the world of \"alt-right\" media and movement politics. He has remained an active campaigner and adviser to nationalist and populist groups in Europe and elsewhere and worked for various Republican candidates in 2018. He also seems to have spent much of 2018 talking to Wolff, in whose new book he seems to be perched over the author's shoulder like Edgar Allan Poe's raven, squawking caustic remarks. In one moment, Wolff says Trump's businesses had \"increasingly seemed to resemble a semi-criminal enterprise\" and then has Bannon chuckling: \"I think we can drop the 'semi' part.\" At times, Bannon quite nearly takes over the narrative, as when Wolff lets one Bannon quote run without interruption for five pages. In truth, Bannon's idiosyncratic view of the world and raw language provide much of the color and punch in this book. But his vocabulary of imperatives and superlatives grows wearisome, like a sportscaster declaring each dramatic moment the turning point of the game. Bannon is always declaring one crisis or another \u2014 the budget, the wall, the midterms, the Brett Kavanaugh nomination to the Supreme Court \u2014 to be the crux of the entire Trump presidency. We have now seen nearly a dozen insider tell-alls emerge from Trumpworld, some by staffers such as Cliff Sims and Omarosa Manigault Newman and others by seasoned journalists such as Bob Woodward of the Washington Post. Two former heads of the FBI have penned critical memoirs that made the best-seller list. It can be said that each of these adds something to the mosaic, extending the tale of White House infighting and chaos a bit further into history. In this sense, they will be read, at least by many, as corroboration for each other. So by now we may find it easy to believe that McGahn was \"deeply depressed\" by the time he left the White House, or that he had a \"black hatred\" for Trump, as Wolff writes \u2014 even if we have this only from \"a friend.\" At times, even Wolff casts doubt on something he is reporting \u2014 such as Trump's claim to having had a sexual encounter with Nikki Haley, his first appointee as Ambassador to the United Nations. Wolff suggests he doesn't believe this happened, but he stands by reporting that \"multiple associates\" of the president told the author he had bragged about it. Wolff is not a policy maven, nor does he dwell on the deeper and even global political issues Trump represents \u2014 the rise of populist nationalism and the turn toward autocracy. Wolff's subject is the president as a personality, and the people in his immediate circle who observe that personality. And so it may seem quite natural for Wolff to rely on blind sourcing for his text. How else can a writer with an eye on book sales get some of the really good stuff on paper if he doesn't let folks dish anonymously? How else to get little anecdotes such as the one about Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and his wife, Transportation Secretary Elaine Chao, entertaining friends with their impressions of the president. Or the one about the time the president came into the Oval Office in such a \"full-on rage\" that \"his hair came undone [and] there stood an almost entirely bald Donald Trump.\" Among the head-shaking impressions from Siege is that of extraordinary events following on each other in such rapid succession that they quickly recede in memory. Was it really less than a year ago that Melania went to a military hospital in D.C. for \"a benign kidney ailment,\" staying there for days and out of the public eye for weeks? Was it really just last fall that the president refused to punish Saudi Arabia for the murder of journalist (and Virginia resident) Jamal Khashoggi? Or that Haley abruptly informed the White House she was leaving after less than two years at the U.N.? Was it just last July that Trump went to Helsinki and held a two-hour meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin with no other American official in the room, emerging later to say he accepted Putin's denials of Russian interference in the 2016 election? Was it just last Christmas that Defense Secretary James Mattis resigned in dismay at the president tweeting a decision to withdraw all U.S. forces from Syria immediately? And the government shut down for five weeks because the president did not like the Twitter and talk show treatment of his budget deal with his own party's congressional leaders? Wolff has pulled these and other cases from the file drawer, one by one, waving them overhead like a courtroom lawyer summing up for the jury. In this case, it is likely the jury has already made up its mind. Most of those who read this book will already believe terrible things about Trump. There will be those too who dismiss the book in its entirety as a compendium of illegitimate charges \u2014 as prejudiced as they are unproven. But if nothing else, Wolff has performed a kind of service in Siege by taking us back over this rocky ground and reminding us what a long strange trip it has already been.",

Cory Booker, D-N.J., tells the NPR Politics Podcast and New Hampshire Public Radio that he would bring a \"creativity\" to the presidency. Updated at 12:15 p.m. ET In a presidential field filled with Democrats ready to take President Trump head-on, Sen. Cory Booker is betting voters are more interested in finding common ground and unity. \"My whole career has been marked by taking on the toughest problems, bringing people together, creating uncommon coalitions to ultimately produce uncommon results \u2014 things that people said couldn't be done,\" Booker told the NPR Politics Podcast on Monday in Concord, N.H. He also said, though, that he hopes \"done are the days that we think some savior is going to come in and be the sole purveyor of hope and possibility.\" The interview is the first in a series that the podcast will conduct with Democratic presidential candidates, in collaboration with New Hampshire Public Radio and Iowa Public Radio. The conversation with Booker touched on a wide range of issues: how to regulate social media giants like Facebook, how he could make good on his lofty goals of bringing Americans together \u2014 and the Star Trek fanatic's favorite USS Enterprise captain. Listen to this episode and read highlights below: On actually ending divisions Detrow: When I hear you talk about that revival of civic grace I wonder how you use the presidency to do that, because nobody talked about hope and unity more than Barack Obama. He literally sang \"Amazing Grace\" in 2015. And yet, after eight years of President Obama, there was an anger and a division in this country that played out in the 2016 election. So what can you do from that position that he wasn't able to do? Booker: I am literally sitting here as the fourth popularly elected African American in the history of the Senate, and the rights and privileges I'm enjoying were fought by people who were told: \"You're moving too fast. You can't get this done. It's impossible to pass civil rights legislation.\" ... But we did not give up. What we did do was have activists and leaders that were able to inspire the moral imagination of our country to get us to do things we didn't achieve before. You have just seen a president do the exact opposite, and quite effectively. He's using the highest office in this land to commit act after act of moral vandalism to do things to divide, demean and degrade us. And he is doing great in the politics of pitting Americans against each other. And so the flip side of that is, I believe, that the right leaders \u2014 plural \u2014 because I hope done are the days that we think some savior is going to come in and be the sole purveyor of hope and possibility. What we need is a president that trusts the American people, that works with them and does things to revive those ideals I talked about. But more than that uses creativity from their office like I did when I was mayor, when I had a nation that looked at Newark, N.J., as a place you don't go to. ... That you don't invest in because it's decaying. And we turned that perception around. So I will bring a creativity to the office. Actions that use not just the official powers of the presidency, but ways that you inspire the moral imagination in this country, as presidents did to do things people said couldn't be done, like putting someone on the moon. Gun control \u2013 balancing due process with strict new laws McDermott: So you just put out a multipart plan to reduce gun violence, and that's something that we heard you talk about today, in terms of your personal exposure to the consequences of gun violence. That that plan includes a lot of different components. But one of them would be to incentivize states to pass what are called extreme-risk protective orders, or sometimes \"red flag laws.\" That's something that we've heard politicians in New Hampshire look at. But one of the things that comes up here is people have raised concerns about \u2014 how do you balance due process when you put together that kind of a policy? So what do you think about how you would approach that? Booker: There is a grievous urgency to this that when \u2014 my plan is based on not just the personal experiences as the only person in this election, I think, or the only person in the Senate I think that has had shootings in the neighborhood, shootings on their block. There is a personal urgency to this. But the plan itself is actually based on evidence, based on things that we know work. And so when it comes to red flag laws to me, if we can't find a way to get the details right and surrender on the whole plan because we can't get the details right, then we're not going to solve the problem of folks getting their hands on guns that should not have them. I often hear people who want to quibble on a lot of the details. But we should at least endorse the policy and work on getting it right through the legislative process. And so I imagine, you need to balance due process. I'm all for that, but you cannot have a society where someone who is showing sign after sign of distress, sign after sign of imminent danger to themselves, can go into a gun shop and pass a background check and get a weapon. That's what I'm trying to get at. I know we can get there. McDermott: So are there any specific provisions that you think would be really important to have in that kind of a policy? Booker: Yes ... there's opportunities for judicial review. There should be a process put forward that you to have to go through. I think it should involve law enforcement, I think it should be temporal \u2014 in other words, you don't permanently lose your gun rights. There should be opportunities for appeal. A lot of the substance that we've spelled out in general, due process should apply to this. Regulating Facebook and other social media giants Detrow: I think a lot of people in America are still adjusting to this governing-by-tweet style of President Trump. But you were really the first politician, in a much different way, to embrace Twitter and to use it to create community to reach out to people. So I'm wondering as you sit here in 2019 \u2014 and you probably might have a different answer than you did at the beginning of your mayoral career \u2014 do you think that social media has done more harm or good? Booker: I'm glad you recognized that. We were really early innovators on the platform, and we realized we can go from, you know, e-government, which people talked about, to \"we government.\" And we really empowered our constituents in Newark not just to drive by a traffic light that's out but to actually take a picture of it and tweet your mayor. And we actually used it as an efficiency tool and could start driving down the amount of time it took to fix a pothole from, God, when I got to Newark it was maybe weeks if not months to fix a pothole, to literally hours. And I was very proud of how we created more community as you said, bonds that were tighter, where more people were taking responsibility for their neighborhoods. And in that sense social media created constructive social environments. Detrow: But there's so much downside. I mean, white nationalism has been reinvigorated ... Booker: Absolutely \u2014 not just white nationalism. I'm worried about privacy issues, I'm worried about Russian attacks. They literally, if you if you look at what their insidious aims are \u2014 to divide this country, is to make us hate each other, to make us not to trust media. But even this: one's self-esteem. I've seen studies for young kids about what it's doing to their own views of themselves, of their own worth. And so we need to start having a far more determined conversation about the upside and the downside and learn how to mitigate these issues that are real. And government does have a role. Detrow: And is that through the Department of Justice, or through ... something like the [Securities and Exchange Commission] treating it as a regulated business? Booker: Well, I think it's a lot of the above. ... I think that we've seen with the erosion of net neutrality just all the different people that have touches upon this marketplace. And so yeah, I do think it's the DOJ, and I do think that this problem we've had with corporate consolidation that we need to start taking antitrust law seriously. I do think it's the [Federal Trade Commission] as well. There's a lot of ways that we have to approach this problem, but we right now have a president and an administration that seems to not have an approach and not recognize that this is a problem whether it's Russian interference or the privacy we all have.",

Updated 8:54pm E.T. As New Zealand grapples with the aftermath of the attack on two Muslim congregations in Christchurch, the mass shootings on the other side of the world have struck fear through Muslim American communities and renewed calls for action against the rise of bigotry in the U.S. Muslim Americans urged political leaders, local officials and tech companies to confront the alarming spread of hate and racism that in recent years has led to scores of worshippers being slaughtered in religious institutions. At a press conference in Washington, D.C., Friday, Council on American-Islamic Relations Executive Director Nihad Awad demanded President Trump unequivocally condemn the attacks, saying his words and policies \"impact the lives of innocent people at home and globally.\" Council on American-Islamic Relations (CAIR) Executive Director Nihad Awad to Pres. Trump:\"Your words matter. Your policies matter ... You should condemn this not only as a hate crime, but as a white supremacist terrorist attack ... You need to condemn this community today.\" pic.twitter.com/xp6WjAbGs7 \"You should condemn this not only as a hate crime, but as a white supremacist terrorist attack,\" Awad said. \"You need to assure all of us \u2014 Muslims, blacks, Jews, immigrants \u2014 that we are protected and you will not tolerate any physical violence against us because we are immigrants or we are minorities. You need to condemn this clearly today and you do not need to be vague. You have to be very clear on this.\" The alleged shooter, who is now in custody along with two others, live-streamed the massacre over Facebook. In the end, at least 49 people were killed and another 48 are being treated in hospitals. You need to condemn this clearly today and you do not need to be vague. You have to be very clear on this. Nihad Awad, Council On American-Islamic Relations In writings outlining his beliefs, the Australian man described himself as a 28-year-old claiming to represent Europeans and whites in a battle against immigrants \u2014 people he repeatedly called \"invaders.\" Throughout the screed, which he posted to several sources online, he cited his hatred for Islam and referred to the U.S. Constitution's Second Amendment, arguing that attempts by the government to take away guns will lead to civil war. Awad of CAIR alluded to President Trump's proclivity for hyper-nationalist and xenophobic rhetoric on the campaign trail and as president and placed some of the blame for the ambush in New Zealand, at his feet. \"During your presidency and during your election campaign, Islamophobia took a sharp rise and attacks on innocent Muslims, innocent immigrants and mosques have skyrocketed,\" Awad said. \"We hold you responsible for this growing anti-Muslim sentiment in the country and in Europe, but also we do not excuse those terrorist attackers against minorities at home and abroad.\" Similarly, Muslim Advocates, a national civil rights group, urged Trump to disavow the attackers and the white nationalist movement in general, which they say invoke the president as an inspiration and a symbol of the white identity movement. \"In the wake of this heartbreaking, anti-Muslim mass slaughter, it is clear that more needs to be done to protect Muslims and all vulnerable communities from the very real dangers posed by hate and white nationalists. ... It is time for President Trump, elected officials, law enforcement and tech companies to act,\" Farhana Khera, the group's executive director, said in a statement. Khera noted Trump's 2017 comments following the deadly Unite the Right rally in Charlottesville, Va., in which the president referred to neo-Nazi and white nationalist protesters as \"very fine people.\" \"This hate-filled murderer,\" she said, referring to the Christchurch shooter, \"drew inspiration from Trump, and the white nationalist movement has celebrated Trump's words and policies.\" With hate crimes motivated by anti-Muslim bigotry rising to historic levels in recent years in the U.S., Khera said the FBI must \"prioritize the prevention, detection, investigation and prosecution of right-wing, white nationalist violence \u2014 the most significant threat to public safety in our nation today.\" Additionally, social media platforms and tech companies like Facebook, Twitter and Google, which hate groups use to disseminate vile messages of prejudice and violence, and build their membership, need to do more to detect and shut down online objectionable content, Khera said. Facebook moved quickly to take down the horrific video capturing the bloodshed in real time, as well as the alleged shooter's Facebook and Instagram accounts. But by the time it did so, there was little the company could do to stop internet users from re-uploading the video to YouTube, Twitter, Reddit and other online platforms. \"The New Zealand shooter was able to livestream a 17-minute video of his murderous rampage that continues to spread like wildfire online. This is flatly unacceptable. Tech companies must take all steps possible to prevent something like this from happening again,\" Khera said. Rabbi Elliot Cosgrove of the Park Avenue Synagogue in New York City bought a massive bouquet of white flowers to the Islamic Cultural Center in Manhattan after the mass shootings at two New Zealand mosques.\n                \n                    \n                    Joel Rose/NPR\n                    \n                \nhide caption Rabbi Elliot Cosgrove of the Park Avenue Synagogue in New York City bought a massive bouquet of white flowers to the Islamic Cultural Center in Manhattan after the mass shootings at two New Zealand mosques. Sen. Mark Warner, (D- Va.), also pointed to the social media platforms as inadvertent facilitators of heinous ideology. \"The rapid and wide-scale dissemination of this hateful content \u2014 live-streamed on Facebook, uploaded on YouTube and amplified on Reddit \u2014 shows how easily the largest platforms can still be misused,\" Warner told The Washington Post. \"It is ever clearer that YouTube, in particular, has yet to grapple with the role it has played in facilitating radicalization and recruitment.\" Twitter and Youtube have both condemned the attacks and said they are working to bring down any video of the shooting. Trump on white nationalism Speaking to reporters on Friday afternoon, President Trump denied white nationalism poses an increasingly dangerous global threat. \"I think it's a small group of people that have very, very serious problems, I guess. If you look what happened in New Zealand, perhaps that's the case. I don't know enough about it yet...But it's certainly a terrible thing,\" he said. He made the remarks shortly after signing the first veto of his presidency \u2014 a move that allows him to declare a national emergency along the southern border and pump billions of dollars into the construction of a wall, which he has said is being overrun by criminals seeking to harm Americans. \"People hate the word invasion, but that's what it is,\" Trump said Friday. Friday prayers Muslims, who gathered for Friday prayers at mosques around the country, were unified in their grief over the tragedy and their refusal to be intimidated. In New York City, the Islamic Cultural Center opened its door wide, and spread prayer mats in the courtyard for an overflow crowd. Reem Elsobky, a doctor visiting from Toronto, told NPR she felt it was important to attend prayers at the mosque after learning about the carnage in New Zealand \"because we're not going to be afraid to come to our prayer places.\" \"Everyone should feel safe when they pray,\" she said. Elsobky recalled a similar attack in Canada in 2017, when a gunman opened fire at a mosque in Quebec City. The memory still haunts her. \"Unfortunately, every time I go to the mosque in Canada in downtown Toronto, I think about it.\" \"Do I bring my kids or not?\" she often wonders. But in the end, she said people should not be deterred by the possibility of violence. \"You can't live your life in fear.\" Burjan Ugural, a New York City taxi driver, said the shooters in New Zealand should be considered terrorists. \"Terror has no nationality. Terror has no religion. Nobody can say this is 'Islamic terror,' this is Catholic terror.' Terror is terror.\" Faith leaders of other religions stopped by the mosque to offer their condolences. Rabbi Elliot Cosgrove of the nearby Park Avenue Synagogue bought a massive bouquet of white flowers. He said his congregation hasn't forgotten at the mass shooting at a synagogue in Pittsburgh last year. \"The Jewish community knows, with the Pittsburgh shooting, what it means to have the promise of synagogue ripped out from under you,\" Cosgrove said. The New York Police Department's counterterrorism unit stationed heavily armed officers outside a number of New York City mosques and other religious institutions on Friday.\n                \n                    \n                    Joel Rose /NPR\n                    \n                \nhide caption The New York Police Department's counterterrorism unit stationed heavily armed officers outside a number of New York City mosques and other religious institutions on Friday. In Washington, D.C., Areeba Khan, an intern for Democratic Sen. Chris Coons of Delaware, attended the Friday prayer services offered at the Capitol. \"It's a blessed day and to find out that that occurred, it really impacted me personally ... it made me feel really scared in the moment,\" Khan told NPR, adding that she found it comforting to be surrounded by members of the Muslim community. Emad Alsagheer, a federal contractor for the Federal Trade Commission, said he first learned of the shooting when his friend texted him the livestream video of the attacker. As an immigrant from Syria, he didn't expect events like the New Zealand attack to happen outside of war zones. \"I do not expect these things to actually happen in a peaceful community where the people are not in a war, or in a war zone,\" Alsagheer said. \"I actually left [Syria] because it was being bombed ... I've been in very bad situations, I witnessed a lot of horrible things, but this was really a shock to me because I wasn't prepared to see [the video].\" Heightened security Although Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen said there are no \"current, credible\" threats against Muslim communities in the U.S., officials tightened security at mosques around the country. The New York Police Department's counterterrorism unit stationed heavily armed officers outside a number of New York City mosques and other religious institutions. \"To the Muslim community here in new York: we stand with you always, and we will remain vigilant in keeping you safe \u2014 and making sure you feel safe too,\" Police Commissioner James O'Neill said in a statement. The people #NYPD serves, in every #NYC neighborhood, must always be free from fear & have the immutable right to worship & live in peace. Together, NYers will never allow terrorists \u2014 who thrive on violence & fear \u2014 to threaten our people or our values. My full statement, here:\u2b07\ufe0f pic.twitter.com/XQqOSUgr2n",

            "article_content": "A new documentary provides an unsparing look at former Trump adviser Steve Bannon, including his casual talk of apocalypse and trademark look of dissolution.\n                \n                    \n                    Jeffrey T. Barnes/AP\n                    \n                \nhide caption A new documentary provides an unsparing look at former Trump adviser Steve Bannon, including his casual talk of apocalypse and trademark look of dissolution. Federal judges have sentenced other former aides of Donald Trump to prison, but a filmmaker is seeking a different kind of judgment on Steve Bannon, the onetime guru who thinks he's the one who got Trump elected president. In filmmaker Alison Klayman's The Brink, viewers are invited to render the kind of judgment that will not be subject to any presidential pardon power. Klayman's film is nearly two hours of unbridled Bannon with little battening. We are invited to marvel anew at all the hyperbole and dishevelment, the casual talk of apocalypse and the trademark look of dissolution. But we are also shown what some have found charming, even irresistible about the man. We see fans clapping and giggling at the prospect of meeting him. We see him holding forth in living rooms and lodge halls, revving up red-state crowds large and small. This is where we hear Bannon speak of Trump's election as an act of God, recruiting activists by adding that \"Divine intervention needs human agency.\" He can sometimes entertain, as Klayman has said, as though he were in a comedy club. And so he seems to own a stage even in Toronto, of all places, entertaining a largely skeptical, if not hostile, audience in a concert auditorium. (\"I've got all evening to convert you folks!\") Klayman spent months of 2017 and 2018 tracking Bannon to a succession of lairs, many in luxurious European locales. (One such suite, walls aching with art, overlooks a Venetian waterway over which looms the St. Mark's Basilica.) \"I'm gonna get crushed in this film,\" Bannon wails at one point. \"She's gotten every five-star hotel...\" At times he speaks straight to the camera, making pronouncements about the righteous American working-class uprising that ushered Trump into the Oval Office. More often, he is seen gazing out windows into the middle distance, muttering soliloquies \u2014 wistful but always self-aware. Does he forget he's on camera? \"Steve Bannon is always performing for every person who is in the room,\" Klayman says. \"Even when he's alone.\" Why do people submit to such invasions of privacy? At a screening in Washington on Tuesday night, Klayman introduced her co-producer, Marie Therese Guirgis, who turns out to have produced, among other things, the cooperation of the film's subject. Guirgis had worked for Bannon during his years as a film producer a decade ago. She liked him; he trusted her. Next thing you knew, Bannon was agreeing to have Klayman quietly present, shooting and recording as he went about his business. Klayman says she made a conscious decision: \"I would let him underestimate me and never let myself underestimate him.\" The real art in such cinema verite is often in the editing, and Klayman (known for her film on Chinese dissident artist Ai Weiwei) has cut this film with drive, perception and purpose. We are with her subject in his highs and lows, great moments, small, manic moods and dark ones. Adding a certain sense of faded luster in the film are the friends and hangers on we see, from a nephew who brings Bannon his Coke or kombucha to Trump sycophant Sam Nunberg (\"I got Trump onto Twitter\") to the former Goldman Sachs president, John Thornton, who hangs out and encourages Bannon to be the intellectual entrepreneur for the populist-nationalist uprisings of our time. In one remarkably unguarded moment, Bannon rebukes Nunberg for calling Trump a friend. \"When you reach [Trump's] level you don't have grundoons for friends,\" Bannon says, sitting across from Nunberg on a private jet. \"Guys like you and Corey [Lewandowski] and [Roger] Stone think you're his friends.\" In the end the portrait of Bannon, the one-time publisher of Breitbart who ran the final months of Trump's 2016 campaign, is neither empathetic nor sympathetic. It is unsparing with its subject and his evident sadness. We see the Bannon who segued from campaign chief to \"chief strategist\" in the White House, holding that title for most of 2017. But we also see the Bannon who took the fall for the political disaster following the white supremacist march in Charlottesville, Va. Trump tried to straddle that crisis by saying there were \"good people on both sides.\" It didn't work, and Bannon was soon a civilian again. Since his banishment from the White House, Bannon has given interviews to journalists and memoirists and sought to find his own space in the world of politics that was redefined by his former boss. He takes great pride in the Trump victory, and he takes his share of credit for it. In fact, he seems semi-obsessed with Trumpian energy and formula that worked in 2016. He shows real depression over the idea of losing the Republican majority in the House in the 2018 midterms. He warns all who will listen in the fall of 2018 that a Democratic majority in the House will control the appropriations process (as they have) and block funding for the border wall (as they have) and potentially move to impeach (which they still might). He is especially fixated on the fate of the wall, which he calls \"the key to the whole Trump presidency.\" When the November 2018 election results come in, Bannon seems discouraged at the prospect that his timetable will now need some adjusting. But it is, he allows, a historical process with an open-ended time frame. \"This is a global revolution,\" he muses. \"And I'm just very lucky to be at the vanguard.\" Being the tip of that spear not only appeals to Bannon but gives him a mission for his post-Trump life. He is building a \"global movement\" against globalism, no irony intended. And his definition of globalism includes immigration, the European Union, trade deals, multinational peacekeeping missions and all those elitists he calls \"the Davos crowd.\" France's far-right party Front National President Marine Le Pen, right, applauds Bannon after his speech to the party's annual congress, in 2018 in Lille, France.\n                \n                    \n                    Philippe Huguen/AFP/Getty Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption France's far-right party Front National President Marine Le Pen, right, applauds Bannon after his speech to the party's annual congress, in 2018 in Lille, France. Much of the film depicts Bannon's networking with a ragtag assortment of European Trump wannabes. The more major figures of nationalism and right-wing populism, such as France's Marine Le Pen or Hungary's Viktor Orban, are seen only in stock film clips and stills. The participants in Bannon's various conclaves are more on the level of Nigel Farage (an impresario of Brexit in Great Britain) and various nativists and right-wing activists from Western Europe. At one point, Bannon kvetches about prototypes for the website and literature of his organization, which he wants to call \"The Movement.\" The designs look cheap, not \"classic\" enough. He denounces and browbeats his subordinates by cell phone. In the film, Bannon is interviewed by Paul Lewis, a writer for The Guardian. Lewis appeared with Klayman and Guirgis on Tuesday night in Washington, and acknowledged Bannon's claim of intercontinental importance. Nonetheless, Lewis insists, Bannon is simply not a factor in European populism. What Bannon is, Lewis adds, is \"very effective at portraying himself as enormously important to that movement.\" In the end, that may well have been Bannon's intent in cooperating in the making of The Brink. But the story the film tells is ultimately quite different. The film is scheduled for general release on March 29.",

On Tuesday, Bolsonaro will headline the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland. A new president is elected. Within days of being sworn in, he pulls his country out of a U.N. migration pact. His path to power has been pockmarked by disparaging comments about women, including a congresswoman. His preferred choice for top posts are members of the armed forces. When he appoints a fifth military official to his cabinet, he makes the announcement via Twitter, his favored means of communications. Sound familiar? These are the tactics of Brazil's new president, Jair Bolsonaro, who was sworn in to office on Jan. 1, 2019. On Tuesday, Bolsonaro will headline the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, an annual gathering that attracts heads of state \u2014 65 of them this year \u2014 corporate CEOs and billionaire investors. Bolsonaro's nationalistic rhetoric is in sharp contrast to a gathering that has long stood for globalization and has pushed to strengthen international ties. His tactics may remind many of the American president's. But it is actually symptomatic of a global wave that started almost a decade ago and has only strengthened in recent years. From Turkey and Hungary, to India and the Philippines, the voices of nationalism and the far right have become dominant forces that begin with the election of a charismatic, influential and powerful man. Hungary, for instance, was once a leader in the drive for democracy in East Europe. But after strongman Viktor Orban rose to power as prime minister in 2010, Hungary's democratic institutions have been dramatically weakened. In his first year in office, Orban's party amended the constitution 10 times. A wholly new constitution was put in place. It whittled down the power of courts, changed how elections are supervised and dramatically curbed media. New positions were created and filled with Orban allies. The moves have been broadly condemned, including by the European Parliament and the United States. Orban is one of the strongest symbols of this shift. He was one of the first Western leaders to endorse Donald Trump and pursue friendly relations with Russian President Vladimir Putin. Last year, Orban won a third term in a landslide victory after pledging to create a \"Christian homeland.\" Similarly, in the Philippines, President Rodrigo Duterte swept to power in 2016, promising to be tough on drug criminals. As he carried out that promise, it resulted in the deaths of thousands of alleged drug dealers across the country. Human rights groups say the innocent poor have borne the brunt of these killings. Duterte uses profanities with abandon, he has compared himself to Hitler and has insulted world leaders. He too wants to change the constitution in Philippines. And Turkey, once a bastion of secularism, today is rife with religious conflict. Its leader Recep Tayyip Erdogan, president since 2014, has crushed dissent and jailed journalists. Last year, the government's Directorate of Religious Affairs ordered all of Turkey's nearly 90,000 mosques to broadcast a verse from the Koran through loudspeakers on their minarets. The move led writer Soner Cagaptay to declare that Sharia is gradually taking over long-secular Turkey. Cagaptay is a senior fellow at the Washington Institute for Near East Policy, a group known for being outspoken on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. And then there's India's Prime Minister Narendra Modi, leader of the world's largest democracy. Under his Hindu nationalist party, the country has pursued laws that hurt the minority Muslim population. For instance, his party declared that eating beef is \"against the idea of India.\" This led to a ban in the sale of cows for slaughter. While beef is taboo for Hindus, it isn't so for Muslims and the decree led to the closing of many slaughterhouses and meat shops, traditionally owned by Muslims in India. The nationalist zeal has also led to curbing of charities operating in India. Tens of thousands of foreign-funded non-government organizations, like Greenpeace India, Ford Foundation and Amnesty International, were either put on notice or had their licenses revoked. Amnesty, which often accuses the Indian government of human rights violations, said a raid of its offices was aimed at silencing critics. In Brazil, President Bolsonaro pushed forth an almost identical move after taking office earlier this month. He used an executive order that gave his government far-reaching and restrictive powers over non-governmental organizations working in Brazil. Ultimately, it is moves like these that have global hackles rising for proponents of democratic values. In almost each of these instances, the leaders have swept into power on a promise to accelerate economic growth and create new opportunities for those left behind by globalization. But the promises are often laced with undercurrents of nationalism that harp on race or religion and closing borders. These leaders often have a strong base of support. And often they have a pro-business agenda, which stock markets cheer. The American stock market has been on a roller coaster \u2014 calmer now after a rough ride at the end of the year. But for many months after Trump's election, investors gave the U.S. president a clear thumbs up. Brazil's investors are doing the same, and Bolsonaro has tweeted about it. Last year, Trump told the crowd at Davos: \"I'm here to deliver a simple message: There has never been a better time to hire, to build, to invest and to grow in the United States. America is open for business.\" Bolsonaro will likely echo the same sentiments. Trump also said: \"America First does not mean America alone.\" Undoubtedly, Bolsonaro believes in Brazil First. And Orban in Hungary First. Likewise, Erdogan for Turkey and Modi for India. But if it is everyone for himself, who really wins? Pallavi Gogoi is NPR's chief business editor.",

India's Hindu nationalist ruling party wants a temple to a god built on the ruins.  RACHEL MARTIN, HOST: Voting is underway in India's national elections, and this week we're bringing you a series of stories about how India is redefining itself through its majority Hindu faith. Today we take you to a holy place in northern india; it's where, nearly 30 years ago, Hindu activists tore down a historic mosque. NPR's Lauren Frayer reports from Ayodhya. SYED IKHLAQ LATIFI: (Foreign language spoken). LAUREN FRAYER, BYLINE: Syed Ikhlaq Latifi (ph) is 80 years old, with a bushy white beard, but he's still able to scramble upstairs to his roof to describe what he watched from here in horror back in 1992. LATIFI: (Through interpreter) A mob broke through barricades around the 16th-century Babri mosque, just over there. They climbed on top of the domes and tombs. They were carrying hammers and these three-pronged spears from Hindu scripture. They started hacking at the building; by night, it was destroyed, and then they set fire to nearby Muslim homes. FRAYER: Latifi watched as flames lit up the night sky, and then he fled for his life. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) UNIDENTIFIED PEOPLE: (Foreign language spoken). FRAYER: Footage from that day shows the mob rampaging through Muslim homes and businesses. Riots spread across India and neighboring countries. Thousands were killed, including Tayab-un-Nisa's (ph) husband. Now in her 70s, she sits with her granddaughters... UNIDENTIFIED CHILD: Hello. FRAYER: ...Paging through photo albums. UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #1: (Foreign language spoken). FRAYER: That's a picture of her husband. Her father-in-law had been the imam of the famous Babri Masjid - Babri mosque. It was built nearly 500 years ago, under India's then-Muslim rulers, the Mughals. Her husband was from a prominent Ayodhya family. But the mosque is now gone, and her husband was bludgeoned to death right next to her front gate. TAYAB-UN-NISA: (Foreign language spoken). FRAYER: \"I've wept a lifetime of tears,\" she says. TAYAB-UN-NISA: (Foreign language spoken). FRAYER: Hindu activists from all over India came to Ayodhya that day to correct what they perceived as a historical injustice - the building of a mosque more than four centuries earlier and the cropping up of a Muslim community around it in a spot sacred to Hindus, the place where they believe one of their gods, Lord Ram, was born. It would be the equivalent, faithful say, of a mosque on the exact spot in Bethlehem where Jesus is said to have been born or a church on top of the Prophet Muhammad's birthplace in Mecca. SHRIRAJ NAIR: Even bigger than that; even more significant than that, we believe, yeah. I felt very proud when the mosque was demolished. FRAYER: Shriraj Nair (ph) is a suburban dad in Mumbai. Back then, he was 19 years old and passionate about his Hindu faith. He was and still is active in the RSS, the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh - it's one of the Hindu volunteer groups whose members wielded hammers at the Babri mosque that day. Nair couldn't go - he had a family commitment - but he watched on TV as his comrades travelled to Ayodhya from all over India. NAIR: People travelled. It was a huge, huge mob. The Hindus came on their own, and they fought for demolishing the mosque. And from that time onward, the word Hindutva, or the feeling of being Hindu, came in everybody's mind. It was a big success. FRAYER: It was a milestone for that word he just used - Hindutva; it means Hindu pride. Some call it Hindu nationalism. It was then that India began to shed the secularism that had defined it since independence from Britain. It's when Hindu priorities gained prominence in Indian politics. For Hindu voters who cared deeply about Lord Ram's legendary birthplace, step one was destroying the Babri mosque. Step two is building a Hindu temple in its place, and that's what Prime Minister Narendra Modi's party has promised to do if reelected. Party chief Amit Shah at a rally in January. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) AMIT SHAH: (Through interpreter) Our party wants a temple to Lord Ram built on that same spot, as soon as possible; no doubt about it. FRAYER: The 1992 killings in Ayodhya were a horrible bout of sectarian violence. But to many of India's majority Hindus, they were also a new beginning - of removing remnants of a Muslim civilisation and restoring a Hindu one. Now nearly 30 years later, Modi's party is making those sentiments a priority, in a way that no other government has ever done before. UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #2: (Foreign language spoken). FRAYER: Demonstrations have erupted across India, calling for the immediate construction of a temple in Ayodhya. But this is sensitive; it could spark more clashes. Modi initially promised construction would begin in his first term - it hasn't happened. India's Supreme Court now controls the property and is hearing petitions on what can be built. Some on the far right accuse Modi of dragging his feet. The temple, which doesn't yet exist, nevertheless already has a chief priest in waiting. SATENDRA DAS: (Singing in a foreign language). FRAYER: Satendra Das (ph) is also 80 years old, with a long white beard. He wears a bright saffron orange Hindu robe, and unlike Syed Ikhlaq Latifi, who watched the destruction of the Babri mosque from his roof, Das charged into the melee that day. DAS: (Foreign language spoken). FRAYER: He explains how, decades earlier, Hindus had managed to place a small Lord Ram statue inside the Babri mosque. Das was its caretaker, so he was allowed to enter the building. And when the mob attacked in 1992, Das ran in to grab that idol and, afterward, placed it atop the mosque's ruins, where it still sits today. UNIDENTIFIED POLICE: (Foreign language spoken). FRAYER: Hundreds of police now patrol the heart of Ayodhya. I had to pass through a maze of wire cages and metal detectors, surrender my passport, get patted down by female guards, just to get within view of the Babri mosque's ruins - and there's nothing left. This is probably India's most incendiary spot. In the old city of Ayodhya, where three Islamic domes once towered for more than 450 years, there's a small blue tarp draped over stilts, and under it, that idol of the Hindu god Lord Ram. With me in line are thousands of Hindus, pilgrims from all over India. Many of them are barefoot. One woman is weeping. UNIDENTIFIED PEOPLE: (Chanting in a foreign language). FRAYER: \"Long live Lord Ram,\" they chant and shuffle past. There are so many of them, and they are determined to be heard, both here and at the polls in this Indian election.

            "article_content": "After Republican Rep. Steve King of Iowa was rebuked by the U.S. House this week for making racist comments, voters in his district are debating his remarks and whether he should stay in office.  MARY LOUISE KELLY, HOST: This is the week members of Congress voted almost unanimously to condemn their colleague, Steve King. The move was in response to the Iowa Republican's defense of the terms white nationalist and white supremacist in a New York Times interview. Now, as Iowa Public Radio's Katie Peikes reports, King's constituents in western Iowa are pondering his political future. KATIE PEIKES, BYLINE: It's breakfast time at the J&J Cafe in the northwest Iowa city of Le Mars. At a table, there's a group of friends who meet daily to settle the world's problems. Today, they're talking about Steve King. Dennis Asche and Dennis Toel have both voted for him in the past and say he's been treated unfairly. DENNIS TOEL: You know, there's no freedom of speech anymore. DENNIS ASCHE: That's why there's - that's why they started this country, freedom of speech, freedom of religion and all that stuff. And now you can't talk anymore. PEIKES: Two big Iowa newspapers have called on King to step down, but Asche says King should keep his seat. DENNIS ASCHE: Why? Because the voters, they put him in there, that's why. We voted him in there. PEIKES: But their friend, Walt Kleinhesselink, is not so sure. WALT KLEINHESSELINK: I think he's been in there plenty long. PEIKES: King has represented this corner of Iowa since 2003, easily winning re-election every time until last November. That's when his history of making racist remarks caught up with him, and he eked out a narrow win. About 20 miles away is Sioux County, where King got some of his strongest support last fall. At the Town Square Coffee House and Kitchen in Orange City, co-owner Steve Mahr says he voted for King in 2004, but now he wants King to go away. STEVE MAHR: He's made comments about my immigrant neighbors. He's made comments about the freedom of black people. He's made comments about the superiority of Western civilization over other cultures and civilizations. PEIKES: A couple of tables away, Bre Ellis says she agrees with King's strong anti-abortion positions and support for gun rights, but she doesn't like the terms King defended like white supremacist, white nationalist and Western civilization. BRE ELLIS: I think that, at one time, Western civilization was an OK term to use. But I think that now, times have changed. And when times change, you also need to change the way that you say things and do things and support things. PEIKES: After the New York Times interview ran, King said he condemned white nationalism and supremacy, although he insists he's still a defender of Western civilization. But in a sign that his support here may be ebbing, a prominent local Republican has announced plans to challenge King in the GOP primary next year. For NPR News, I'm Katie Peikes in Sioux City, Iowa.

            "article_content": "Democratic presidential candidates are speaking out about the recent mass shootings, criticizing President Trump's rhetoric as a contributing factor.  ARI SHAPIRO, HOST: The Democrats who want to replace President Trump have been outspoken about the mass shootings. They're talking about issues like gun control and also the role of the presidency in shaping the culture. NPR political correspondent Scott Detrow joins us from Des Moines, Iowa. Hi, Scott. SCOTT DETROW, BYLINE: Hey. Good afternoon. SHAPIRO: Democrats have disagreed with President Trump about a lot of things. What specifically is their focus in response to these shootings? DETROW: What's interesting is that the focus is not gun control, even as important as an issue as that is for Democrats. Instead, the focus is on the alleged anti-immigrant motivations of the El Paso shooting, pointing to similarities between that alleged manifesto and the language that President Trump uses, as well as his broader divisive language and frequent attacks on minority lawmakers and political opponents. Here's former vice president Joe Biden speaking today in Iowa. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) JOE BIDEN: We have a problem with this rising tide of supremacy, white supremacy in America, and we have a president who encourages and emboldens it. DETROW: And the specific focus from Biden and other Democrats is Trump's repeated warnings of an invasion of immigrants in the country illegally and those recent attacks on minority congresswomen last month that led to send her back chants at that rally. SHAPIRO: When you say attacks, you mean on Twitter - the insults that he was waging on Twitter and then also in speeches. DETROW: Right. SHAPIRO: The president said he was watching the speech that Joe Biden made in Iowa. Apparently, while travelling from Dayton to El Paso, it must have been on the TV in Air Force One. Trump dismissed it as boring. Biden has been very focused on Trump all along. Did we hear anything new from him today? DETROW: This was probably the most forceful and blunt that Biden has been in condemning Trump, saying again that he emboldens white nationalism, as we heard before. But again, this has also been a broader theme of Biden's campaign since the very beginning. He's running as someone - he's trying to frame himself as a person who can restore the normalcy of the presidency in the United States. And he often says, as he did today, that the soul of America is at stake in this election. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) BIDEN: Trump offers no moral leadership, seems to have no interest in unifying this nation - no evidence that the presidency has awakened his conscience in the least. Indeed, we have a president with a toxic tongue who has publicly and unapologetically embraced the political strategy of hate, racism and division. SHAPIRO: Scott, a lot of Democrats have said they don't want to fight this campaign on Trump's turf, which they see as cultural issues. They want to focus on policy issues like health care. Do the events of this past week show that that might be difficult for them? DETROW: Yeah, it's a tough, strategic spot. They wanted to make it about their ideas, but they still feel like they have to stand up and respond to things that they see as important. The flip side, of course, is that in moments like this, this broad field is all on the same page, as opposed to last week, where they were all arguing about health care and other policies. New Jersey Senator Cory Booker spoke today too in a symbolic spot - the Emanuel AME Church in Charleston, S.C., where a white supremacist shot nine African Americans in 2015. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) CORY BOOKER: As a political strategy, weaponizing hatred can be effective. It often seems easy. Generations of politicians have used fear of the other for political gain, and that is certainly the case today. DETROW: There's some concern from some Democratic strategists that just focusing on Trump's deficiencies could repeat the party's mistakes of 2016. But a lot of the campaigns argue that there's a big difference. And that is that the president now has had three years of a track record in the White House, and that makes voters more receptive, at least in these campaign's arguments, to this type of message. SHAPIRO: NPR's Scott Detrow. Thank you. DETROW: Thank you. (SOUNDBITE OF FILA BRAZILLIA'S \"A ZED AND TWO L'S\") Copyright \u00a9 2019 NPR.  All rights reserved.

            "article_content": "President Trump has ordered that the American flag be lowered at the White House, federal buildings and military installations in honor of the victims of this weekend's two mass shootings.  FRANCO ORDO\u00d1EZ, BYLINE: Thank you. : We heard from President Trump not long ago, and he had this to say. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: These are two incredible places. We love the people. Hate has no place in our country. : One of the things that stands - one of the reasons why that stands out is that many people are pointing the finger at President Trump's rhetoric. What has he said until now? ORDO\u00d1EZ: Well, he has said a lot. There's no question that the president has used inflammatory language about immigrants and people of color. I mean, we got to be clear. The shooter is the person with the ultimate responsibility. But there are legitimate questions about whether this president is fanning those flames with his language. He's characterized immigrants at the border as an invasion. He's also, you know, and a lot of people, not only Democrats, are saying that he could do more to call out white nationalists. Obviously, the most famous example being Charlottesville, where he said there were good people on both sides of that deadly clash. : So how is the White House responding to this charge that his rhetoric has contributed to shootings like the ones that we just saw? ORDO\u00d1EZ: Well, Chief of Staff Mick Mulvaney was on shows this morning defending the administration, defending the White House, saying Democrats like Swalwell, who we just heard, are trying to score political points on the tragedy, saying that about some of the other Democratic candidates who are still in the presidential race. Mulvaney himself is calling the shooter a sick person and says drawing anything other than that is wrong or fair - trying to blame the president is unfair. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) MICK MULVANEY: This was a sick person. The person in Dayton was a sick person. No politician is to blame for that. The people responsible here are the people who pulled the trigger. We need to figure out how to create less of those kinds of people as a society and not trying to figure out who gets blamed going into the next election. ORDO\u00d1EZ: And Trump himself, you know, at a rally in Charlotte last year, he said the White House didn't blame Bernie Sanders when one of his supporters went out and shot a Republican lawmaker during a baseball practice. They're saying they want the same type of response. : And where does the White House stand in terms of policy solutions? ORDO\u00d1EZ: Well, the president today said that the White House is talking to people. He said he talked to the attorney general, Bill Barr, and that they are looking at doing more, but he was not specific. He said they want to make a statement tomorrow at 10 a.m. about doing something. Again, he was not specific, did not give any details other than to say he - this is an issue about mental illness, which is something he's talked about before. The White House is also pointing out work they have done before about bump stocks bans and stronger background checks. But the White House probably needs to take on the NRA. This is an issue. The NRA is a big supporter of Trump, and Trump has been a big supporter of the NRA. He once flirted with going against them after the Parkland shooting, but he kind of backed off. Another issue is that, you know, he has - he is likely going to have to take a more direct push on white nationalism because until now, he has downplayed that threat. Even in March, when reporters asked him directly whether he saw white nationalism as a rising threat, he answered, I don't really, I think it's a small group of people that have a very serious problem. So there'll be more and more questions about that to him. : We're going to talk more about the issue of white nationalism in just a few minutes. That's NPR White House correspondent Franco Ordo\u00f1ez. Franco, thank you so much for talking with us. ORDO\u00d1EZ: Thank you. Copyright \u00a9 2019 NPR.  All rights reserved.

            "article_content": "The new season of the Netflix's wonderfully entertaining historical soap opera carries Queen Elizabeth II's story into the mid-1960s and '70s, when Britain's post-war afterglow has faded.  DAVID BIANCULLI, HOST: The new season of \"The Crown,\" which tells the ongoing story of the royal family during the reign of Queen Elizabeth II, is presented Sunday on Netflix. It features a new cast, including Oscar-winner Olivia Colman as Elizabeth. Our critic-at-large John Powers says that while the show has changed in many ways, what hasn't changed is that it's still so good. JOHN POWERS, BYLINE: I was once visiting Cambridge, England, when I saw crowds pouring into the city center. Joining the throng, I arrived in time to see an immaculately besuited Prince Charles give a speech that celebrated, of all things, the opening of a new supermarket. Watching him feign enthusiasm, I remember thinking, the poor guy spends his whole life doing this stuff, and I walked away grateful that I wasn't a royal. I suspect many feel the same gratitude watching \"The Crown,\" the plush behind-the-palace-walls hit that may be the most delicious series on television. Created and largely scripted by Peter Morgan, the show's third season drops on Netflix this Sunday, carrying Queen Elizabeth's story into the mid-1960s and '70s. While the essential drama at Buckingham Palace stays the same - it's the tug of war between public rules and private selves - Season 3 has big changes that take a couple of episodes to warm up to. It's not simply that we're watching once-youthful characters now congealed in cushy, but often disappointing, middle-aged malaise. We must also get used to a superb new cast, with Matt Smith's spiky Prince Philip giving way to Tobias Menzies' more textured annoyance - he's a reservoir of bad advice - and Vanessa Kirby's dazzling Princess Margaret turning into an unhappily married social butterfly, waspishly played by Helena Bonham Carter. Most important, Claire Foy's likeably hesitant Elizabeth has been replaced by a prematurely dowdy queen who, in Olivia Colman's layered performance, has warmed to her job. Beneath her sometimes lacquered exterior, she's an odd mixture of decency and coldness, cluelessness and ultimate good sense. Making matters still trickier, the show is no longer set in the postwar afterglow dominated by Winston Churchill. Largely ignoring the giddiness of swinging London, Morgan focuses on troubled times. Even as politicians ask whether the monarchy is a waste of time and money, Britain is faced with a shrinking pound sterling, massive strikes, calamitous power cuts and even the threat of a right-wing coup involving national luminaries. Here, on election day in 1964, Elizabeth watches the news while her husband fans absurd fears of what will happen should Labour's Harold Wilson become prime minister. (SOUNDBITE OF TV SHOW, \"THE CROWN\") TOBIAS MENZIES: (As Prince Philip) You do know if that man wins today, they'll want us out. OLIVIA COLMAN: (As Queen Elizabeth II) Who? MENZIES: (As Prince Philip) Wilson. Over half his cabinet would be made up of rabid anti-monarchists who want our heads on spikes. Vive la revolution, except I doubt they speak French in Halifax or Huddersfield - wherever he's from. JASON WATKINS: (As Harold Wilson, unintelligible). MENZIES: (As Prince Philip) I even heard a rumor that he's a KGB spy... COLMAN: (As Queen Elizabeth II) Mr. Wilson? That's ridiculous. MENZIES: (As Prince Philip) ...That his predecessor, Hugh Gaitskell, was poisoned by the Russians so that their man might take over. COLMAN: (As Queen Elizabeth II) Who did you hear that from? MENZIES: (As Prince Philip) A friend of mine at the lunch club. He had a whole theory about Wilson being turned while on a trade mission to Russia, said he even had a KGB codename - OLDING. COLMAN: (As Queen Elizabeth II) Well, if you know it and your chum knows it, obviously, MI5 will know it, and they must've come to the conclusion Mr. Wilson was fine or they would've done something about it. MENZIES: (As Prince Philip) Well, unless they never expected him to get this far. No one did. POWERS: As it happens, ideology proves irrelevant. Over a series of nifty scenes, Elizabeth comes to develop a close relationship with Wilson, slyly played by Jason Watkins, who talks to her forthrightly about governing. She vastly prefers him to his feckless Tory successor Edward Heath, who she finds about as appealing as a tree slug. \"The Crown\" gets much of its oomph from filtering historical events through their often-tangential connection to the royal family. Thus, a mining disaster becomes the story of Elizabeth's trouble displaying public empathy, a preview of her PR disaster with Princess Di. Britain's need for an American loan leads to a drunken Princess Margaret spouting dirty limericks to a delighted Lyndon Johnson. And in a sneakily powerful episode, the fear of Welsh nationalism leads the family to uproot Prince Charles, played with great feeling by Josh O'Connor, and ship him to the University of Wales in Aberystwyth to prove the English care. Along the way, Charles becomes this season's prime sacrificial victim, where his sister Princess Anne, played with star-making assurance by Erin Doherty, listens to David Bowie, enjoys casual flings and addresses the world with biting sarcasm. The touching Charles believes himself a kind of individualistic freethinker, but whether it's his schooling or his love life, he's bulldozed into doing what his chilly, stiff-upper-lip family decides is best for the Crown. His whole purpose in life is to become king when his mother dies. Now 71, he's still in that limbo, more a figure of mockery than sympathy. \"The Crown\" is wonderfully entertaining, in part because we don't have to take it all that seriously. Because the throne has no real power, we can enjoy it as a historical soap opera without worrying that things are inaccurate or partisan as we would with a show about, say, the Kennedys or the Trumps. Indeed, one key to the monarchy's allure is that it offers a kind of larger-than-life pop mythology. In its timeless pageantry and out-of-touch silliness, \"The Crown\" transcends the moment. It represents the idea of an enduring Britain, and it provides ordinary people with a useful distraction from the battles of political life. I never thought I'd say this, but these days, maybe America could use a royal family, too.

            "article_content": "Israel says it won't allow Congresswomen Ilhan Omar and Rashida Tlaib to enter the country for a trip they have planned for this weekend.  MARY LOUISE KELLY, HOST: Israel is barring two freshman Democratic congresswomen from entering the country. Both Minnesota's Ilhan Omar and Michigan's Rashida Tlaib have been critical of Israel's policies. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu made the decision after President Trump tweeted his thoughts on the matter. Trump said it would show great weakness if Israel were to let the two lawmakers go on a trip they had planned for this weekend. We will hear reaction from a Democratic lawmaker in Congress in a moment. First, let's go to Jerusalem and NPR's Daniel Estrin. Hey, Daniel. DANIEL ESTRIN, BYLINE: Hi, Mary Louise. KELLY: Why is Israel saying it banned this visit by Tlaib and Omar? ESTRIN: Well, Netanyahu said that Israeli law allows authorities to bar entry to people who advocate a global movement to boycott Israel. And he said these congresswomen were going to do just that. They were going to use the trip to promote a boycott of Israel. Now, these Congresswomen do support the right to boycott Israel. They are outspoken critics of Israel. Tlaib has talked about Israel's, quote, \"racist policies.\" The question here is, why this Israeli decision now to ban them? - because last month, Israel said it would let them in out of respect for Congress. It seems that the deciding factor here was Trump. He has singled out these Congresswomen before. He has tried to paint them as the face of the Democratic Party, although many Democrats distanced themselves from these congresswomen's positions on Israel. KELLY: Right, as you say, they have been outspoken for a long time, so the timing is a question. What do they say about what they were going to do when they got there? What was the trip supposed to be? ESTRIN: Well, I spoke with a group associated with a Palestinian official. This group was organizing the trip, and they say that the congresswomen were going to be visiting Jerusalem and three Palestinian cities in the West Bank. And one of the organizers told me that the congresswomen wanted to see the impact of U.S. policies on Palestinians, so they were going to visit a Jerusalem hospital that was affected by the Trump administration's funding cuts for Palestinians. They were going to visit Israeli and Palestinian human rights activists, Palestinian youth and also visit the Al-Aqsa Mosque in Jerusalem. And Tlaib has a grandmother in the West Bank, and she was going to be visiting her and other relatives there. KELLY: And the trip is now definitely off. ESTRIN: That's what the congresswomen are signaling, yes. KELLY: What else are they saying? Have they reacted to this move by Israel today? ESTRIN: They have. Congresswoman Omar said Israel was imposing a Muslim ban. Both congresswomen are Muslim. And Tlaib tweeted a photo of her Palestinian grandmother. And she said that Israel banning her was a sign of weakness. And actually, several pro-Israel groups have also opposed this Israeli move. AIPAC, for instance, said it believes that U.S. representatives should be able to visit and experience Israel firsthand, even though the group disagrees with the congresswomen's views on Israel. KELLY: So help us understand, Daniel, what else might be going on behind the scenes here. Just describe what the domestic political challenges that Benjamin Netanyahu is facing are. ESTRIN: Yeah. He faces a lot of domestic political challenges because he's headed for a redo election next month. He is in a weakened position at the moment. He did not manage to form a government after last elections. And right now he has right-wing competitors who are posing a challenge. So going into this election, he wants to make sure he stays the leader of the right wing. And he wants to prove his nationalism. But part of that calculation is that he needs Trump. Last election season, Trump helped Netanyahu a lot. He invited Netanyahu to the White House. He recognized Israel's annexation of the Golan Heights. That helped Netanyahu win voters last time. And now many Israelis are expecting that Trump will offer Netanyahu some goodies this time too. KELLY: NPR's Daniel Estrin reporting on a very complicated back and forth going on there. He's in Jerusalem. Daniel, thank you. ESTRIN: You're welcome. Copyright \u00a9 2019 NPR.  All rights reserved.

            "article_content": "This year marked a turning point in how the United States confronts domestic terrorism. The country began taking far-right extremism seriously amid a resurgence of white nationalist violence.  AILSA CHANG, HOST: This year marked a turning point in how the nation confronts domestic terrorism. It's a big shift for a national security apparatus that's been focused almost exclusively on Islamist extremism since the 9/11 attacks. But now the focus is on homegrown extremism, amid a resurgence of white nationalist and other far-right violence. NPR's Hannah Allam joins us now to talk about the past year and what to watch for next year as the threat evolves. Hey, Hannah. HANNAH ALLAM, BYLINE: Hi, there. CHANG: So what do you think has changed in how this country thinks about and talks about violent extremism? ALLAM: Well, it's not like there's been an overnight shift where everybody was worried about ISIS and now we're worried about white power groups. It's definitely more gradual and subtle than that, but there has been a change. If we back up to 2017, the white nationalist rally in Charlottesville, Va., was a wake-up call about how racial hatred was moving into organized violence. So 2019 was the year we've seen that awareness translate into action. We've seen congressional hearings, draft legislation, new law enforcement efforts and really just a wider understanding now that homegrown far-right militancy is a threat that's on par with or even bigger than the threat from Islamist extremists, at least here in the U.S. CHANG: OK. Then how has the response from law enforcement evolved? ALLAM: For years, far-right extremists have been the deadlier and more active threat to the United States. And now we're hearing officials say that publicly and acknowledge that in stark terms. In May, the head of the FBI's counterterrorism division testified that they're investigating 850 domestic terrorism cases. CHANG: Wow. ALLAM: Yeah. About 40% of those involved racially motivated violence, mostly by white supremacists. In July, the FBI director, Christopher Wray, said the same thing at another congressional hearing. So 2019 - we are seeing a change in the conversation. And sadly, it's a conversation we've been forced to have. It seems like a long time ago now because of the pace of the news cycle. But if we just think back to some of the attacks of 2019, we saw white supremacists attack Muslims in New Zealand, attack a synagogue in Poway, Calif., Latinos at a Walmart in El Paso, among many other incidents. And that level of violence - it's impossible to ignore now. CHANG: Yeah. So given that law enforcement has identified this as a specific threat, what is being done? ALLAM: We have seen some movement in a number of places. This past year, there were at least four congressional hearings on the far-right threat and white nationalist violence. Some of those committees were discussing this issue for the first time. We saw the Department of Homeland Security, DHS, unveil a strategic plan that squarely targets far-right extremism, and that comes after years of focusing almost exclusively on jihadists. And the plan came with an introduction that said, as the threats evolve, we must do so as well. We also saw the NYPD, the nation's biggest police department - just this month, it opened a new intelligence unit dedicated to policing extremist hate groups. CHANG: Oh, interesting. ALLAM: And even at universities, on the academic front, academics across the country who study the far-right threat just formed a collective. They are - said that they felt compelled to better teach the public about the dangers of what happens when these fringe movements move closer into the mainstream. CHANG: But what about the White House? I mean, President Trump came under a lot of criticism after the white nationalist rally in Charlottesville in 2017 when he said there were, quote, \"very fine people on both sides.\" Has his language changed any since Charlottesville when it comes to white nationalism? ALLAM: Right. It's still a mixed bag with Trump. His own federal agencies say the far-right threat's a priority, but the president hasn't always been as clear. Early in the year, after the mass killing of Muslims in New Zealand, Trump was asked whether he thought white nationalism was a growing threat. He said he didn't. He played it down. So that was March. Fast-forward to August and the attack on Latinos in El Paso, and he sounded a different tune, as we hear in this clip. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: The shooter in El Paso posted a manifesto online consumed by racist hate. In one voice, our nation must condemn racism, bigotry and white supremacy. These sinister ideologies must be defeated. Hate has no place in America. CHANG: He's sounding very different notes than he did during Charlottesville. ALLAM: I think anyone would say that's an unusually forceful and unequivocal rejection of white racial violence coming from this president. CHANG: So Hannah, as we are heading into 2020, I'm curious - what do you think you will be watching for next year? ALLAM: Well, first of all, I'll be watching for follow-through on those pledges to take this issue more seriously, including the White House and Congress. And we can't forget that it's an election year. Historically, there's always a rise in hate crimes in an election year, so I'll be looking at those divisions and whether we see them spilling into the streets. We're already hearing extremists pledge to fight against red flag laws and other efforts at gun control. It's hard to know how seriously to take some of these factions, but some are threatening armed rebellion. CHANG: That's NPR's Hannah Allam. Thank you, Hannah. ALLAM: Thank you.

            "article_content": "President Trump calls for urgent resolve in trying to prevent massacres like the ones we saw in El Paso, Texas and Dayton, Ohio over the weekend.  RACHEL MARTIN, HOST: President Trump calls for urgent resolve in trying to prevent massacres like the ones we saw in El Paso, Texas, and Dayton, Ohio, over the weekend. Twenty-nine people were killed in two shootings that occurred just hours apart. The first was in El Paso at a Walmart. Just hours later, a gunman opened fire in a popular nightlife district in Dayton, Ohio. Police are treating the El Paso shooting as an act of domestic terrorism. Authorities also believe the suspect in that shooting posted an anti-immigration statement before the attack. Here's what President Trump had to say about that at the White House this morning. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: The shooter in El Paso posted a manifesto online consumed by racist hate. In one voice, our nation must condemn racism, bigotry and white supremacy. These sinister ideologies must be defeated. Hate has no place in America. Hatred warps the mind, ravages the heart and devours the soul. MARTIN: NPR White House correspondent Tamara Keith and political correspondent Scott Detrow join us to talk more about the president's remarks. Tam, I want to start with you. We heard there a clip - President Trump condemning white supremacy outright, calling it an ideology that that must be defeated. This is the first time we've heard the president use that kind of language, is it not? TAMARA KEITH, BYLINE: The president has over his presidency struggled to in a very clear way condemn white supremacy. After the march in Charlottesville, the white supremacist march that resulted in the death of a counter-protester, the president really did not say the words that (laughter) - what he actually said was that there were fine people on both sides, very fine people. And that is something that he has not been able to live down. You know, what the FBI said about the El Paso attack was that it underscores the continued threat posed by domestic violent extremists and perpetrators of hate crimes. In that manifesto that you referenced, the alleged shooter used terms that are very similar to terms that president himself has used. The term invasion - here is President Trump at at a rally in Florida earlier this year talking about immigrants as invaders of this country. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) TRUMP: When you see these caravans starting out with 20,000 people, that's an invasion. I was badly criticized for using the word invasion. It's an invasion, and it's also an invasion of drugs coming in from Mexico. OK? It's an invasion of drugs. (CHEERING) TRUMP: They all better be careful because, you know, we're destroying the lives of hundreds of thousands of people a year with the drugs that are pouring across our southern border. They better damn well be careful. MARTIN: So we hear there the president using that terminology invasion that's what we saw, as you note, Tam, in the language of this so-called manifesto posted by the El Paso shooter. And while, you know, we should just acknowledge that, in that same manifesto, the alleged shooter says that his sentiments towards immigrants predates Donald Trump as president of the United States, at the same time, this president is known for retweeting, amplifying voices online that are divisive and racist, outright racist. KEITH: Yeah, he has. In his remarks, the president talked about the need to go into the dark recesses of the internet and find people and prevent them from committing such crimes in the future. And he talked about the problems that exist in these dark recesses of the internet. The president himself has retweeted or tweeted out memes and videos that have come from those very same dark recesses. But what his supporters would say, and what White House officials say, is that the president's rhetoric is one thing, but he didn't pull the trigger, that the people who are responsible for these shootings are the people who are responsible for these shootings, not rhetoric coming from the president of the United States. MARTIN: Scott, Democrats have been very blunt about placing blame on President Trump and his rhetoric around immigration. SCOTT DETROW, BYLINE: Yeah. As the campaign has gone on, Democrats have become increasingly showing no reservation about saying the president is a racist, that he is running a re-election campaign based on stirring up us-versus-them sentiments. That's become a common theme from many of the Democrats running for president, which is really remarkable. But this really increased again in the wake of these shootings and especially the alleged anti-immigrant motivations from the El Paso shooter. Here's Elizabeth Warren speaking to MSNBC this weekend. (SOUNDBITE OF MSNBC BROADCAST) ELIZABETH WARREN: The president has embraced white nationalists. He has encouraged white nationalists. He is there with white nationalism. When white nationalists embrace him and call him their friend, you know, I take them at their word on that. DETROW: So again, I think that's why it's notable, as Tam was mentioning before, that the president did condemn white nationalism in unqualified language earlier today. You've heard similar statements like Warren's from many other candidates. And a lot of people are pointing to that same rally that we heard from the president a few moments ago from this moment that happened at that rally. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) TRUMP: But how do you stop these people? UNIDENTIFIED PERSON: Shoot them. TRUMP: You can't. There's no... (LAUGHTER) TRUMP: That's only in the Panhandle you can get away with that statement. DETROW: And that pause was someone yelling up on the stage, shoot them. And the president responded in that joking manner. MARTIN: So he had said, what are you going to do about these people? And someone in the crowd says, you shoot them. DETROW: Yeah. MARTIN: It's hard to find words after that when you think about the tragedies that unfolded over the weekend. Tam, let's talk about what the president calls an urgent need to prevent massacres like this from happening. What does that mean? I mean, did we get any concrete announcements from the president today? KEITH: Yeah, he spoke a lot about mental health, which is something that he has focused on again and again after mass shootings. Democrats tend to, after these events, focus on gun laws, on restricting access to high-capacity magazines and on tightening background checks. And in his remarks, President Trump didn't mention guns really in any way except to say that it isn't the gun that kills someone. It's the mental ill - the mentally ill person with the gun that kills people. What he did call for were so-called red flag laws. And here's a little bit of that tape. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) TRUMP: We must make sure that those judged to pose a grave risk to public safety do not have access to firearms and that, if they do, those firearms can be taken through rapid due process. That is why I have called for red flag laws, also known as extreme risk protection orders. KEITH: And this is something that his allies, including his daughter, Ivanka Trump, and also South Carolina Senator Lindsey Graham, have endorsed. One thing that is notable, however, is that earlier this morning, President Trump tweeted that he thought that there should be stronger background checks for guns. Then, when he went to deliver his remarks that he read from a teleprompter and a prepared speech, there was no mention of that at all. MARTIN: He also tweeted out early this morning that he thought that some kind of legislation that would tie immigration reform to tighter gun control or background checks, rather, was something that should be considered. And that didn't come up in the scripted remarks, did it? KEITH: No, and it's also somewhat mind-boggling suggestion, just given the politics of the last decade or decades, even. Immigration reform is something that has been utterly intractable. Gun violence prevention and gun control legislation has also been intractable. The last major bipartisan effort was in 2013, and that failed in the Senate. And so also to have him then trying to link gun legislation to immigration reform after a shooting where the alleged shooter says he was inspired by concerns about immigrants coming into the country... MARTIN: Right, where immigrants were the target. KEITH: It's just a very strange - yeah, it's a - and where immigrants were the target, it's a very strange connection for the president to make. MARTIN: Scott, when we talk about these red flag laws, just remind us where the debate is in Congress when it comes to gun control. DETROW: Sure. Well, the first - for the first time in years, a chamber of Congress has actually passed gun control legislation. Earlier this year, the Democrat-controlled House of Representatives did pass a couple background check bills. They went to the Senate. You know, Democrats for years were wary of gun control measures. That has really gone away, and now a lot of Democrats campaign on it. In fact, gun control measures have become a big part of the platform of a lot of the presidential candidates. But the Senate is controlled by Republicans, and Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has made it clear he has no intention of calling a vote on these bills. There wouldn't be the votes to pass them anyway, based on the makeup of the Senate right now and where Republican senators have stood on similar measures before. You know, I think so many mass shootings happened at - now that it's really hard to see which ones will just kind of come and go without a political moment and which ones will cause some pressure for lawmakers to act. I was at one of these first big events where all of the Democratic candidates come and speak, and it was the day after that Virginia Beach shooting a few months ago. MARTIN: Right. DETROW: And it struck me that in a room of people who all agree on gun control, one of - I think it was - 11 candidates felt compelled to even mention the shooting that had happened 24 hours before. Obviously, two shootings in the span of 24 hours has heightened this moment. I think you could see some political pressure. One thing that I'm thinking of is that moment that we were reporting on earlier today, that vigil in Dayton... MARTIN: Yeah. DETROW: ...When the Republican governor was speaking, and the crowd started to chant, do something. MARTIN: Do something, right. DETROW: Of course, Congress is gone for the next month, so it's hard to see momentum building. Democrats want McConnell to come back and reconvene the Senate - very unlikely that'll happen. MARTIN: Tam, any closing thoughts about either the president's performance today or where the debate goes from here? KEITH: This debate is going to continue, and I think there's also going to be a big debate about whether the president coming out one time and condemning white supremacy is enough. MARTIN: NPR White House correspondent Tamara Keith, also NPR political correspondent Scott Detrow for us. Thanks to you both. DETROW: Sure thing. KEITH: You're welcome.

            "article_content": "New York Times reporter Andrew Kramer says impeachment puts Volodymyr Zelenskiy in a tough spot: \"He may be dealing with a President Biden next year, or he may be dealing with President Trump.\"  TERRY GROSS, HOST: This is FRESH AIR. I'm Terry Gross. A curious feature of the impeachment drama unfolding in Washington is that so much of it has to do with Ukraine, a former Soviet republic that's been independent for just 28 years. President Trump and his lawyer Rudy Giuliani have sought to get Ukraine's government to investigate Joe Biden's son Hunter's business dealings. And Trump asked Ukraine's new president to investigate a discredited theory that Ukraine was involved in the 2016 hack of the Democratic National Committee's emails. We're going to take a closer look at Ukraine and how players in its own turbulent politics have interacted with American actors in the impeachment saga. Our guest is Andrew Kramer, a reporter for The New York Times who's based in Moscow and has been reporting on Ukraine for several years. In 2017, he shared a Pulitzer Prize with his Times colleagues for an investigative series on Russia's use of covert means to exert its power. Andrew Kramer spoke to FRESH AIR's Dave Davies yesterday from a studio in Kyiv. DAVE DAVIES, HOST: Andrew Kramer, welcome to FRESH AIR. You know, Ukraine's been an independent country just since 1991, and it hasn't exactly been a smooth transition. And reading about the events in recent years - gosh, lots of tales of corruptions, of oligarchs being connected to politicians, of prosecutions that, in some cases, maybe seem politically connected - everybody has an angle, it seems. And I wonder if you could just - could you talk a bit about Kyiv, what it's like and what it's like reporting there. ANDREW KRAMER: Kyiv is a beautiful city. It has cobblestone streets, old quarters on bluffs overlooking the Dnieper River. It's also a city that, in recent years, has been the equivalent of some of the Cold War dens of intrigue like Berlin, or maybe you might compare it to Casablanca in World War II, a city that's in between two forces, between two struggling or competing political systems. So you have spies, agents, journalists of Russia and of the West all active in this city. DAVIES: And it's got to be hard to figure out when you're getting the real story, I mean - right (laughter)? KRAMER: Well, that's certainly the case. There's been a lot of misinformation in Ukraine, not least because Ukraine has been on the frontlines of some of the Russian disinformation activities in recent years. But it's also been a place for spin doctors from the West and Ukraine's own oligarchs and politicians who are presenting different narratives about this country's future and how this country should interact with the West. And it's actually these competing narratives which is part of the story behind the impeachment inquiry in the United States now. DAVIES: Ukraine is a pretty large country - 42 million people - historically dominated by Russia, at least in recent decades, but in the past by other empires. And now there are connections with the West and ambitions among Ukrainian politicians for closer ties to the United States and Western countries. How does Ukraine's geopolitical position affect its domestic politics? KRAMER: Well, that's really a pivotal issue in Ukraine's domestic politics, is the clashing geopolitical ambitions of countries around Ukraine. And it's not a new story for this country. When modern Ukraine was formed in the 17th century on the steppe land between the - Western Europe and the Russian Empire, it was already being pulled in both directions. We see this in the 20th century, and we see it again in the 21st century. When Ukraine gained independence in 1991, it was closely linked to Russia. There were industrial supply chains that linked Ukraine to Russia, energy pipelines. And Europe was pulling Ukraine away from the former Soviet Union, from the former Soviet space. And at the same time, Russia was pulling back. And it was this clash and this struggle for Ukraine that really defined its foreign policy and also its domestic policy of the past 30 years. DAVIES: Right. And then it's, in recent years, moved more to the West and has looked for friends and allies in the U.S. and other countries. Does that help explain why operatives like Paul Manafort could become so active and Hunter Biden might end up on the board of a gas company? KRAMER: Well, that's exactly right. You have ambitious actors in Ukraine, oligarchs and politicians who are looking for patrons in the West, particularly after the 2014 revolution but also before then, and willing to pay large sums of money to align themselves with lobbyists or politicians in the United States. And we saw this famously with Paul Manafort, but also Rudolph Giuliani has taken contracts from Ukrainian oligarchs, Hunter Biden. Donald Trump was paid $150,000 by a Ukrainian oligarch to give a speech in 2015. Hillary Clinton for the Clinton Foundation also accepted money from that oligarch. So a lot of western figures have found a source of profit in Ukraine and have chosen these wealthy Ukrainians as their guides to the country and, in exchange for money, accepted some of their narrative and their ideas of - about what Ukraine should become. And this is the backdrop to what's happening today. DAVIES: So let's talk about some of the recent history. In 2014, there were street demonstrations and clashes which resulted in the departure of the president then, Viktor Yanukovych. Tell us about him, what kind of a - what kind of regime he ran. KRAMER: Well, certainly. Viktor Yanukovych was a politician who was allied with Russia but also, like many Ukrainian politicians, was trying to straddle the fence. He had entered negotiations on trade agreements both with Russia and with the European Union. And this came to a head in 2013 when he realized he wouldn't be able to sign these agreements with both camps, with both the European Union and with Russia. And after initially promising his people, promising that he would integrate Ukraine economically with the European Union, at the very last moment he switched and made a trade agreement with Russia, which was part of a larger political project of Vladimir Putin to reintegrate parts of the former Soviet Union in what became known as the Eurasian Union (ph). Street protests broke out against this policy, and they snowballed into ever larger protests on Independence Square until February of 2014, when police opened fire into the crowd. There was in fact shooting on both sides, but a lot of protesters bore the brunt of this violence. And about 70 people were killed in the space of an hour and a half or so on Independence Square, and thousands were wounded over several days. This resulted in Yanukovych fleeing Kyiv when his police deserted him and departing for Moscow and leaving a power vacuum in the Ukrainian capital that was only gradually filled first over weeks and then over months with a new government that was propped up by the United States. DAVIES: And when demonstrators reached the residence that Yanukovych had inhabited and got inside, what did they find? KRAMER: Well, I was with the demonstrators who came in. It was a foggy morning in late February. And some of them climbed over a gate and then broke it open. And you had a - really a view of opulence that was almost unimaginable for most Ukrainians - a private golf course, a collection of antique cars, a zoo with ostriches and a number of other luxuries. But intriguingly, also what they found were documents floating in a river harbor and some documents which had been partly burned. And it was these documents that were never meant to come to the surface, never meant to be seen by the public, that really were a ticking time bomb for the intersection of Ukrainian politics and U.S. politics because hidden in this collection of documents, found not just at the residence but also on the floor of a sauna of a former prosecutor and in a safe in the former political party of Mr. Yanukovych, were details of Paul Manafort's work in Ukraine. DAVIES: Manafort had helped Yanukovych get power and then was still active in Ukraine after Yanukovych left when remnants of his party remained active. Tell us about what these documents said and what impact they had on Paul Manafort and the Trump campaign. KRAMER: Well, certainly - it turned out that the most extensive records of Manafort's activities in Ukraine were included in the handwritten accounting documents kept by the Party of Regions, the party of former President Yanukovych. And they included payments designated for Manafort for things like polling, for even overhead items like computers for his office, as well as payments for his consulting services over several years, totaling $12.7 million. These were off-the-book payments and were considered illegal in Ukraine. And when we wrote about this in August of 2016, Manafort and his attorneys denied that this could be the case and suggested the documents were forged. But there was a lot of confidence that, in fact, they were not, and we published the story. And Manafort resigned from the campaign about a week later. DAVIES: And just to kind of set the context here, this is Viktor Yanukovych, who lived in opulence in what was regarded as, you know, riches essentially stolen from the Ukrainian people. He was a pro-Russian president. He flees, and then it's in the records of his party that you find these secret payments to Manafort - not at all helpful to the Trump campaign. Is this part of the origin of Trump's belief that Ukrainians were always out to get him and help Hillary Clinton? KRAMER: I think so. You saw now in the most recent episodes involving Ukraine, when Trump released the transcript of his call with the Ukrainian president, he was talking about bad things that happened in Ukraine and things that our country, meaning America, went through because of Ukraine. Also, we know from some of the interviews and testimony of diplomats and aides to President Trump in the inquiry - the impeachment inquiry that Trump had said that Ukraine tried to take him down in 2016. And most of this feeling, most of this impression, I believe is related to the disclosures of financial wrongdoing by his campaign chairman, Paul Manafort, which was a blow to the Trump campaign in August of 2016. DAVIES: You know, when you look at events in Ukraine, it seems that high-profile prosecutions are pretty common. Have they become just an accepted weapon in political competition there? KRAMER: Well, when protesters took to the streets of Kyiv in 2014, the politicized use of the prosecutor's office was one of the issues that they were protesting against. One of the symbols of the uprising on Independence Square was a poster showing the face of a former prime minister. Yulia Tymoshenko is best known in the West for her long, blonde braid. She was imprisoned by the president at the time, Viktor Yanukovych. Ms. Tymoshenko had run against Yanukovych in 2010 and lost. And then soon after the election, she was locked up in prison on charges which were widely seen as political and had been in jail for several years by the time that protests came about. But it was a poignant symbol of the type of problem in their government that was upsetting protesters. DAVIES: What were the charges against Tymoshenko, this woman who ran against Yanukovych? KRAMER: Tymoshenko was charged and convicted with exceeding her authority in negotiating a natural gas deal with Russia. The accusation was that, as prime minister, she could not give a direct order to the head of the government-controlled natural gas company but rather, this order needed to come via the energy ministry. So it was a very technical administrative issue of Ukrainian governance that was used as a criminal case against her. And she was convicted to five or six years in prison on this issue, which was generally seen as political pretext for a political prosecution to remove her from political life and put her in jail. DAVIES: And Andrew Kramer is a reporter for The New York Times based in Moscow. We'll talk some more after a short break. This is FRESH AIR. (SOUNDBITE OF AARON PARKS' \"SMALL PLANET\") DAVIES: This is FRESH AIR, and we're talking about Ukraine, it's history, politics and its connections to the impeachment inquiry unfolding in Washington with Andrew Kramer. He's a reporter for The New York Times based in Moscow. He's covered events in Ukraine for the past several years. So, Andrew Kramer, when did Rudy Giuliani, the president's personal lawyer, start working in Ukraine to get authorities interested in investigating matters of interest to the president? KRAMER: Well, to the best of our understanding, this began in 2018, perhaps late 2018, when he reached out to the prosecutor general of Ukraine, Yuriy Lutsenko or alternatively, by another version, Mr. Lutsenko reached out to him, and they discussed two cases which could be politically useful to Donald Trump in the 2020 election in United States. This was an investigation relevant to the former Vice President Joe Biden and his son Hunter Biden and what's been called by Trump administration officials a look back at 2016, which is an investigation into whether Ukraine meddled in the U.S. election in 2016 to favor Hillary rather than Russia meddling to favor Trump. DAVIES: Right. Now, while Giuliani is busy doing what he can to make contact there, there is an election this spring. The incumbent president then, Petro Poroshenko, found himself in trouble when seeking reelection. Why? KRAMER: Well, Poroshenko was admired when he came into office. But patience had quickly run out with his stalling on reform and his embrace of a very hardline form of Ukrainian nationalism, which he ran on in the election. So Poroshenko came into the election with very low poll ratings and was searching around for, perhaps, some help and maybe even backing from the United States. Maybe he wanted an endorsement from President Trump before the election. And this outreach and interaction between Giuliani and his own prosecutor occurred with the backdrop of the Ukrainian election taking place. DAVIES: Ukraine gets a new president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, an interesting character. Tell us about him. KRAMER: Sure. Zelenskiy was a TV actor in Ukraine. And he emerged in the 1990s in comedy shows, which are called the \"Club Of The Merry And The Inventive\" (ph) - something like this - which are kind of a - something of a combination between \"Jeopardy!\" where you have to answer trivia questions and a standup routine. And then you're graded - each team is graded on how they do. And he was very successful, as a teenager and then as a young adult, playing in these competitions. And then he became a comedic actor, was popular throughout the former Soviet Union and in the entire Russian-speaking world for comedy sketches and also for movies and TV shows. In maybe 2015 - not sure, exactly, when the show began or when the taping of it began, but he initiated a program which was a parody of post-revolution Ukraine about how the political system after the revolution had not, in fact, reformed, that the same trends of corruption were present that were there before the revolution. And he played a teacher who had become - almost by accident, become president of Ukraine. And he played this through several series. It was very popular, playing a sort of a naive, everyman version of Ukraine's president before he became exactly that this year. DAVIES: Yeah. And this is so remarkable. I mean, he was actually taping a new season of it while he was campaigning for president, right? KRAMER: Yeah. That's right. That's what he was doing. Now, at this point, it looks a little bit less interesting and curious and more like a ploy to get around some restrictions on using TV advertising. Because this show was aired during the campaign and yet was presented as if it was an artistic product. And many of his ideas of the campaign were also included in the latest show. But that's exactly what happened. He continued the show right up to the moment when he was actually elected president. DAVIES: And the name of the show was \"Servant Of The People.\" And there were campaign advertisements which incorporated the title of the TV series into the campaign material, right? KRAMER: That's right. And his political party is called the Servant of the People. DAVIES: Zelenskiy is Jewish. Is that significant in any way? KRAMER: Yes. I think it certainly is. Zelenskiy ran on a different message about what it means to be Ukrainian. The previous president had promoted an idea of Ukrainian nationalism as tied to the Ukrainian language, the Ukrainian Orthodox Church, and Ukrainian identity as really one of faith and blood and soil. And Zelenskiy had a different view of what Ukrainian means, an understanding of Ukrainian in the current context as a country that supports freedom, that supports democracy, that is an inclusive identity about a political point of view rather than an ethnic or linguistic identity so that you could be Russian speaking, as Zelenskiy himself was. You can be Jewish, you can be Hungarian or any other minority in Ukraine and no less of a Ukrainian. And this was a message that a majority of Ukrainians accepted when he came in. His political party, the Servant of the People, put on its party list the first black Ukrainian who won a seat in parliament, which is another view of what it means to be Ukrainian. It can be - you can be an immigrant and also be a Ukrainian. DAVIES: Did Zelenskiy win by a large majority in the election? KRAMER: He did. He won in a landslide, with more than 70% of Ukrainians voting for him in all regions, in the east and also in the west, in Ukrainian-speaking areas and in Russian-speaking areas. DAVIES: Does he remain popular? KRAMER: He is popular. DAVIES: And why was he popular in Russian-speaking areas? KRAMER: Well, he was popular because he wasn't denigrating their experience. He wasn't telling them that their beliefs, what they had in their head, the language they spoke, was mush and that they should become Ukrainian in the sense of speaking Ukrainian, the Ukrainian language, and not appreciating their own cultural identity. Perhaps as Russian-speaking Jews, for example, living in Ukraine, this would be valued. And this was a message which even Ukrainians in western Ukraine appreciated and also in Russian-speaking areas. DAVIES: And the fictional character that he plays is successful in part because he confronts oligarchs and battles corruption, right, and promises to bring a new era of clean politics? So he wins office. How clean is he? KRAMER: Well, a lot of the diplomatic community in Kyiv and analysts are looking closely at that question and are willing to give Zelenskiy the benefit of the doubt for now. His stated positions are positive. The real dramatic question which is hanging over the Zelenskiy administration now is his relationship with an oligarch named Igor Kolomoisky, who was the owner of the television station where his show had aired, and he was a business partner with Zelenskiy. Kolomoisky had been an exile until the election. He just recently returned to Ukraine and has now been involved in influencing the Zelenskiy government to the extent that the International Monetary Fund has declined to offer its latest aid package. So in domestic politics, the question of whether the TV character is similar to the real-life president is really the open question here, whether he will confront the oligarchic class, in particular, somebody deemed his patron, or whether it won't be so much life imitating art as just life continuing on as usual in Ukraine. GROSS: We're listening to the interview FRESH AIR's Dave Davies recorded with Andrew Kramer, a reporter for The New York Times, based in Moscow. After a break, he'll tell us more about Ukraine's actor-turned-president and about visiting the frontlines of the war in Eastern Ukraine. Also, Ken Tucker will review the new album by country singer Jon Pardi, who Ken says is making excellent honky-tonk music. And Justin Chang will review Martin Scorsese's new film \"The Irishman.\" I'm Terry Gross, and this is FRESH AIR. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) GROSS: This is FRESH AIR. I'm Terry Gross. We're listening to the interview Dave Davies recorded with New York Times reporter Andrew Kramer about Ukraine and the role the country and its politicians have played in the events leading to the impeachment inquiry into Donald Trump. Kramer was in a studio in Kyiv. When they left off, they were talking about Ukraine's new president Volodymyr Zelensky, a former comedian and actor. DAVIES: Actors getting into politics is not unheard of. You know, Ronald Reagan was an actor, although he had been governor of a large state before he entered the White House. Trump, of course, was a reality show host, although he had a business career before that. Zelensky really has just been an actor - right? - and a comedian. KRAMER: That's right. He has no government experience before being elected president. He's 41 years old. There's one distinction here in Ukraine, which is that this is a country at war. It's not, perhaps, a time to be experimenting, or that's how Ukrainians view this. And so while Zelensky came in as a comedian, in office, he's been not nearly as lighthearted as he was as a character in his television show. The war has now been going on for five years. At least 13,000 people have been killed in the fighting in eastern Ukraine. And this was - along with fighting corruption and freeing the country from oligarchic influences, finding a peace settlement in the war in eastern Ukraine was a priority of Zelensky when he came in and was the reason why he was so eager to have a White House meeting with President Trump - because he wanted the United States to take a more active role in the diplomatic settlement process with Russia to pressure Russia to end the war. DAVIES: Right. And we haven't mentioned this in this interview, but yeah, that - around the time that Russia annexed Crimea, its agents were in - fighting in eastern Ukraine and have occupied parts of the country. And so there's an ongoing conflict there. KRAMER: Well, that's right, and that's an interesting - also an interesting point because the West and Western governments have correctly been pressuring Ukraine to solve these problems of corruption. And it said that the country has two struggles - one against its internal dysfunctions, its feuds, its corruption, the sort of patronage that is run like any other former Soviet country; and the other struggle is the struggle for independence from Russia, which is the war in the East and the effort to avoid return - a resurgence of Russian influence in Ukraine. DAVIES: Yeah. I just wanted to get your sense of President Zelensky. I don't know if you've spoken with him, but do you see him as someone of substance and conviction? KRAMER: Well, I think that he's from a very difficult business environment - business and entertainment environment. He worked in Russia and also in Ukraine and, you know, in an environment where there really was no safety net, and he did well. So he's a man with a lot of street smarts coming into this job, and he's also somebody who doesn't have any baggage in Ukrainian politics. So it's really turning a new page for Ukraine, and it's about hope that this individual will be different than those who came before. For now, we haven't seen much reason to doubt that. Obviously, the phone call with President Trump in which Zelensky eagerly agreed to pursue a politicized investigation of Joe Biden is cause for concern. DAVIES: You know, he said that there was this prosecutor under the previous president, Lutsenko, who had opened investigations or had made legal moves in the direction of investigating Hunter Biden, Joe Biden's son, as well as the matters of 2016. What has been the posture of President Zelensky on these investigations? I mean, he seemed to be willing to sound cooperative with President Trump on the phone. What's actually happened in terms of initiating investigations, if anything? KRAMER: Well, what's happened is that the new prosecutor has said he will audit these cases, which just leaves a big question mark over them. His audit - does that mean they'll soon be reopened, or does that mean they'll be closed? So Zelensky's really been trying hard to stay on the fence on this issue. DAVIES: He really has to walk a fine line here, doesn't he? KRAMER: Exactly. He may be dealing with a President Biden next year, or he may be dealing with President Trump. DAVIES: This is FRESH AIR, and we're talking about Ukraine, its politics, its history and its connection to the impeachment drama unfolding in Washington. Our guest is Andrew Kramer. He's a reporter for The New York Times based in Moscow, and he has covered events in Ukraine for several years. Let's talk about the war in eastern Ukraine. This grew out of 2014 when Russia annexed Crimea, and then Russian-backed troops are fighting there. Just generally describe the situation in this war. How much progress have the Russians made? What's - how much progress have the government forces made? KRAMER: Certainly. The war had an active phase in 2014 when Russian-backed separatists and Russian activists and agents fomented an uprising in two provinces in eastern Ukraine. We had street demonstrations and then local officials being assassinated or driven out of towns and replaced by pro-Russian figures, all in rapid succession over several months, leading up to an actual military incursion by the Russians in the summer of 2014 - and then a response from the Ukrainian army, which was to deploy artillery and tanks and soldiers into the east in what became, really, a pitched battle in the flatlands of eastern Ukraine, fought over these - this farmland, sunflower fields and in the industrial cities of the country's east for August and part of September of 2014. And then there was a peace settlement - first one in September called the Minsk agreement, followed by a second iteration of that agreement in February and March of 2015 called Minsk II. And after that, the war went into an abeyance. It was settled into a stalemate along a trench front of several hundred miles through the - this rural part of Ukraine. And what's really striking about this war and something that I've really noticed is that the people on both sides of this frontline are the same. They came from the same either industrial cities or rural areas, mostly Russian-speaking, some Ukrainian-speaking. There's no ethnic, linguistic difference between them. This is a war about politics. It's a war about two different political systems that are clashing, and this is the frontline of that clash. It's something like the Berlin Wall where you have a wall dividing Germans with no distinction between them other than politics, and this new dividing line is the trench line in eastern Ukraine. DAVIES: Did you say most of the forces on the government side are also Russian-speaking? KRAMER: Well, many of them are. I don't think most now, but initially, the paramilitary organizations - the pro-Ukrainian paramilitary organizations, including the most significant, which was backed by Ihor Kolomoyskyi, the - now the patron of Zelensky - were Russian-speaking. Russian was the language of radio communication, of commands and of banter in the bunkers and in the trenches, and - just as it was on the other side. DAVIES: But one side wants to ally with Russia. The other side treasures Ukrainian independence. KRAMER: That's right. There was a difference of politics. It was about a view of what sort of governance the country should have. And it really began on Independence Square in the uprising in the capital in 2013 and '14 which became violent, and then it continued in the war. In the struggle between authoritarianism and liberal democracy in Eastern Europe, the Ukrainians became the steel that didn't bend in the protests and also in the war. There's been this very stubborn ability of the Ukrainian paramilitary organizations, activists, the army to hold out for really political causes in this conflict. DAVIES: You visited a unit on the frontlines in Ukraine, right? What did you observe? KRAMER: Well, the war is fought in trench lines, like World War I. And there's a peculiarity of the eastern Ukraine war in that neither side uses aviation because the separatist groups have Russian-supplied anti-aircraft weapons that have cleared the skies of Ukrainian aircraft. And on their side, they have no airplanes, and Russia hasn't provided them. So they fight in almost a early 20th-century manner in trenches. The Ukraine army is very poor. You see this even out at the front. They're making - they're cooking their own food from crates of potatoes and carrots and canned goods. They're fighting with Kalashnikov rifles with binoculars. Obviously, there's heavy equipment involved as well. But on the front, you see an army of - really of poverty and what looks like maybe 1960s-era technology. DAVIES: You're working in an area where there - you know, there are a lot of very savvy players presenting different narratives, and it must be hard to figure things out. I'm wondering if you could talk about how you assess the credibility of the information you get. And also, are you ever concerned about being bugged or followed or harmed? KRAMER: Well, it's obviously a constant struggle to navigate this world of shadows and half-truths that you see in Ukraine, with hackers providing stolen emails, stolen information, with activists coming up with evidence of corruption. And at times when we reported - I remember one incident in 2017. My colleagues and I spent actually weeks puzzling over one document that came to light before deciding that, in fact, it was most likely fake. So it can be a real struggle. And you have to triangulate with multiple interviews and be cautious about information that, in the war in Ukraine and in the broader struggle between Russia and the West, is sometimes a weapon. DAVIES: Well, Andrew Kramer, thank you so much for speaking with us. KRAMER: Thank you. GROSS: Andrew Kramer is a reporter for The New York Times based in Moscow.

            "article_content": "The House is set to vote Tuesday to end President Trump's border wall emergency. It's Election Day in Chicago, voters select a new mayor. And, Walmart is eliminating is greeter positions.  STEVE INSKEEP, HOST: When banks check their finances to see how they would do in a crisis, it's called a stress test. Think of today as a stress test for one part of the Constitution. DAVID GREENE, HOST: That's right. Article I, to be precise, which establishes the powers of Congress. Many lawmakers in both parties say the president improperly seized those powers, spending money Congress denied him to build a border wall. The president claimed this authority by declaring a national emergency, and today House Democrats are expected to pass a resolution that would cancel that emergency. In the Senate, some Republicans also oppose the president. Alaska's Lisa Murkowski spoke to TV station KTUU. LISA MURKOWSKI: I probably will be supporting the resolution to disapprove. Not because I disagree with the president, but because I think it's so important that there be clearer lines when it comes to the separation of powers. INSKEEP: Separation of powers. Getting back to that Constitution. Tamara Keith is NPR's White House correspondent and co-host of the NPR Politics Podcast, and she's with us once again. Hi, Tam. TAMARA KEITH, BYLINE: Good morning. INSKEEP: How's this process work? KEITH: So this process was actually written into the law, the National Emergencies Act, that gave the president the power to declare a national emergency. It also gave Congress the power to roll it back, to terminate it. And so the House is voting today. It's expected to pass because Democrats have a strong majority in the House. Then it goes to the Senate. Now, if you have watched Congress a lot, you know that often the Senate stalls or doesn't take up legislation. Well, they can't do that with this one. This is what's called a privileged resolution. It means it is on a fast track to a vote on the floor of the Senate. INSKEEP: But Republicans who have generally supported the president still have a majority in the Senate. How many Republicans, besides Lisa Murkowski, who we just heard, are willing to defy the president, vote against him here? KEITH: Well, before he declared the emergency, there were a lot of Republicans telling him not to do it, that it would be usurping the congressional power of the purse. Since then they've been a little bit more quiet about it or have said, well, gosh, I really don't like it, but I don't know what I'm going to do. Last night, posted on The Washington Post website, an op-ed from Thom Tillis, who's a Republican senator from North Carolina. He wrote an editorial saying that as a member of the Senate, he has grave concerns when his institution looks the other way at the expense of weakening Congress's powers. He says that he supports the president wanting to build the wall but that he believes, quote, \"it is my responsibility to be a steward of the Article I branch, to preserve the separation of powers and to curb the kind of executive overreach that Congress has allowed to fester for the better part of the past century.\" What we don't know is how many other Republican senators there are like him. INSKEEP: Well, I'm thinking about another Republican senator, Lindsey Graham, who has been notably supportive of the president after being notably critical of him during the presidential campaign. He gave an interview to The New York Times recently in which he said, not for the first time, that he supports President Trump 'cause he wants to be relevant, wants to get things that he thinks are important for the country. Also acknowledged that he wants to get re-elected, and there are a lot of Trump supporters out there. How reluctant are Republicans to cross the president, even at this moment when he's very unpopular? KEITH: Well, it depends on what state they're in and how red and Republican it is. But just before we go, very important to note that the president has said he will veto it if it gets to his desk. And it's not clear that there are really enough people of either party to add up to a veto-proof majority. INSKEEP: You would need a lot of Republicans to make a veto-proof majority. KEITH: A whole lot. INSKEEP: Thanks so much. KEITH: You're welcome. INSKEEP: That's NPR White House correspondent Tamara Keith. She speaks to us, by the way, on this day when the president himself is out of the country visiting Vietnam this week for a summit with North Korea's leader. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) INSKEEP: Voters in Chicago go to the polls today to select their mayor, and they have a lot of choices. GREENE: Like, a lot of choices. We're talking about 14 candidates, a record 14 candidates running to succeed former White House Chief of Staff Rahm Emanuel, who is stepping down after two terms as Chicago's mayor. Among them is Bill Daley, another former White House chief of staff under Obama. His father was also mayor, as was his brother. But polls show that this race is still wide open in a city that is facing some significant challenges. INSKEEP: NPR's David Schaper is in Chicago and trying to keep track of the candidates. Hi there, David. DAVID SCHAPER, BYLINE: Good morning. INSKEEP: So wow - you have almost as many mayoral candidates as there are potential presidential candidates in 2020. So how are you handling this? SCHAPER: Yeah. And enough flavors of ice cream, too. Yeah. You know, one reason for this wide-open race this year is that there's no incumbent. This is only the fourth time in the last century that a sitting mayor wasn't on the ballot. Last time was 2011, when Rich Daley chose not to run for re-election. But had Rahm Emanuel actually chosen to run again, there were several candidates already lining up against him feeling he was vulnerable, particularly because of the fallout of the Laquan McDonald case. You remember, Laquan was the 17-year-old who was shot and killed by a police officer. The trials of the police officer just happened last fall. Many people are unhappy with it, even though he was convicted with a sentence. So when Rahm got out of the race, even more candidates jumped in, including Bill Daley, as you mentioned, and a couple of other local political heavyweights - Toni Preckwinkle, who's president of the Cook County Board and chair of the county Democratic Party, Suzanna Mendoza, who's the state comptroller and has some labor support behind her, as does Preckwinkle. Lori Lightfoot, a former federal prosecutor, who's been pushing hard for police reform. There's a former police superintendent, a millionaire business owner. The list goes on and on - even a young progressive who was endorsed by Chance the Rapper and Kanye West. INSKEEP: Sounds like police conduct is quite central to this campaign. SCHAPER: It's a really big issue, and it's a really big issue particularly among younger voters, who have kind of rallied and mobilized and tried to recruit people to register to vote. They turned out in very strong numbers in the November midterm elections, and the turnout for this election is a little questionable. Steve Valles is with Chicago Votes, which is a nonpartisan group that works to engage young adults in politics. STEVIE VALLES: If young people turn out and vote, we could elect the most progressive mayor in Chicago's history. INSKEEP: Although, of course, Chicagoans could also elect another Daley. We're curious, David, when a Daley is running, do they just use the same Daley signs, campaign signs, around town they've been using since the 1950s? SCHAPER: No. No. See, they have a lot of money behind by these candidacies so they're able to print up new signs every election. So none of them are faded. And there is kind of a trend here. Even Bill Daley is trying to almost out-progressive some of the other candidates in this race, trying to make him seem not as much like his father and his brother, who many people feel left the city with a legacy of inequality across the city and even racism, as many cities in the North do. But, you know, all of the candidates are kind of trying to out-progressive one another. Be - you know, shoulder progressive credentials. And it's part of this trend that the Democratic Party is experiencing all across the country, as we saw in the November midterms. This could just echo those very similar themes across the country. INSKEEP: David, thanks for your insights. Really appreciate it. SCHAPER: My pleasure, Steve. INSKEEP: NPR's David Schaper is in Chicago, which holds a mayoral election today. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) INSKEEP: Walmart, which is the largest private employer in the United States, is making a big change. GREENE: Yeah. It's a change that people who know Walmart and shop there will really, I mean, notice. The retailer confirmed to NPR that it is now eliminating its trademark front-door job of people greeters in stores across the country and replacing them with this new position they're calling customer hosts. And this change in job requirements for the new position appears to be disproportionately affecting workers with disabilities. INSKEEP: And with us in our studios is NPR business correspondent Alina Selyukh. Hi there. Good morning. ALINA SELYUKH, BYLINE: Hello. INSKEEP: And you've been talking with some people with disabilities who've been Walmart greeters. SELYUKH: I have spent the past week hearing from greeters who are essentially expecting to lose their jobs on April 25 or 26. All of them are people with disabilities. And they're worried because the new job of this host has requirements that can be pretty impossible if you're in a wheelchair. I read the job description, and it says you must be able to, for example, lift 25 pounds or stand for long periods of time. And then to qualify for other jobs at the store, workers say they've been told that they must be able to climb a ladder - same issue. And this... INSKEEP: The whole idea is to help people move around a crowded store and get stuff down. SELYUKH: And do a variety of things, including help shoppers load things into their carts. It varies by store. And this change is happening in about a thousand stores. And I've spoken to workers from five states, and one of them was Mitchell (ph) from Alabama, who's been a greeter for four years. MITCHELL: It gives me a place to go every day where I'm not sitting home. I'm able to work. I want to work. I want to be out in society. SELYUKH: We're not sharing Mitchell's last name because he's worried about retribution. INSKEEP: Absolutely. What is Walmart saying when you go to them with these concerns you've heard? SELYUKH: Yeah. Walmart has acknowledged the unique situation of workers with disabilities. And so the company actually told me it's now deciding to give greeters more time beyond April 25 to figure out their job situation. And, you know, Walmart is huge. It is one of the largest employers of people with disabilities. And the Americans with Disabilities Act does not preclude companies from changing job descriptions as they need. What the law does require is for companies to provide, quote, \"reasonable accommodations,\" as long as the worker can do the essential functions of the job. INSKEEP: I have to say, though, this is one of the defining features of Walmart, is the Walmart greeter. It's got to be one of the few jobs in retail where everybody in America knows the name, the name of the job, Walmart greeter. Is this a huge change for Walmart? SELYUKH: It is. But it is currently just the latest wave of this. Walmart has been making this change in about a thousand stores already. It's been happening since 2016. And to be honest, the frustrating part is that none of the workers I've talked to have actually seen any kind of document explaining this policy and its rollout. I spoke to the family of two workers who were affected by this last year. They're actually cousins, Joe and John Wirth, both of whom use wheelchairs, and say they both lost their jobs as greeters in April. Here's John. JOHN WIRTH: They were like, good luck with whatever you decide to do. And just a handshake. And that made me feel like, oh, OK. SELYUKH: Well, he's clearly not OK. He's pretty distraught. It's messing up his income, his independence. He says back in April, he took two buses to work, like he usually does, only to discover his badge didn't work. The Wirth cousins have a claim against Walmart with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission in Michigan. I know of two other claims in Texas and Wisconsin, and a lawsuit in Utah. Walmart has not commented on those to NPR. INSKEEP: Alina, thanks for digging into this. Really appreciate it. SELYUKH: Thank you. INSKEEP: That's NPR's Alina Selyukh. Copyright \u00a9 2019 NPR.

There is widespread skepticism on the border that President Trump will get anywhere near the 450 miles of wall he wants by next November. Acting Homeland Security Secretary Chad Wolf visited a construction site in the Rio Grande Valley of Texas on a windswept day last month and repeated a Trump administration pledge. \"We are on track to build 450 to 500 miles of new wall by the end of 2020,\" he told reporters. Behind him, steel panels atop a concrete levee wall, 30 feet in all,  are rising from the sugar cane fields and bird sanctuaries of the valley \u2014 which is really a river delta. They are the first section of new border wall built under President Trump where there was no barrier before. But that swaggering Washington confidence is not shared down on the border. Asked about Trump's Election Day deadline, Carmen Qualia, an assistant chief with the Border Patrol, acknowledged it's slow going. \"[Trump] said, 'Hey, here's my deadline, here's what I need you to do.' So we're gonna continue to work towards meeting that deadline,\" said Qualia, who is in charge of the Rio Grande Valley wall team. \"And we're either going to make it or not.\" Trump gets an additional $1.4 billion toward his massive wall along the 2,000-mile southwest border under a government spending bill he is expected to sign. But in Texas, there's widespread skepticism the president will have anywhere near the 450 miles of wall he wants by next December. Construction has already fallen behind schedule because of how difficult it is to take private land. Acting Homeland Security Secretary Chad Wolf speaks after touring the U.S.-Mexico border in El Paso, Texas, on Nov. 20.\n                \n                    \n                    Cedar Attanasio/AP\n                    \n                \nhide caption Acting Homeland Security Secretary Chad Wolf speaks after touring the U.S.-Mexico border in El Paso, Texas, on Nov. 20. One contract reviewed by NPR, called RGV10, says construction isn't expected to begin on certain wall segments until March 2021 \u2014 well after the election. \"If you don't have 12 months to acquire property, you're cutting it way too short,\" said Hyla Head, a former real estate specialist with the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers who spearheaded land acquisition for the first phase of wall-building under President George W. Bush in 2008. Customs and Border Protection, which is part of Homeland Security, doesn't yet own most of the land where it plans to build the wall. In fact, Wolf's photo op was staged on a half-mile section of the levee that was only recently acquired by the federal government. Hidalgo County land records show that much of the property needed to complete that stretch of wall is still in private hands. Disorderly property records, complications with landowners and a cumbersome condemnation process have slowed progress to a snail's pace. That's despite an army of federal land specialists trying to rush the process to please the president. Consider this: The government plans to erect 110 miles of the total 450 miles of barriers in the Rio Grande Valley. But as of last week, the feds still needed to acquire about 90 miles from private landowners. In fact, since January 2017 the administration has only taken three miles from private owners in the Rio Grande Valley, according to a CBP spokesperson. \"It's a big project,\" Qualia said. \"We're gonna continue to do what we can to make it happen.\" But she says agents want the tall wall, along with floodlights, sensors, cameras and a 150-foot-wide enforcement zone to combat drug and human trafficking. \"We've been asking for these tools, this technology ... the roads,\" Qualia said. \"And if it takes longer, it takes longer.\" Most of the borderlands in Texas are privately owned, unlike states to the west where a strip along the border is mostly federal property. A section of the new 18-foot border wall is built in Donna, Texas. The new wall construction is already falling behind schedule because of the difficulty of acquiring private land.\n                \n                    \n                    Ver\u00f3nica G. C\u00e1rdenas for NPR\n                    \n                \nhide caption A section of the new 18-foot border wall is built in Donna, Texas. The new wall construction is already falling behind schedule because of the difficulty of acquiring private land. \"Every project that has real estate acquisition is prevented from making faster progress,\" said a senior manager with detailed knowledge of wall building in the Rio Grande Valley who is not authorized to speak publicly. Under eminent domain, the government can take private property for public use, but it has to pay for it. And that process is laborious and legalistic. \"Federal entities that acquire property have a process,\" said Head. \"You may not like it, but this is tried and true. We have laws to protect property owners.\" Roy Brandys, an eminent domain lawyer in Austin, Texas, has long experience representing border clients. Asked about completing the border wall in the valley by next December, he said, \"That would be a very aggressive schedule, very difficult to get accomplished just because of all the different issues that properties have.\" Each step of the process is proving problematic. First, the government has to identify and make contact with each property owner. In Starr County, at the western end of the Rio Grande Valley, the government is planning 52 miles of border wall. Ultimately, the administration will need to acquire acreage on hundreds of individual parcels. So far, the wall contractor has broken ground only in one unit owned by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. \"It's very difficult to know who the rightful owners are. That's the biggest challenge,\" said Rosalva Guerra, the chief appraiser of Starr County, where property records are notoriously incomplete. The computer screen of Starr County Chief Appraiser Rosalva Guerra is awash with red. These are properties where the county is unsure of the owner. \n\n                    \n                    John Burnett/NPR\n                    \n                \nhide caption The computer screen of Starr County Chief Appraiser Rosalva Guerra is awash with red. These are properties where the county is unsure of the owner. In her tidy office, she pulls up a map on her computer screen that shows all the properties in the county. The map is awash with red, the color used to denote parcels where the county is unsure of the owner. In Starr County, property has been handed down through many generations, some of it going back to land grants made by the King of Spain. Tracts are divided and subdivided between heirs, but Guerra says they rarely establish clear title. \"So can you imagine the long list of heirs to partition that?\" Guerra said. \"It's a nightmare. Yeah, it's just going to take a long time to be able to do that. I don't think it's going to happen by 2020.\" Yet a senior CBP official in Washington was not so pessimistic about the construction timetable. \"If [landowners] don't voluntarily sell and we have to condemn the property,\" the official said, \"the judge can grant possession to the government nearly immediately after the declaration of taking and we can begin construction. ... We're getting a lot of offers to sell down there.\" A Border Patrol vehicle is parked near the existing border wall south of Donna, Texas.\n                \n                    \n                    Ver\u00f3nica G.

Identifying the owner is only the first step. Then the government must request access to survey the land. So far, the Justice Department has had to sue nearly 50 property owners in the Rio Grande Valley just to get that access. One of those defendants is Delfino Garza, an architect in Starr County. He didn't want government surveyors coming on his property outside Rio Grande City where he has a vineyard. As a sideline, he planted grapes a decade ago, clearing thick brush down by the Rio Grande for his vine rows. \"After about the third year, we started to make wine. And now in the last year they came to us about putting a border wall on our property,\" Garza said. Garza is fighting the border wall. He voted for Trump, but he says he won't do so a second time. He fears the wall will kill his infant winemaking business. \"People don't go to wineries to see a border wall,\" he said. \"We want this to be an attraction for the city. And this is just hurting us.\" Qualia, the Border Patrol official in charge of the Rio Grande Valley wall team, says the government is trying not to be heavy-handed. Land acquistion specialists are spending time talking to landowners like Garza about the placement of the barrier on his  vineyard property. \"I think it's important to note that we all live here, too,\" Qualia said. \"Our kids go to school. We go to church. So we really take that into consideration when we're sitting down and meeting with these owners.\" And, inevitably, those discussions with landowners will delay the project further. \"Things that are complicated typically do take time,\" Qualia added. Meanwhile, Trump has appointed his son-in-law and senior adviser Jared Kushner to oversee and speed up completion of the border wall. The president has asked for frequent updates. He reportedly told aides earlier this year, just \"take the land.\" But in the Rio Grande Valley of Texas, it's not that easy. Senior Producer Marisa Pe\u00f1aloza contributed to this story.",

Republican lawmakers are also touting wins. Updated at on Dec. 17 at 2:30 p.m. ET Congressional leaders unveiled two massive spending measures and touted key wins in the $1.3 trillion spending agreement to fund the government for the remainder of the 2020 fiscal year just days before a critical government shutdown deadline. The House passed the spending bills with bipartisan support on Tuesday. The Senate is expected to approve both bills later this week and send them to the president for his signature. The measure boosts funding for key Democratic and Republican initiatives, such as election security, 2020 census efforts, border security funding, research to address gun violence and 3.1% pay raises for servicemembers and federal workers. It also includes a new measure to raise the age of tobacco use to 21 and repeal the so-called \"Cadillac taxes,\" or health taxes on employer plans that have drawn bipartisan opposition, congressional aides said. Read the text of the packages here and here. \"These bills are the product of bipartisan bicameral compromise,\" House Appropriations Committee Chairwoman Nita Lowey, D-N.Y., said before the House Rules panel Monday evening. \"While there are some things I would have done differently had I written these bills alone, I am very proud of the work we have completed together. These bills raise funding for critical, national priorities.\" The plan would permanently fund the government through Sept. 30, 2020 after months of operating off temporary budget measures known as continuing resolutions to keep the lights on. Lawmakers have struggled to get far on negotiations in recent months as a result of fights over border security funding and the House impeachment inquiry. Democrats\u2019 impeachment obsession has pushed key legislation to the 11th hour. Government funding has been jeopardized by the House\u2019s procrastination. Democratic leadership must not stand in the way of bipartisan solutions that families across America deserve. The current continuing resolution will expire Friday evening \u2014 Federal agencies run out of money at midnight on Friday unless Congress passes the deal and the president signs it. Lawmakers had weighed the potential of approving another CR if they couldn't reach an agreement for the larger spending measures. White House Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin has met with Lowey, Senate Appropriations Committee Chairman Richard Shelby, R-Ala. and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi as part of the spending talks in recent weeks. On Thursday afternoon, Lowey and others emerged from Pelosi's office to claim victory in a new agreement to avert a government shutdown. On Monday, Pelosi touted wins in the agreement. \"All Democrats can take great pride in this strong appropriations package, which achieves critical victories for the health, financial security and well-being of the American people,\" Pelosi said in a statement Monday evening. \"With this agreement, Democrats are protecting the quality, affordable health care of millions by permanently repealing health care taxes and preventing the President from waging further health care sabotage.\" Pelosi, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and others also touted a new age requirement of 21 for tobacco use. McConnell, a Republican who hails from the tobacco state of Kentucky, joined forces with Sens. Tim Kaine, D-Va., Todd Young, R-Ind., and Mitt Romney, R-Utah in a bipartisan push earlier this year for the new age requirement. \"Stories of vaping related illnesses and deaths \u2014 especially among young people \u2014 have stunned Kentucky and the nation,\" McConnell said in a statement Monday evening. \"I'm grateful to the communities, the health advocates and my fellow elected officials, including President Trump and Senators Todd Young and Mitt Romney, who have joined Senator Kaine and me to address this urgent crisis and keep these dangerous products away from our children.\" The package also includes funding for all 12 regular spending bills under a $1.3 trillion topline figure reached with a bipartisan budget agreement in July. In addition to the provisions boasted by Democrats and the GOP like border security funding and gun violence research, Sen. Joe Manchin, D-W.V., touted a provision in the agreement to secure pensions and health care for nearly 100,000 coal miners and their families. \"I want to thank my colleagues in Congress, Democrats and Republicans, for making this a truly bipartisan effort,\" Manchin said in a statement. \"I look forward to voting for this crucial bill later this week and sending it to the President so he can sign it into law and provide some well-deserved peace of mind to these great Americans that have done everything this country has asked of them.\" A Democratic aide said the measure includes $7.6 billion for the 2020 census count ($1.4 billion more than proposed by the Trump administration), $425 million for election security grants and $25 million for gun violence research through the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the National Institutes of Health \u2014 the first such funding in more than 20 years. A Republican aide said the measure includes a $22 billion boost over 2019 fiscal year spending levels for the military, a 3.1% pay raise for servicemembers and $1.375 billion for border security funding. The president had previously demanded $8.6 billion for the border wall.

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu will be his party's leader when Israel holds a national election in March, after notching a landslide victory in the Likud Party primary Thursday. Netanyahu had faced a rare challenger in Likud's primary race, but he secured more than 70% of the vote. \"A huge win!\" Netanyahu said via Twitter. He also promised to take Likud and Israel to great new achievements. Some of them hinge on new concessions from the U.S., where the Trump administration has broken with decades of precedents by recognizing Jerusalem as the capital of Israel and moving the U.S. Embassy to the city. In a victory speech after Thursday's vote, Netanyahu promised more gains to his conservative base. \"We will set our final borders, bring about American recognition for Israeli control over Jordan Valley, the Dead Sea and our sovereignty over every settlement in Judea and Samaria,\" Netanyahu said, according to The Jerusalem Post. He added that his government will \"obtain a defense pact with U.S. that will ensure Israeli freedom to act, we will defeat Iran and achieve a peace pact with Arab countries.\" Netanyahu, Israel's longest-serving prime minister, will run for reelection despite problems that range from his own legal troubles to his party's failure to secure a majority in parliament in September's election. The prime minister faces several criminal charges, helping to fuel recent gains by the rival Blue and White Party and its centrist leader, Benny Gantz. And those issues don't seem likely to fade away: Netanyahu was indicted on bribery and other charges last month. Gantz issued a statement Friday calling for Israel to \"set out on a new, clean path under Blue and White's leadership.\" The alternative, he said, is to \"stay stuck in a place with a sitting prime minister facing three charges of corruption, fraud and breach of trust, who is placing his own personal interest above the best interests of Israel's citizens.\" Neither Netanyahu nor Gantz was able to broker a ruling coalition after a very close vote in autumn. And with Israel in political gridlock, the country will hold its third election in the span of a year. While those concerns didn't change the opinion of Likud voters who see Netanyahu as their best chance to regain control, there are also warning signs for the prime minister in Thursday's results. \"Netanyahu had a resounding victory with 72.5% of the votes,\" NPR's Daniel Estrin reports from Jerusalem. \"But voter turnout in his party primaries was only about 50% \u2014 and more than a quarter of the voters didn't choose Netanyahu. That could mean Netanyahu will have a hard time getting enough right-wing voters to come to the polls to help him win national elections in March.\"",

A lot of Pelosi's decisions have come to define 2019. An overarching and important theme of 2019 was the shifting power dynamic in Washington. The 2018 midterm elections put Democrats in control of the House of Representatives after eight years of Republican control \u2014 and made Nancy Pelosi House speaker for the second time in her career. That had consequences, including the use of the ultimate check on presidential authority, impeachment. Many of this year's most-read political stories on NPR.org centered on what the newly minted majority Democrats would do and how they'd use their power. Other major stories of the year include the release of Robert Mueller's report on Russian interference in the 2016 election and the Democratic presidential primary race kicking into high gear. Stories that just missed the top 10 covered Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg's health, the early 2019 government shutdown, whether President Trump's tax returns would have to be released, several on the Ukraine affair that led to Trump's impeachment and Trump's Hurricane Dorian Sharpie moment. Here are the headlines that did make the cut: After Hillary Clinton lost in 2016 despite winning the popular vote by some 3 million votes, additional states have pushed for legislation to essentially eliminate the Electoral College. That isn't likely to happen anytime soon because of states controlled by Republicans, but it's proof of just how much Democrats are smarting since 2000. In two of the three presidential elections that Democrats lost this century, they won the popular vote. Americans appear conflicted. A Pew Research Center poll last year found that 55% want the Constitution amended so the candidate who receives the most votes wins. But a July NPR/PBS NewsHour/Marist poll found just 42% of Americans thought eliminating the Electoral College was a good idea. Twitter is not normally a place where people with polarized views find consensus. But it was the platform where it started for two of the most outspoken politicians of this era \u2014 liberal Democratic Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York and conservative Republican Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas. You\u2019re on. https://t.co/S3TBfNeO3Q The duo teamed up on legislation that would impose a lifetime ban on members of Congress becoming lobbyists. Not everyone thinks that's such a great idea, because there could be unintended consequences. No ban has passed since this story got attention. In June, Rep. David Cicilline of Rhode Island introduced a bill prohibiting members of Congress from lobbying. But it only had one cosponsor and it went nowhere. As of August, Ocasio-Cortez said her legislative team was in discussion with Cruz's. Cruz and Ocasio-Cortez looked like they might team up again on making birth control available over the counter, but Ocasio-Cortez balked, saying she wants something done about affordability of birth control, too. Trump used his first Oval Office address to try and make the sale on his desired border wall along the U.S.-Mexico border. NPR fact-checked six of the claims the president made, including that his rhetoric overstates the criminal threat of immigrants and that most of the illegal drugs entering the country go through legal ports of entry that a border wall would not stop. Trump also said the wall would be paid for \"indirectly\" by the U.S.-Mexico-Canada trade agreement. That's a far cry from his original campaign claim that Mexico would pay for a wall \u2014 the country isn't.

During the record-long partial government shutdown in January, Trump's approval rating fell to 39% in the NPR/PBS NewsHour/Marist poll. That time saw him with his lowest average score for the year. His approval rating has since recovered slightly, up to about 45% in the average of the polls and 42% in the most recent NPR poll. Trump's approval rating has never been above 45% in the NPR poll or below 35% (in August 2017 after his response to the racist violence in Charlottesville, Va.). In the past year, it's been a range of 39% to 44%. Trump's ratings are historically low on average and seemingly immovable, signaling a potentially brutal 2020 presidential election to come. With Democrats' takeover of the House in early 2019, it meant not just the dawning of a check on Trump but also a new way of doing business after eight years of GOP control. A lot of what Democrats implemented was in response to the tense intra- and inter-party fighting of the Boehner years. When Republican John Boehner was speaker, he faced a debt-ceiling crisis because conservative hard-liners looked to force spending cuts. Pelosi moved to make debt-ceiling raises automatic. She also created a committee to address climate change, revived a rule to give lawmakers 72 hours to read major legislation before they can vote and amended rules on discrimination to allow religious headwear to be worn in the House chamber. And looking to avoid the coup attempts faced by Boehner, she made it tougher to oust a sitting speaker. Pelosi's tight grip on her caucus would show again in the push to impeach Trump. Just two Democrats \u2014 one of whom switched to become a Republican \u2014 defied Pelosi and voted against the most significant article of impeachment against Trump, abuse of power. Loading... The issue of illegal immigration has been dominated by talk of migrants coming across the nation's southernmost border because of Trump's campaign for a border wall. But the reality is that most people in the United States illegally didn't cross the border; they came legally and didn't leave. The Mueller report on Russian interference in the 2016 election was arguably the most anticipated document of 2019. That 400-page report noted that while the Justice Department's guidance is not to indict a sitting president, the findings did not \"exonerate\" Trump. \"The evidence we obtained about the President's actions and intent presents difficult issues that prevent us from conclusively determining that no criminal conduct occurred,\" the report noted. \"Accordingly, while this report does not conclude that the President committed a crime, it also does not exonerate him.\" Former FBI Director Robert Mueller is sworn in before he testifies before the House Judiciary Committee on his report on Russian election interference in July.\n                \n                    \n                    Andrew Harnik/AP\n                    \n                \nhide caption Former FBI Director Robert Mueller is sworn in before he testifies before the House Judiciary Committee on his report on Russian election interference in July. In fact, it found multiple contacts between Trump campaign officials and Russians, that Russia was trying to get Trump elected, and that Trump campaign officials welcomed it. The report also found several potential instances of obstruction of justice committed by the president. \"[T]he Constitution requires a process other than the criminal justice system to formally accuse a sitting president of wrongdoing,\" Mueller said in a news conference, a month after his report was released. But that process \u2014 impeachment \u2014 would not come, as it related to the Mueller report, especially after the special counsel's shaky public testimony in July. After the Ukraine affair, Democrats did consider an obstruction of justice charge, as it relates to the Mueller report, to show a broader pattern from the president, but they ultimately opted against it. This was Trump's first State of the Union address after the Democrats' takeover of the House. But rather than graciously acknowledge the new power dynamic in Washington, like past presidents have, Trump jumped right in. He touted an \"unprecedented economic boom\" (it's not), wages that are \"rising at the fastest pace in decades\" (they aren't) and took credit for unleashing \"a revolution in American energy,\" making the U.S. \"now the No. 1 producer of oil and natural gas anywhere in the world\" (even though the record fracking expansion predates his time in office). Trump also warned, \"If there is going to be peace and legislation, there cannot be war and investigation.\" Obviously, that threat did not stop Democrats from impeaching him. Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez was one of the breakout figures of the 2018 election.\n                \n                    \n                    Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez was one of the breakout figures of the 2018 election. Ocasio-Cortez was one of the breakout figures of the 2018 election. She ran as an unabashed and uncompromising progressive who stood for the opposite of Trump. And her bold Green New Deal, introduced with Massachusetts Sen. Ed Markey, grabbed headlines and attention. The Green New Deal \u2014 as described by NPR's Danielle Kurtzleben \u2014 is \"a massive policy package that would remake the U.S. economy and, [Ocasio-Cortez and Markey] hope, eliminate all U.S. carbon emissions. That's a really big \u2014 potentially impossibly big \u2014 undertaking.\" Support for the proposal became something of a litmus test for progressives, but its boldness also made it a lightning rod that conservatives have used to target Democrats. For Democrats, though, especially younger ones, climate change is an increasingly important issue. In the latest NPR/PBS NewsHour/Marist poll, climate change is the No. 2 issue for Democrats and tops the list for progressives and Democratic men. (Democratic women picked health care first, with climate not too far behind.) This story highlighted the newfound power of House Democrats. As a sign of the close relationship between Republican former Speaker Paul Ryan and Vice President Pence, a former congressman from Indiana, Ryan set aside office space for Pence on the House side. But soon after Pelosi was sworn in, she reversed that. Vice presidents generally maintain an office on Capitol Hill on the Senate side, given their role technically as president of the Senate. If there's a tie in the Senate, the vice president breaks it. Pence, in fact, has so far been called on to break ties 13 times during the Trump administration, including on the nomination of Education Secretary Betsy DeVos, to begin debate on repealing the health care law and on a bill to give states permission to withhold federal family planning funds from Planned Parenthood. Life in the minority in the House is tough. The majority rules \u2014 and makes them, and this showed that in a very tangible way.",

Trump for President, Inc.\n                    \n                \nhide caption On Christmas Eve, the Trump campaign launched a website intended to give the president's supporters talking points to counter \"that liberal snowflake relative.\" The Trump campaign on Christmas Eve launched a website full of talking points intended to help supporters of the president win arguments with \"that liberal snowflake relative.\" Featuring videos on topics from the economy to immigration and attacks on the media, snowflakevictory.com seeks to provide pro-Trump tidbits that can be brought to the holiday dinner table. \"Family holidays. Full of love. Full of laughter. And full of the inevitable conversations with the family liberal who just does not want to believe how great America is doing with President Trump in office,\" according to the website. Set to patriotic-sounding music, a female narrator offers some thoughts on the impeachment of the president \u2014 a relevant subject, as the Senate readies for a trial over the president's alleged abuse of power and obstruction of Congress. \"President Trump asked for nothing in exchange for lethal military aid to Ukraine,\" the narrator says, echoing Republican talking points about the now-infamous July 25 phone call with Ukraine President Volodymr Zelenskiy. \"It is thanks to President Trump, that the Ukrainians are getting the aid in the first place,\" she says. House Democrats say the president sought to enlist Ukraine to interfere in the 2020 election by conditioning congressionally approved security assistance to the country on Kyiv's willingness to announce an investigation into Trump's chief political rival, Joe Biden, and his son, Hunter. But the Trump campaign is telling supporters to flip the assertion on its head, saying Democrats are the ones who should be accused of election interference. \"Democrats have never accepted the results of the last election, so they're trying to interfere with the next one,\" the site says. The website also credits Trump for the strong economy, telling supporters not to forget to mention this when speaking to friends and loved ones. Missing from this talking point is the fact that the economic expansion started well before Trump took office. The website also hammers on immigration and healthcare. Although Trump's restrictive immigration policies and incendiary remarks about immigrants have prompted widespread criticism from rights advocates, the new campaign site highlights something Trump tends to avoid on the campaign trail: his own connection to immigration. \"Like most of us, President Trump's ancestors were immigrants, and he's married to our amazing first lady, who is herself as immigrant,\" the site points out. The video then pivots to the president's plan to stop illegal immigration, saying a southwestern border wall with Mexico is the preferred way to achieve this goal. Opponents of Trump's hard-line immigration policies, the website argues, are driven by feelings. \"Don't let crazy family members and friends get away with throwing out liberal talking points and faux 'feelings.' The facts are the facts,\" the site says. Another major topic on the videos seems to take aim at the proposals of some of the Democratic presidential contenders who are pushing \"Medicare for all\" plans. The campaign's rebuttal?: \"The 2020 Democrats are the ones who want to strip you of your private, employer-provided health insurance!\" Not all of the Democratic presidential candidates currently support a government-controlled single-payer health insurance system. Among those who do, the exact definition of \"Medicare for all\" varies, with some proposals looking to keep private insurance in place.",

Above, they appear during the Democratic presidential primary debate in Atlanta on Nov. 20.\n                \n                    \n                    Alex Wong/Getty Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption Former Vice President Joe Biden and Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders lead the crowded Democratic field, pulling in together about half of the support of Democratic voters and Democratic-leaning independents, according to the latest NPR/PBS NewsHour/Marist Poll. Biden leads with 24%, followed closely by Sanders at 22%. Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren is third with 17%, followed by South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg at 13%, all together making up a clear top tier of four candidates. Entrepreneur Andrew Yang is fifth with 5%; former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg, Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar and New Jersey Sen. Cory Booker all pull in 4%. Clustered together with just 1% support are former Secretary of Housing and Urban Development Juli\u00e1n Castro, Hawaii Rep. Tulsi Gabbard and Colorado Sen. Michael Bennet. Former Massachusetts Gov. Deval Patrick, billionaire Tom Steyer, spiritualist and author Marianne Williamson and former Rep. John Delaney all get less than 1%. The poll comes ahead of the next Democratic debate, this Thursday in Los Angeles and sponsored by the PBS NewsHour and Politico. Importantly, while two-thirds of Democratic voters and Democratic-leaning independents say they are satisfied with the Democratic field, three-quarters (76%) say they could change their minds on whom they currently support. So this is potentially a very fluid race, and it is why, despite Biden leading consistently in national polls, there has been so much movement in early-state polls. While Biden continues to lead in national polling, when it comes to all-important state polls, Buttigieg has seen a surge of late. He narrowly leads Sanders in Iowa and narrowly trails him in New Hampshire, with Biden and Warren not far behind, according to RealClearPolitics' average of the polls. \"We're looking for late action, because it's so fluid,\" Lee Miringoff, director of the Marist Institute for Public Opinion, which conducted the poll, said of potential change before the first nominating states cast votes. \"I think we're looking at the last surge\" for who could win. Different coalitions for the Democratic candidates The top candidates draw support from different parts of the Democratic Party, the poll shows. Biden does best with white women without a college degree (34%), older voters over 45 (33%), moderates (31%), those making less than $50,000 a year (30%) and voters in the South (31%), where many of the Democratic primary voters are African American. Notably, though, Sanders is the candidate who narrowly leads with nonwhite voters, 29% to 26%, over Biden. This might be because of Sanders' strength with younger voters of color and Latinos. But the margins of error with these subgroups are too high to draw any definitive conclusions. Sanders also leads with younger voters under 45 (37%), progressives (29%), people who live in big cities (28%), voters in the Northeast (27%) and men (27%). Warren is second with progressives (23%). Buttigieg leads with whites with a college degree (23%), including women. Again, Warren is a close second with these groups. So Warren is competing on two separate fronts for support \u2014 with the progressives who might be inclined to the policies of Sanders and with Buttigieg for college-educated whites. Loading...

By a 54% to 44% margin, Democratic voters think it's more important to have a nominee who has the best chance of beating Trump than someone who shares their position on most issues. And by a 49% to 42% margin, they say it's more important to have a nominee who will move in a different direction from former President Obama's policies. Among those who think it's more important to move past Obama's policies, Sanders leads the field with 28%, followed by Biden at 17%, Warren at 16% and Buttigieg at 9%. But Biden leads handily when it comes to those who say it's more important to continue Obama's policies \u2014 34% to Buttigieg's 19%, Warren's 17% and Sanders' 14%. On the issues Overall, Americans rated the economy (27%) as the most important issue to them, followed by health care (23%), climate change (16%), education (13%), immigration (10%) and gun policy (9%). But, predictably, Democrats and Republicans believe very different things are important. For Democrats, the poll found the top issues are health care (30%), climate change (29%), the economy (13%) and education (12%). For Republicans, it's overwhelmingly the economy (41%), followed much further back by immigration (17%), health care (16%) and gun policy (10%). Democrats have put forward a host of policy positions. Some \u2014 like \"Medicare for All\" as a replacement for private health insurance, decriminalizing illegal border crossings and a universal basic income of $1,000 a month \u2014 provide warnings for the party, as none is able to win support from a majority of the overall electorate. But Democrats are on solid ground when talking about stricter background checks for gun purchases, stricter regulation of prescription drug prices, a pathway to citizenship for immigrants in the U.S. illegally, a Green New Deal that addresses climate change by investing in green jobs and energy-efficient infrastructure, and legalizing marijuana. All are supported by 60% or more of Americans. There is also majority support for forgiving student loan debt for lower-income people, a wealth tax on wealth above $1 million, keeping but making changes to Obamacare, a public option for health care, a ban on semiautomatic assault-style weapons, a national minimum wage of $15 an hour, taxing carbon emissions and offering free tuition at public colleges and universities. But Republicans give majority support only for gun background checks and stricter prescription drug regulations. Loading... Don't see the graphic above? Click here.

Updated at 6:51 p.m. ET Democrats in the House took the next step toward impeachment on Monday with the presentation of what they call the evidence of President Trump's improper conduct in the Ukraine affair. \"President Trump's persistent and continuing effort to coerce a foreign country to help him cheat to win an election is a clear and present danger to our free and fair elections and to our national security,\" said Daniel Goldman, the Democratic staff counsel who presented the Democrats' case in the Judiciary Committee hearing. Goldman, a former federal prosecutor for the Southern District of New York, presented evidence congressional investigators had gathered about what he called Trump's \"months-long scheme to solicit foreign help in his 2020 reelection campaign, withholding official acts from the government of Ukraine in order to coerce and secure political interference in our domestic affairs.\" Democrats said they believe the case for taking action is obvious. \"The evidence shows that Donald J. Trump, the president of the United States, has put himself before his country,\" House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerry Nadler of New York said in his opening statement. \"He has violated his most basic responsibilities to the people. He has broken his oath.\" Republican ranking member Doug Collins of Georgia argued that Democrats are pursuing impeachment because of a \"personal vendetta.\" \"They can't get over the fact that Donald J. Trump is president of the United States,\" Collins said, \"and they don't think they have a candidate who can beat [him]. It's all a show.\" House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., confirmed last week that she and her lieutenants have decided to draft articles of impeachment against President Trump. So now, the Judiciary Committee says it must first receive the Intelligence Committee's report formally and then assess what charges to prefer. \"Read the Transcripts!\" During the hearing, President Trump asked his Twitter followers to read the account of the phone call he had on July 25 with his Ukrainian counterpart. \"Read the Transcripts!\" he wrote. Read the Transcripts! But interpretation of a July 25 call between Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy is the key to whether what the president did was improper and impeachable. During that call, according to a call summary released by the White House, Trump asked for a \"favor, though\" after Zelenskiy mentioned key weapons that Ukraine needs and has been using in its fight against Russia at its eastern border. Trump proceeded to ask for help investigating two conspiracy theories \u2014 one about Ukraine's involvement in the 2016 election (for which there is no evidence) and a conspiracy theory about former Vice President Joe Biden's son Hunter's role on the board of a Ukrainian energy company, Burisma. Several witnesses, which included senior diplomats and national security officials, testified over the past few weeks that they thought the call was inappropriate, that the request was political and intended to help the president's reelection and not about corruption writ large in Ukraine. What's more, the American public says that what the president did was wrong \u2014 70% in the most recent NPR/PBS NewsHour/Marist poll said it is not acceptable for a president to ask a foreign leader to investigate a political opponent. The Trump administration was withholding a White House meeting and almost $400 million in military aid, while a pressure campaign was taking place, led by the president's personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani. European Union Ambassador Gordon Sondland, who had multiple contacts with Giuliani, the president and Ukrainian officials, testified that there was a \"quid pro quo.\" He said a White House meeting was being held up until Ukraine announced the investigations Giuliani and President Trump sought. That meeting has never happened. The aid was eventually released Sept. 11 without explanation. Republican counsel Stephen Castor, who asked many of the questions during the Intelligence Committee hearings, questioned the strength of Sondland's testimony. He said Sondland had \"no firsthand knowledge\" of a direct \"quid pro quo\" linkage to President Trump. \"He merely presumed there were preconditions,\" Castor said. Castor said Democrats are centering their evidence of wrongdoing on the call summary the White House released with Ukraine's president. But, he contended, \"it is not\" evidence of of impeachable conduct. He also called Democrats' reasoning \"baloney.\" Castor was also critical of Democrats' timeline for impeachment, calling it an \"artificial and arbitrary\" deadline. On the process, which began in September, he accused Democrats of \"fundamentally unfair\" tactics, calling the impeachment inquiry a \"rushed, take-it-or-leave-it approach.\" One of the potential articles of impeachment Democrats could bring against the president is obstruction of Congress. That centers on the number of witnesses and documents that have not been released from the Trump administration despite subpoenas for those witnesses and documents. Castor later contended that Trump was \"not asking for a personal favor\" on the phone call with Zelenskiy. \"He was speaking on behalf of the American people,\" Castor said. Republican complaints about phone records Beyond the contents of that Trump-Zelenskiy call, Republicans voiced frustration with congressional investigators gathering phone records of key players involved in the pressure campaign. Those records included, perhaps surprisingly, Devin Nunes, the ranking member of the House Intelligence Committee. Nunes was integral in the questioning of witnesses during the public and private impeachment proceedings and depositions. He strongly made the case for the president and against the Democratic process, in particular. The records found several contacts between Nunes, Giuliani, and Giuliani associate Lev Parnas, who has been indicted by federal prosecutors for violating bans on straw and foreign donors. Collins objected to those phone records being included and demanded to know of Goldman who ordered them to be included. He called their inclusion a \"gratuitous drive by\" and a \"smear campaign.\" Rep. Jim Sensenbrenner of Wisconsin went so far as to call it \"a clear abuse of power\" and that those who issued the subpoenas and released the records \"should be ashamed of themselves.\" He then added, \"The surveillance state can get out of control.\" Goldman declined to get into the details of how the investigation was conducted, but said subpoenaing phone records was standard practice in this type of investigation. Progress toward impeachment Nadler's committee will be tasked with writing articles of impeachment against the president that could include abuse of power and bribery, obstruction of Congress and obstruction of justice. \"We'll bring articles of impeachment presumably before the committee at some point later in the week,\" Nadler said Sunday on NBC's Meet The Press. Nadler, though, said he had not yet decided which articles to bring. A sticking point among some Democrats is whether to include findings of the Mueller Russia investigation to support an obstruction of justice article. Republicans led by ranking member Collins have complained all along about the impeachment process and argue that the case about Ukraine not only is meritless, but that Nadler and Democrats have been reckless and sloppy. The Judiciary Committee would charged with introducing, then amending the articles of impeachment. Then, the committee, controlled by Democrats, would vote on whether to send the articles for a vote of the full House. That is expected before Christmas. If a majority of the House supports it, that would trigger a Senate trial, likely in January. Republicans control the upper chamber, and they're expected to acquit Trump. Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., has said he'll convene a trial as required under the Constitution but that he thinks it's \"inconceivable\" that the needed 20 Republicans would break ranks to remove Trump. Trump, for his own part, has said he hopes the House moves quickly to impeach him in order to set up a Senate trial that Republicans could use for their own political purposes. The Trump administration has so far declined to participate in the process.",

As voters head to the polls next week for a crucial general election, Brexit has re-energized the drive for Scotland to leave the United Kingdom. NPR's Frank Langfitt reports from Glasgow. FRANK LANGFITT, BYLINE: As Nicola Sturgeon campaigns for Thursday's election, she has a simple message. Vote for her Scottish National Party so it can push for a second referendum on Scottish independence and vote against Prime Minister Boris Johnson and his Tory party to stop Brexit. NICOLA STURGEON: I think Boris Johnson poses a real threat to Scotland's future. A Boris Johnson government taking Scotland out of the European Union against our will, with all of the damage that will do, is a real and present danger to Scotland's future prosperity. LANGFITT: The English, who make up the vast majority of the United Kingdom's population, swung the Brexit vote in 2016. Many Scots felt like they didn't have any control. STURGEON: Well, Scotland didn't vote for Brexit. We voted overwhelmingly against Brexit and to remain in the European Union. And therefore, independence is about making sure that Scotland controls its own future, doesn't have it decided for us. (SOUNDBITE OF CHEERING) LANGFITT: Sturgeon brought that message to a children's play center in Glasgow on a recent campaign stop, where she posed with kids in a tiny playhouse and sang songs. (SOUNDBITE OF MARACAS SHAKING) STURGEON: (Singing) If you're happy and you know it, roll around. If you're happy and you know it, roll around. LANGFITT: Among the crowd was Lynn Cunnington, a stay-at-home mom. With Brexit looming, Cunnington thinks Scotland is better off inside Europe and outside of the United Kingdom. LYNN CUNNINGTON: I think as an independent country within the European Union, it would be brilliant for Scotland. We need immigration here. We're a small country. We're different from England, and we don't have the same needs. We don't have the same economy. We have the same values sometimes. LANGFITT: England voted for Brexit because many people there wanted to reduce immigration. But Scotland, which has a population less than one-tenth the size, needs and welcomes immigrants. Cunnington also says Scots have a culture and history that's very different from their English neighbors to the south. CUNNINGTON: We always feel like we're more like our northern European counterparts than we are like England. I think England unfortunately still has a hangover from the rule Britannia, Great Britain days. I think very much what I hear from the older generation in England is very much about the war, very much about how, you know, they colonized the world and how - we don't feel like that up here. LANGFITT: Others who live in Scotland feel differently. ANN RUCKLEY: I am British. I have lived in Scotland since 1955, but I'm British. LANGFITT: Ann Ruckley is a retired physician. She's sipping a cappuccino in a cafe in Edinburgh, 50 miles east of Glasgow. RUCKLEY: I would vote to stay in the United Kingdom because I think we'd do better. I mean, look what the Brexit referendum has done - divided people. And then are we going to have a border between Scotland and England? It doesn't make any sense. RONALD MACDONALD: Well, my view would be that it is far too costly to become independent. LANGFITT: Ronald MacDonald teaches economics at Glasgow University. He says a newly independent Scotland would face a currency crisis. For instance, without the United Kingdom, MacDonald says Scotland won't have enough foreign reserves to support its own currency and would be forced to devalue, causing a lot of economic pain for ordinary citizens. MACDONALD: You would see people potentially having to pay 30% more for mortgages, perhaps. They would see their pensions hit if they were denominated in Scots pounds - so very, very severe implications. (SOUNDBITE OF DOORKNOB CLICKING) LANGFITT: Hi, Professor Henderson. AILSA HENDERSON: Hello. LANGFITT: I'm Frank. Nice to meet you. HENDERSON: Hello, Frank. Hi. LANGFITT: Ailsa Henderson is a professor of political science at the University of Edinburgh. She says the ties that bind the U.K. are increasingly strained. HENDERSON: You can see cracks in the union. You can see it in sustained high levels of dissatisfaction in Scotland. LANGFITT: But Henderson says any push for independence has a ways to go. In the 2014 referendum, independence was defeated by 10 percentage points. An Ipsos Mori poll last month found voters evenly split on the issue. Henderson says the future of the United Kingdom will become clear once the nature of Brexit does. HENDERSON: If it's a hard Brexit and it poses all kinds of economic difficulties, then it could be a series of dominoes in a way. But one thing I would say is that if the union can survive this, then it would seem almost to be indestructible. LANGFITT: Britain's voted three years ago to break with the European Union. One of the big questions now is whether that decision will lead to the breakup of their own country. Frank Langfitt, NPR News, Glasgow. Copyright \u00a9 2019 NPR.  All rights reserved.

            "article_content": "Demonstrators protest against what they call \"red media\" influence in Taiwan during a rally against pro-China media in front of the president's office building in Taipei on June 23.\n                \n                    \n                    Hsu Tsun-hsu/AFP via Getty Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption Demonstrators protest against what they call \"red media\" influence in Taiwan during a rally against pro-China media in front of the president's office building in Taipei on June 23. Updated Dec. 13 at 10:07 a.m. ET Eye Central Television is a popular satirical TV news show in Taiwan with an active social media presence. One day in April, it received a Facebook message from someone using the name Tina Hsu, but this was no ordinary fan. Hsu's Facebook profile was blank; it had just been created that morning. And Hsu made a surprising proposition: to buy EyeCTV's Facebook admin rights, taking control of the content shared with its more than 420,000 followers. At first, the political satire program, reminiscent of The Daily Show, played along. \"We jokingly asked for 1.4 billion Taiwan dollars [$46 million],\" says show writer Sandra Ho \u2014 requesting a number that matches the population of China, she notes. EyeCTV didn't sell out in the end. Many in the Taiwanese media suspect the proposition and others like it are part of a Chinese state-backed influence campaign. Dozens of Facebook pages in Taiwan have become content mills for Chinese Communist Party propaganda. Taiwan is now the liberal democracy that receives the most disinformation spread by a foreign government, according to a May report from the University of Gothenburg in Sweden. The stakes for curbing the propaganda are especially high right now in Taiwan, a self-governing island that Beijing says belongs to the People's Republic of China. In January, Taiwan will vote for its president and legislators. Its current leaders are determined to avoid a repeat of the 2018 local elections, which were marred by suspicions of Chinese interference. But to filter false content, Taiwan faces free speech concerns that other countries, such as the United States, also have encountered. Fact-checking Facebook One of the latest efforts against disinformation is a unique collaboration between Facebook and the Taiwan FactCheck Center. The nonprofit center uses a back-end tool provided by Facebook to track viral, misleading posts and works to fact-check them. Once it does, Facebook alerts anyone who shared the post that it was wrong and includes a link to the fact-check article below the false post. \"Journalists focus on the truth, on describing something that happened. But for us, we want to prove that something has not happened. That's much harder to do,\" says Summer Chen, the editor-in-chief of the Taiwan FactCheck Center. The initiative comes as the government is getting tough on disinformation, including steep fines for those caught spreading it. Joseph Wu, Taiwan's foreign minister.\n                \n                    \n                    Sam Yeh/AFP via Getty Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption Joseph Wu, Taiwan's foreign minister. \"It's not only a domestic effort or a [Taiwanese] government interagency effort. There's also an international effort\" to ward off Beijing's influence campaigns, Joseph Wu, Taiwan's foreign minister, tells NPR. \"Because of the experiences we have, we have also built up some of the most formidable defense capabilities in the world.\" In April, Taiwan's broadcast regulator fined a TV station more than $32,000 for not verifying an inaccurate news item before airing it. Dozens of individuals also have been fined for sharing harmful, false items on social media. The crackdown comes amid rising suspicion of mainland Chinese influence in Taiwan's news media. In June, thousands marched against what protest organizers called the \"threats of infiltration\" by Chinese Communist \"red media\" in Taiwan's democracy. Later that month, Taiwan refused entry of a TV journalist from the mainland who allegedly broadcast misleading reports. Regulators are currently discussing blocking video-streaming sites run by Chinese companies Baidu and Tencent from broadcasting in Taiwan. No name, no location There's a central challenge for regulators: Most disinformation coming into Taiwan is through anonymous, hard-to-detect social media accounts. Last year, when Taiwanese officials were falsely accused of abandoning Taiwanese tourists stranded by Typhoon Jebi in Osaka, Japan, the story was first spread by an anonymous user on PTT, a messaging forum popular in Taiwan. Within a day, several Taiwanese evening talk shows had picked up the item. Furious residents heaped criticism on the Taiwanese government's representative in Osaka, Su Chii-cherng. He killed himself soon after, reportedly leaving a note that said he had been troubled by the news. Researchers say some of the misleading material, including a doctored image, shows signs of being created in mainland China. In early December, a Taiwanese court criminally charged a social media influencer and a blogger for spreading the false information on various digital networks. The influencer is identified by local media as Slow Yang, the leader of an \"Internet army\" that supports President Tsai Ing-wen's Democratic Progressive Party. Tracing influence campaigns back to Beijing is difficult though, says Audrey Tang, Taiwan's digital minister. Social media users and hackers can use software to conceal their location. One giveaway on Twitter, Tang says, is when users in mainland China are able to access the site, normally blocked by China's Internet firewall, without help from such software. Using Taiwanese slang Puma Shen runs DoubleThink Labs, a research outfit monitoring how false information travels from content farms funded by Chinese state or party-run entities to Facebook fan pages to news shows in Taiwan, and broadcast to an unsuspecting public. Shen says one tactic he sees is an online \"subliminal attack\" to sway voters. Hundreds of hackers search one candidate's name over and over again to slant search engine algorithms toward displaying their results more prominently than other candidates'. One day, Shen predicts China will surpass Russia in global disinformation operations. \"It's not really hard to do that,\" Shen says, pointing to Chinese-run apps such as short video platform TikTok, now under U.S. investigation for collecting American user data, and messaging app WeChat. \"[China] has all these marketing groups' online shopping apps which can easily collect private information on citizens in other countries.\" China's influence efforts have advanced rapidly since the last Taiwanese municipal elections in 2018. Some messages stood out because they used mainland Chinese text, written in a simplified alphabet, in contrast with the traditional characters used in Taiwan, researchers say. Now, disinformation posts written in fluent Taiwanese slang are shared through private social media channels rather than publicly. Rights concerns C\u00e9dric Alviani, the head of Reporters Without Borders' East Asia bureau in Taipei, warns that coercive measures against media, including fining news outlets, are counterproductive: \"By doing this kind of thing, the Taiwanese authorities are actually doing the exact same thing as they criticize,\" he says. He's referring to how Taiwan is using top-down methods to control undesirable speech comparable to what China's Communist Party does. Alviani advocates for allowing people and outlets to dispute their fines or revoked credentials. He also says Taiwanese media need more funds to pay for good journalism, rather than rely on social media for news. \"People don't trust so much their media because the line between the media and entertainment is very blurred in Taiwan,\" Alviani contends. \"[Outlets] have an undue pressure to generate audience to their articles.\" Government officials say they are aware of concerns that the disinformation crackdown could hinder freedom of the press and expression. \"I think when people still remember the martial law like I do, we just don't want to go back there,\" says Tang, the digital minister. The former authoritarian government enforced martial law for almost 40 years until 1987. Tang says her parents were journalists and had to work under censorship during that period. As the government passes tougher legislation to protect Taiwan, it risks affecting the civil liberties Taiwanese have enjoyed for three decades. \"Maybe it's impossible to legislate social media,\" concedes Ketty Chen, vice president of the government think tank Taiwan Foundation for Democracy. \"As democracies, a challenge we often face is how you can legislate an individual's right to expression and the freedom of media [and] freedom of journalists to report, to investigate.\" Greg Dixon and Kwang Yin Liu contributed reporting from Taiwan.

Kamala Harris is dropping out of the 2020 presidential race after her support and funding fell in recent months. Updated at 3:25 p.m. ET California Sen. Kamala Harris is dropping out of the presidential race, citing a lack of funds. She informed her campaign staff of the decision on a conference call and later sent an email to supporters, in which she wrote \"my campaign for president simply doesn't have the financial resources we need to continue.\" Harris' departure, two months before voting and caucusing begin in the presidential contest, marks an abrupt end to a campaign that, for much of the winter and spring, looked like that of a top-tier presidential contender. \"I've taken stock, and I've looked at this from every angle, and over the last few days, I have come to one of the hardest decisions of my life,\" Harris said in a video announcing her decision. \"As the campaign has gone on, it has become harder and harder to raise the money we need to compete.\" Harris kicked off her campaign in front of 20,000 supporters in Oakland, Calif., and consistently drew large crowds in Iowa, South Carolina, and other early primary states. She was among the top tier of candidates in both polling and fundraising and briefly surged toward the very top of the field shortly after the first presidential debate, when she confronted former Vice President Joe Biden about his early opposition to federal busing policies. But that exchange was a high-water mark of sorts for her campaign, and as Harris dropped in the polls over the summer and fall, she had to lay off campaign staff and all but shutter operations in New Hampshire, and she struggled to raise money from donors. Harris, who came from behind in the polls in her runs for both San Francisco district attorney and California attorney general, tried to stay in the race by focusing her efforts on Iowa but ultimately ended her bid exactly two months before the caucuses there. Amid a crowded field filled with both moderate and progressive candidates, Harris struggled to carve out her own policy lane. She shifted positions several times on a defining issue for Democrats: health care. Harris initially backed the total elimination of private health insurance, only to later roll out a health care plan that allowed private plans as long as they met government standards. Harris backtracked in several other high-profile moments, including her criticism of Biden's anti-busing stances as a senator. She later admitted that her views of the federal government's role in setting local policies was essentially the same as Biden's. Still, Harris was one of only seven candidates to qualify for December's debate. At the moment, nine days before the deadline, no other nonwhite candidate has qualified for the debate stage. That means that after a historically diverse field of candidates entered the Democratic primary race, the next debate is likely to consist of all white candidates.",

After months of protests, pro-democracy candidates in Hong Kong appeared on course to make major gains in local elections on Sunday in what many activists are calling a rebuke of Beijing. Results for Hong Kong's district council elections trickled in well into Monday morning local time as residents gathered in the streets to pop champagne and celebrate winning candidates. Early returns showed pro-democracy candidates taking at least 201 of 452 district council seats, up from 124. Hong Kong's district councilors typically handle municipal projects like collecting garbage, maintaining parks and repairing street lights. But with anti-government protests now in their sixth month, the results of these low-level elections have been closely watched. On Sunday, long lines wrapped around city blocks as voters rushed to the polls in record turn out. The city reported that more than 2.9 million people voted, a turnout rate of more than 71%. More people voted in Sunday's local election than any election in Hong Kong to date. Let the voting begin! Line wraps around the block #hongkong #districtelections pic.twitter.com/oeAxT7UnA0 Joshua Wong, a pro-democracy activist, on Twitter called the results \"historic.\" \"Hong Kongers have spoken out, loud and clear,\" he wrote. \"The international community must acknowledge that, almost six months in, public opinion has NOT turned against the movement.\" This is historic. Early returns suggest a landslide victory for the opposition camp. Hong Kongers have spoken out, loud and clear. The international community must acknowledge that, almost six months in, public opinion has NOT turned against the movement. https://t.co/zHFfC85YgC Early in the night, pro-democracy candidates scored several upset victories. In many cases, first-time candidates and protest veterans defeated longtime pro-Beijing legislators. \"This is the power of democracy. This is a democratic tsunami,\" said Tommy Cheung, a former student protest leader who won a seat in the Yuen Long district near the border with Mainland China. Many analysts viewed Sunday's elections as a test for public support of the protests. Clashes between demonstrators and police have become increasingly violent in recent weeks. Earlier this month, pro-democracy protesters hurled gasoline bombs and police used tear gas and water cannons during a standoff at the Hong Kong Polytechnic University campus. The protests in Hong Kong began in June, when an extradition bill that would have allowed suspected criminals to be sent to Mainland China drew millions of demonstrators to the streets. Hong Kong's chief executive, Carrie Lam, ultimately withdrew the bill. As NPR's Emily Feng has reported, activists viewed that move as insufficient and throughout the protest movement have called for direct elections of the chief executive and an independent inquiry into police tactics. Against this backdrop, the district elections have taken on an outsize significance, and voters have mobilized in unprecedented fashion. Government\u00a0voter registration statistics\u00a0show that more than 4.1 million people were registered to vote Sunday in a city of around 7.4 million, the highest level ever recorded. For the first time ever, all 452 elected district councilor seats are being contested as many first-time, pan-democratic, or pro-democracy, candidates run for office. And district councilors are not entirely powerless.About a quarter of them, 117, also sit on the 1,200-member council that elects the city's chief executive. District councilors also are allocated six seats on the city's 70-person Legislative Council, which sets policy. Pan-democrats are hoping that by electing a majority in the district councils, they may be able to tip Hong Kong's historically pro-Beijing lawmaking bodies in their favor. Roy Kwong Chun-yu, who beat out a pro-Beijing rival for a councilor seat in the Yuen Long district, told the South China Morning Post that the results in Sunday's elections are a symbol of public support for the demands of the pro-democracy movement. Those demands include direct elections for Hong Kong's next leader and an independent investigation of the police response to the protests. \"The voice of the public is loud and clear. Five demands, not one less,\" he said. \"We hope the government can heed the protesters' demands.\"",

Updated at 2:45 a.m. ET WednesdayDemocrats had a strong election night on Tuesday, leading the race for governor in Kentucky and taking back full control of the Virginia legislature for the first time in nearly a quarter century. With all precincts reporting in Kentucky, Democrat Andy Beshear bested Republican Gov. Matt Bevin by 5,198 votes, or 0.36% of all votes cast. While The Associated Press says the race is too close to call, Beshear declared victory. Bevin refused to concede. If Beshear's margin holds, it's a blow to President Trump, who rallied in the state for Bevin on the eve of the election. Loading... Beshear, the attorney general of Kentucky, was able to drive up turnout in the commonwealth's urban and suburban centers and received stronger-than-expected numbers in some rural areas. His lead suggested voters are still willing to make a distinction between state and federal races, even in a hyperpartisan political environment. \"Our elections don't have to be about right versus left. They can still be about right versus wrong,\" Beshear said as he claimed victory. Bevin's second-place position also suggests there may be limits to Trump's typically uncanny ability to turn out his base for a candidate. Kentucky is a GOP stronghold at the federal level, having gone for Trump by 30 points in 2016, but has a long history of electing Democrats at the state level. When he won in 2015, Bevin became just the third Republican governor in Kentucky since World War II. However, Kentucky Republicans won all of the state's other constitutional offices on Tuesday, further evidence that this contest was more of a referendum on Bevin than a party shift. As governor, Bevin made plenty of enemies while doing little to make friends. His approval ratings showed him to be one of the most unpopular governors in the country, and he only narrowly won his primary over a little-known opponent. Bevin picked fights with and offended Kentucky teachers over pension reform, resulting in a major voter backlash. Even his relationships with GOP state legislators were rocky. Bevin focused on national issues in the race, touting himself as stridently anti-abortion and tough on illegal immigrants, with his ads showing menacing-looking gang members pouring over U.S. borders. He highlighted his support for Trump and was a vocal opponent of the impeachment inquiry in the U.S. House of Representatives. Beshear's father Steve was a popular Democratic governor who immediately preceded Bevin and had expanded Medicaid in Kentucky under the Affordable Care Act. Bevin tried to roll back access to Medicaid by implementing work requirements. During the campaign, Beshear pledged to restore \"respect\" and \"Kentucky values\" to the governor's office, and to protect Medicaid expansion and education funding, focusing the race on state and local issues instead of the nationalized vote Bevin wanted. Virginia legislature turns blue In Virginia, Democrats' victories showed that the commonwealth is moving away from its swing-state status and more firmly into the blue column. The legislative wins gave Democrats control of state government, as they now hold the governorship along with both houses of the Virginia General Assembly. Those new Democratic majorities could lead to greater gun control measures, further expansions to Medicaid and a shot at becoming the final state needed to ratify the Equal Rights Amendment. New court-ordered district lines redrawn earlier this year in the state House helped Democrats flip the chamber along with the state Senate. Now that they're in control, Democrats can help determine congressional and legislative district lines in the future. The battle for control of the statehouse in Virginia attracted big money \u2014 some individual races raised more than $2 million \u2014 and big names. Just last weekend Vice President Pence and former Vice President Joe Biden held events in the state for their respective parties. Democrats won majorities in both houses of the General Assembly despite scandals affecting the three top statewide officials in their party. Attorney General Mark Herring admitted earlier this year to wearing blackface when he was younger; Gov. Ralph Northam admitted to darkening his face in 1984 to impersonate Michael Jackson in a dance contest; and two women have accused Lt. Gov. Justin Fairfax of sexual assault, which he denies. GOP success in Mississippi Republicans did have a good night in Mississippi, keeping an open-seat race in their column as Lt. Gov. Tate Reeves defeated Democratic Attorney General Jim Hood for governor. The race was closer than usual in Mississippi, with Hood playing up his opposition to abortion rights and gun control while also campaigning to expand Medicaid in the state, which Reeves opposed. Reeves' campaign got a boost when Trump campaigned in Tupelo, Miss., for him last Friday ahead of the election. The GOP also swept all the down-ballot races \u2014 marking the first time since Reconstruction that Republicans will hold all statewide offices. Don't see the graphic above? Click here.

Elizabeth Warren and South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg during a Democratic presidential debate.\n                \n                    \n                    John Minchillo/AP\n                    \n                \nhide caption Democratic presidential candidates (from left): Sen. Bernie Sanders, former Vice President Joe Biden, Sen. Elizabeth Warren and South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg during a Democratic presidential debate. It's happening again. Democrats are wringing their hands, wondering who else might be out there? Michelle Obama? Sherrod Brown? Mike Bloomberg? Hillary Clinton? Oprah? Democrats do this mental gymnastics nearly every election cycle \u2014 is there anyone not running for president who is better than who is running and can definitely win in a general election? Some real talk, though, after conversations with veteran Democratic strategists \u2014 as a Trump administration official might put it: \"Get over it.\" \"This is the field,\" said Jamal Simmons, a former adviser to the Democratic National Committee during Barack Obama's 2008 presidential run. \"There were 24 candidates who were running. So Democrats had a lot of choices.\" These campaign veterans, not connected with any current campaigns, are more optimistic about the group than many others in the Democratic establishment. They say, sure, there are vulnerabilities, but there are always vulnerabilities with candidates in every election cycle. What's more, they say, the top candidates are showing strength against Trump nationally and in key states, for the most part, they are getting better as candidates and are \"talented, hard-working, telegenic, smart, and inspiring,\" said a former Obama official and campaign veteran who did not want to be named in order to speak openly about the field. \"My one concern is this trend to lurch outside the mainstream on a handful of issues,\" this Democrat said, pointing to policies like decriminalization of border crossings, \"Medicare for All\" as a replacement to private health insurance and packing the Supreme Court. All are unpopular with a general-election electorate. \"Democrats win when we are the party of common sense,\" the Obama official said, noting that Hillary Clinton and Obama made sure not to adopt policies outside the mainstream in the 2008 primary race. \"Some of these ideas are going to scare all those suburban women that delivered us 2018.\" This hand-wringing seems to happen every presidential election. Karen Finney Democrats took back the House in 2018 by flipping more than three dozen seats held by Republicans, many of which were in right-leaning districts. With Democrats in the House going down the impeachment path, some in the party are holding their breath to see how that plays with the general-election electorate. So far, independents have flipped and started to trend with Democrats on at least approving of the impeachment inquiry. \"This hand-wringing seems to happen every presidential election \u2014 perhaps more acute this time because of the threat Trump poses to our country and the strong desire to beat him,\" said Karen Finney, a Democratic strategist who worked on the 2016 Clinton campaign and was an adviser to Stacey Abrams during her bid for Georgia governor in 2018. High anxiety There are undoubtedly vulnerabilities of the current field. Former Vice President Joe Biden, who led in national polls for most of this year, has stumbled in debates; his fundraising has been unimpressive; and young voters have little affection for him. Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren is seen as too liberal by some, especially because of her support for Medicare for All as a replacement to private insurance. And there's the complication of no woman ever having been president of the United States. (Whether Warren's gender would help or hurt her is an arguable point worthy of another column.) Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders retains a loyal following, and he continues to be a fundraising juggernaut with the love and admiration of young progressives. But his favorability ratings with a general-election electorate are not good, as a recent NPR/PBS NewsHour/Marist poll found. And nothing polls worse for a characteristic of a candidate, an NBC/WSJ poll found, than a socialist or someone older than 75. There is buzz again around South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg after a strong debate performance and a sizable bank of cash on hand ($30 million). While he favors more poll-tested policy positions, he has less experience on the national stage, is the mayor of a town of only about 100,000 people, has had his own challenges during his tenure winning over people of color that have translated to this campaign \u2014 and he's only 37 years old. This week, pieces in both the New York Times and Washington Post put the concerns of some high-profile Democrats on full display. \"There's more anxiety than ever,\" Connie Schultz, the journalist and spouse of the aforementioned Ohio Sen. Brown, told the Times. (She also noted that there are calls for her husband to reconsider.) The anxiety is palpable to former New Orleans Mayor Mitch Landrieu: \"I can see it, I can feel it, I can hear it,\" he noted in the Times. \"You can imagine much stronger candidates,\" Elaine Kamarck, a longtime DNC member, told the Post. She prefers a more moderate figure like Brown, who has said being in favor of Medicare for All as a replacement to private insurance is a bad idea, because it's unpopular in a place like Ohio. Late entries rarely work Kamarck also floated Adm. William H. McRaven, who was in charge of the raid that killed Osama bin Laden. McRaven penned an op-ed in the Times last week, headlined, \"Our Republic Is Under Attack From the President.\" But running a late-entry military leader into the Democratic primary has been tried before. In 2004, nervous Democrats urged Gen. Wesley Clark to launch an ill-fated campaign, because they didn't like that someone viewed as too liberal was ahead (Gov. Howard Dean of Vermont) and the other leading candidate was seen as too uninspiring (John Kerry). Kerry, of course, won the nomination but lost in the general election. Sound like familiar concerns? Nothing is perfectly symmetrical, though. The country then was in the middle of a war, with a president asking Americans to \"stay the course\" three years after the country's worst terrorist attacks in its history on Sept. 11. George W. Bush's approval rating in the last Gallup poll before Election Day was still 48%. It eventually hit 57% in early 2005 before nosediving, as the Iraq war spiraled. That and an economic collapse led to Obama's 2008 victory. The Clark experiment, launched in September 2003, failed. Just ask Simmons. He was part of that campaign. \"Wes Clark was a product of Democratic hand-wringing, because of Howard Dean and John Kerry,\" Simmons said. \"All these Clinton people surrounded him and tried to build a campaign, and let me just say, it didn't really work out so well.\" Clark's campaign never really worked out for lots of reasons \u2014 he was a political novice, fundraising was difficult, his loyalty to the Democratic Party was questioned and he lacked a natural charisma and constituency. He wound up finishing third in the New Hampshire primary, far behind Kerry and Dean. He dropped out shortly after. \"History would sort of argue it's too late\" now for someone else to get in, Simmons said. A constant state of worry In 2016, there was one narrative that would never quite go away \u2014 whether one particular candidate would jump in and save the party from the Clinton email scandal. Ironically, that was none other than Joe Biden, the man the party establishment is now so worried about because of his lackluster fundraising (just $9 million cash on hand) and spotty debate performances. Clinton did win 3 million more votes than Trump; they were just in some of the wrong places. In 2007 and 2008, some were apprehensive that a young, inexperienced black Democrat couldn't beat a war hero. Obama, it should be remembered, went on to not only win the presidency once, but reelection as the only person to do so with at least 51% of Americans' vote twice since Eisenhower. The last time a late entry worked The last person to get into the race this late and get the nomination was in 1992 when Arkansas Gov. Bill Clinton got into the race in October 1991. \"That's the last time that worked, and we didn't have email addresses,\" Simmons said. \"We were carrying cellphones around in duffel bags.\" What's more, Clinton's entry was after a sleepy summer in the primary when other potentially major candidates declined to run. Clinton himself faced party hand-wringing with rumors of infidelity highlighted by the Gennifer Flowers saga and because of accusations of being a Vietnam draft dodger. Clinton won the presidency twice. Democratic voters seem to like their field All that said, an important point that shouldn't be lost is that Democratic voters don't seem all that dissatisfied with the field. The top candidates get very high favorability ratings from Democrats, as the NPR poll has shown. And, as Pew found earlier this summer, two-thirds of Democratic voters (65%) had either an excellent or good impression of the field. That's 14 points higher than 2016 on par with 2008. \"It's still early,\" Finney noted. \"Politicos forget that voters are still getting to know the candidates, and there's still time for someone to have a breakout moment.\" The dings and bruises of a primary, she argued, will be good for the eventual nominee. \"We can't be afraid that our eventual nominee will get too beat up in a primary,\" Finney said. \"This is the time for the campaigns to deal with issues, because they will face the same attacks on a much larger, harsher scale in the general, so better to be prepared and know how to fight it. \"Look at how much stronger Obama was in 2008 after the primary.\"",

            "article_content": "The U.S. is likely to keep some troops in northern Syria. The acting U.S. ambassador to Ukraine is to testify in the impeachment inquiry. Justin Trudeau wins a second term as Canada's prime minister.  RACHEL MARTIN, HOST: The U.S. may have been the one to broker this temporary cease-fire between Turkey and Kurds in Syria, but that pause comes to an end today. And now Turkey is consulting Russia about its next steps. NOEL KING, HOST: Right. You'll remember the fighting started after President Trump moved U.S. troops out of the border region. And there have been these concerns about who's going to fill the power vacuum - Turkey, which is now bombing the Syrian Kurds who fought with the United States against ISIS, or the Syrian regime, led by Bashar al-Assad or, by extension, Russia or even ISIS, which could regroup. So President Trump is taking a lot of heat on this decision. And now acting Defense Secretary Mark Esper says some U.S. troops will stay in Syria. MARTIN: Joining us now, NPR's Pentagon correspondent Tom Bowman. Good morning, Tom. TOM BOWMAN, BYLINE: Hey, Rachel. MARTIN: So President Trump had wanted all U.S. troops out of Syria. Now that's not happening apparently. Is the Pentagon going rogue here? Or has this plan to keep some U.S. troops behind already - is this already something Trump has approved? BOWMAN: Well, it's really uncertain yet. And the U.S. troops are leaving, some heading into Iraq. And Trump said at a Cabinet meeting that keeping troops in Syria was not necessary, quote, \"other than that we secure the oil.\" And Defense Secretary Mark Esper picked up on that. Let's listen. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) MARK ESPER: This withdrawal will take weeks, not days. Until that time, our forces will remain in the towns that are located near the oil fields. The purpose of those forces - a purpose of those forces working with the SDF is to deny access to those oil fields by ISIS and others. BOWMAN: Now, those oil fields are not up in the area where the Turkish militia groups are creating a safe zone. But they're down in a southern area where there are oil fields that are currently being secured by Kurdish forces with help from the United States. And there are estimates that maybe a couple of hundred American troops will remain out of the total number of a thousand American troops that were in Syria. MARTIN: So the focus is supposed to be on these oil fields that aren't even near the border. But are the fields actually under threat from ISIS? BOWMAN: You know, not at this point. It was Russian mercenaries, not ISIS, that tried to grab these oil fields early last year. Of course, Russia is allied with the Syrian government of Bashar al-Assad. Now, Rachel, I was in Syria at the time talking with the Kurdish commander about this. He said some 500 Russian mercenaries were firing artillery toward an American-Kurdish base. And they were trying to seize oil fields with plans to head in that direction. But this Kurdish commander, General Hassan (ph), said a Russian military officer denied any Russian involvement. Here he is talking through an interpreter. UNIDENTIFIED PERSON: (Through interpreter) We are sure they know that - I mean the Russian - but they are deny. They say, we don't have any force up there. We are not involving in that fighting. BOWMAN: But those Russian mercenaries were pummeled by American airstrikes and withdrew. Some 250 were killed. And the Kurdish commander then said the Russian officer called him and asked if they could come and pick up their dead. MARTIN: OK. Just worth repeating again - today, Turkey's Erdogan is in Moscow meeting with Vladimir Putin, underscoring the precariousness of this entire situation. Tom, just where does this whole thing leave the Kurds in this moment? Because the cease-fire is now over today, right? BOWMAN: That's right. It's over today. And it leaves the Kurds vulnerable to these Turkish militia forces. And frankly, some of the Kurdish civilians are pretty bitter about all this. And they've been throwing rotten vegetables at the U.S. military vehicles as they're leaving. And to complicate this even more, Rachel, Iraq is not sure they want any more U.S. forces heading into their country. So it's very, very complicated and not going to end anytime soon. MARTIN: All right. NPR Pentagon correspondent Tom Bowman for us. Thanks, Tom. We appreciate it. BOWMAN: You're welcome, Rachel. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) MARTIN: OK. William Taylor, the acting U.S. ambassador to Ukraine, left a sort of paper trail. Did he do it on purpose? KING: House investigators might ask him that today. He's going to be testifying behind closed doors in the impeachment inquiry. House Democrats are investigating whether President Trump held up U.S. military aid to Ukraine unless the government there investigated Joe Biden and the DNC. Now, Taylor's text messages, some of which are now public, suggests that he was troubled by the appearance of a quid pro quo. MARTIN: To walk us through what to expect from today's testimony, we are joined by NPR diplomatic correspondent Michele Kelemen. Hi, Michele. MICHELE KELEMEN, BYLINE: Good morning. MARTIN: First off, just tell us a little more about Ambassador Taylor. Who is he? KELEMEN: So he's a Vietnam War veteran. And he spent much of his career in the State Department. Taylor was actually the ambassador to Ukraine over a decade ago. Before that, he worked on aid programs in the region. So he really knows all the players there. He was brought back to run the embassy, rather reluctantly, after Marie Yovanovitch was withdrawn. She was the ambassador who was facing a smear campaign led by Trump's private lawyer, Rudy Giuliani. MARTIN: So, I mean, he knows Ukraine, right? As you just laid out, he's been working there for a long time. How does he think about the country? What are his views concerning Ukraine? KELEMEN: Well, we actually know quite a bit about his views because he co-authored a bunch of op-eds in recent years about helping Ukraine counter Russian aggression. Taylor supported the idea of providing defensive weapons to Ukraine, which the Trump administration did. Though, it held up some of that aid this summer for a bit. He even weighed in on the new president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, in a podcast for the U.S. Institute of Peace. Just take a listen. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) WILLIAM TAYLOR: The new president - the president-elect is getting a lot of support from the international community. And, as people told me over and over, the Americans are key. KELEMEN: So that was right after Zelenskiy, who was a comedian before he entered politics, won the election. Taylor had been an election monitor and seemed enthusiastic about Zelenskiy's anti-corruption campaign. But back in Washington, President Trump seems to have had a pretty dim view of Ukraine, reinforced, we're learning now, by a visit by Hungary's leader. Remember, Trump was trying to get out from under the cloud of the Robert Mueller investigation into Russia's intervention... MARTIN: Right. KELEMEN: ...In the 2016 election. And he and his private lawyer, Giuliani, have been pointing to Ukraine. MARTIN: Trying to suggest that it was Ukraine that interfered and to diminish Russia's role in the 2016 elections. KELEMEN: Right. MARTIN: So then there's William Taylor and text messages, right? Remind us how he fits into all this. KELEMEN: Yeah. So early in the impeachment inquiry, the House committees released a series of messages, some of which were written by Taylor. In one, he says that President Zelenskiy is sensitive about being seen as an instrument in U.S. politics. In another, he wrote, rather bluntly, I think it's crazy to withhold security assistance for help with a political campaign. Remember, he was a supporter of this aid, which was, as we mentioned, delayed. MARTIN: Right. So what are House investigators - what are they going to try to find out from him today? KELEMEN: Well, you know, a lot of the - his former colleagues see him as kind of the hero of this story so far because it seemed he was, through these text messages, creating a record of what's going on. Lawmakers and their staffers are going to want to get a full picture of his understanding of why U.S. aid was being held up. And he would also have insight, by the way, into what Ukrainian officials were telling him about that and what - and whether they really felt under pressure. MARTIN: All right. NPR's Michele Kelemen. Thanks, Michele. KELEMEN: Sure thing. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) MARTIN: All right. He apologized for a blackface scandal, was found guilty of attempting to obstruct justice, upset his liberal base by expanding an oil pipeline in western Canada. We're talking about Canada's prime minister, Justin Trudeau, who has won the day, won a second term as Canada's prime minister. Here's what he promises in his next term. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) PRIME MINISTER JUSTIN TRUDEAU: We will make life more affordable. We will continue to fight climate change. We will get guns off our streets. And we will keep investing in Canadians. (CHEERING) KING: Trudeau fought a tight race against Conservatives. And that message of hope and change that won him his seat in 2015 didn't seem to have the same resonance (ph) this time around. His Liberal Party couldn't form a majority government in Canada's House of Commons. MARTIN: Joining us now, reporter David McGuffin from Ottawa covering all of this. Hi, David. DAVID MCGUFFIN, BYLINE: Hi. Good morning. MARTIN: So help us understand the results. Trudeau did not fare as well as he had hoped. What happened? MCGUFFIN: Yeah. Well, he went into this campaign thinking he would actually sail back to victory fairly easily, and that clearly didn't happen. He lost about 21 seats. And he's lost his parliamentary majority. All that's likely tied to the political and personal scandals he's been involved in in the last year... MARTIN: Right. MCGUFFIN: ...Which were fairly serious. He's now effectively been put in check by the opposition parties. And I think that's basically what voters were saying. Like, you need to shape up. We're sort of putting you on notice. And that was also the message really, too, from the Conservative leader, Andrew Scheer, as he gave his concession speech in the early hours of this morning. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) ANDREW SCHEER: Conservatives have put Justin Trudeau on notice. And, Mr. Trudeau, when your government falls, Conservatives will be ready. And we will win. (CHEERING) MARTIN: I mean, considering how tight it was and all these scandals, how did Trudeau pull this out? MCGUFFIN: Yeah. And there was an assumption here, really, up until late last week that the Conservatives would win at least a minority government. But part of the problem was the Conservatives' own leader, Andrew Scheer, just didn't warm to voters. There was concerns about his social conservatism. He's against abortion rights, which is not a popular stance amongst most Canadians. He also heavily downplayed the need to fight climate change. His was the only party that did that. His party's power base is in oil-rich Alberta. But that also wasn't a popular stance here. Climate was at the center of most of the party's platform. So - and also, Trudeau wound up being helped by strategic voting on the left. Voters of the New Democratic Party, which had been surging in the polls - it's a left-leaning party under their popular leader Jagmeet Singh - they appear to have decided to vote strategically for the Liberals as a way to - preventing a Conservative government coming in. MARTIN: So it was less about Trudeau himself as an individual and more about just securing the party's future. What happens, though, I mean, as Trudeau now has to make some compromises? MCGUFFIN: Yeah. He's got to work - basically he's got to work I think with the New Democratic Party. They - together they have enough votes to get bills through Parliament. Minority governments aren't that unusual in Canada... MARTIN: OK. MCGUFFIN: ...But we're expecting an election probably in the next 18 months to two years. MARTIN: All right. David McGuffin for us, covering the results of Canada's national elections. David, we appreciate it. MCGUFFIN: Thank you. (SOUNDBITE OF NOMO'S \"NU TONES\") Copyright \u00a9 2019 NPR.

            "article_content": "A contractor bulldozes a 60-foot-wide construction zone along the border, toppling saguaro cacti.\n                \n                    \n                    John Burnett/NPR\n                    \n                \nhide caption A contractor bulldozes a 60-foot-wide construction zone along the border, toppling saguaro cacti. Construction has begun on President Trump's border wall between Arizona and Mexico, and conservationists are furious. The massive barrier will skirt one of the most beloved protected areas in the Southwest \u2014 Organ Pipe Cactus National Monument, recognized by the United Nations as an international biosphere reserve. On a recent drive along the borderline, a crew was transplanting tall saguaro cactus out of the construction zone. \"There may be misconceptions that we are on a construction site and just not caring for the environment,\" intones a voice on a video released by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, which is overseeing the project. \"We are relocating saguaro, organ pipe, ocotillo...\" But a half-mile away, a big yellow bulldozer was scraping the desert clean and mowing down cactus columns that were likely older than the young man operating the dozer. Customs and Border Protection later said 110 desert plants have been relocated, and unhealthy ones get bulldozed. This scene illustrates why environmentalists are deeply skeptical of the government's plans. They fear that as CBP and the Defense Department race to meet the president's deadline of 450 miles of wall by Election Day 2020, they will plow through one of the most biologically and culturally rich regions of the continental United States. The U.S. Fish & Wildlife Service has warned that the wall, with its bright lights, human activity and impermeable barrier, could negatively impact 23 endangered and at-risk species, including the Sonoran pronghorn antelope.  And the National Park Service says construction could destroy 22 archaeological sites. Yet, for this stretch of western desert, the government has waived 41 federal environmental laws to expedite construction. \"This is a wall to fulfill a campaign promise. It's really clear. And that's what makes so many of us so angry. It's being done so fast outside the rule of law and we know it'll have an incredible impact,\" says Kevin Dahl, Arizona representative for the National Parks Conservation Association. He sits beside a serene, spring-fed pond fringed by cattails, and dive-bombed by dragonflies. It is called Quitobaquito Springs,  and it's located on the southern edge of the Organ Pipe Cactus National Monument. Quitobaquito Springs, inside the Organ Pipe Cactus National Monument, is listed by the United Nations as an international biosphere reserve.\n                \n                    \n                    John Burnett/NPR\n                    \n                \nhide caption Quitobaquito Springs, inside the Organ Pipe Cactus National Monument, is listed by the United Nations as an international biosphere reserve. A biologist peers into a rivulet that feeds this oasis in the middle of the Sonoran desert. \"These guys are very tiny, maybe half the size of a sesame seed. Those are the Quitobaquito tryonia. And there are literally thousands in here,\" says Jeff Sorensen, wildlife specialist supervisor with Arizona Game and Fish Department. He's an expert on this tiny snail, which is one of three species \u2014 along with a mud turtle and a pupfish \u2014 whose entire universe is this wetland. The springs have been used for 16,000 years by Native Americans, followed by Spanish explorers, traders and farmers. But the pond is a stone's throw from the international border, and the path of the wall. Conservationists fear workers will drill water wells to make concrete, and lower the water table which has been dropping for years. \"We do have concerns,\" Sorensen continues. \"Our species that are at this site rely on water just like everything else here in the desert southwest. And to take that water away from them means less of a home.\" The Trump administration is building 63 miles of wall in the Tucson Sector, to replace outdated pedestrian fences and vehicle barriers. CBP says this stretch of desert is a busy drug- and human-trafficking corridor. In 2019, the Tucson sector had 63,490 apprehensions and seized more than 61,900 pounds of illegal narcotics. The Defense Department is paying Southwest Valley Constructors, of Albuquerque, N.M., to erect 18- to 30-foot-tall, concrete-filled steel bollards, along with security lights and an all-weather patrol road. It will cost $10.3 million a mile. The rampart is going up in the Roosevelt Reservation, a 60-foot-wide strip of federal land that runs along the U.S. side of the border in New Mexico, Arizona and California. It was established in 1907 by President Theodore Roosevelt. Congress refused to authorize money for construction of the wall in Arizona. Under Trump's national emergency declaration, the Defense Department has reprogrammed counterdrug funding to build the border wall. In responses to questions from NPR, CBP says contractors will not drill for water within five miles of Quitobaquito Springs. The agency says it is coordinating with the National Park Service, Fish & Wildlife and other stakeholders to identify sensitive areas \"to develop avoidance or mitigation measures to eliminate or reduce impacts to the environment.\" Additionally, CBP is preparing an Environmental Stewardship Plan for the construction project. Critics are not appeased. \"There is a whole new level of recklessness we're seeing under Trump. We thought Bush was bad, but this is a whole other order of magnitude,\" says Laiken Jordahl, a former national park ranger and now borderlands campaigner with the Center for Biological Diversity. There was an outcry, too, back in the late 2000s when President George W. Bush built the first generation of bollard wall. Those barriers topped out at 18 feet. The structures rising southwest of Tucson are as tall as a two-story building. They look like they could hold back a herd of T-rexes. A 30-foot border barrier \u2014 as tall as a two-story building \u2014 rises from the desert near Lukeville, Ariz.\n                \n                    \n                    Laiken Jordahl /Center for Biological Diversity\n                    \n                \nhide caption A 30-foot border barrier \u2014 as tall as a two-story building \u2014 rises from the desert near Lukeville, Ariz. The Trump administration is using the same Real ID Act of 2005 that empowered President George W. Bush to build his border wall without heeding environmental protections. But the pace of waivers is quickening under Trump's aggressive construction timeline. Under Bush, the Department of Homeland Security issued five waiver proclamations. Under Trump, DHS has issued 15 waivers that exempt the contractors from a total of 51 different laws, ranging from the Clean Water Act to the Archeological Resources Protection Act to the Wild Horse and Burro Act. \"The waivers allow them to bypass a lot of red tape and waive the public input process,\" says Kenneth Madsen, a geography professor at Ohio State University at Newark who monitors border wall waivers. \"It allows them to avoid getting bogged down in court cases that might slow down their ability to construct border barriers along the nation's edges.\" The most important law that CBP is able to sidestep is the National Environmental Policy Act, NEPA\u2014known as the Magna Carta of federal environmental laws. It requires a detailed environmental assessment of any \"federal actions significantly affecting the quality of the human environment.\" NEPA covers most large federal construction projects, such as dams, bridges, highways, and waterway projects. Considering the construction of 450 miles of steel barriers on the nation's southern boundary, \"There is no question that NEPA would require preparation of an environmental impact statement, with significant input from the public, from affected communities, tribal governments, land owners, and land managers throughout the process. And it is outrageous that a project of this magnitude is getting a complete exemption from NEPA and all the other laws,\" says Dinah Bear.

To some border residents, barriers \u2014 regardless how controversial \u2014 are the best way to stop illegal activity. \"I support Donald Trump 100%. If you're going to build a wall, build it!\" declares rancher John Ladd. His family has bred cattle in Arizona since it was a territory. Their ranch backs up to the Mexican border near the town of Naco. The surrounding mountains purple at dusk, as a bull and his harem of cows munch gramma grass. Time was when the Ladd ranch was overrun by people crossing the border illegally. They stole things and cut fences and left trash in the pastures. Then in 2016, at the end of the Obama years, CBP built a fence, continuing what Bush started. Ladd reserves judgment on the propriety of a wall through a federally protected wilderness. But for his ranch, walls worked. \"When this 18-foot wall went in, it was obvious that immigrants quit coming through here,\" he says. \"It was an immediate improvement with the security of our border as well as our houses.\" Other border neighbors feel differently. The vast Tohono O'odham Nation \u2014 nearly as big as Connecticut \u2014 shares 62 miles with Mexico. The tribe vehemently opposes the border wall. Several thousand tribal members live south of the border, and are permitted to pass back and forth using tribal IDs. Already, border barriers are encroaching on the reservation from the east and west. While there is currently no funding to wall off the Arizona Tohono O'odham lands from Mexico, tribal members fear CBP could change its mind at any time. \"We have lived in this area forever,\" says Tribal Chairman Ned Norris, Jr. \"And so a full-blown 30-foot wall would make it that much difficult for our tribal citizens in Mexico and in the U.S. to be able to actively participate with family gatherings, with ceremonial gatherings.\" The Antone family, (left to right) Genae, Brice and Tim, tribal members of the Tohono O'odham Nation, on a pilgrimage for St. Francis.\n                \n                    \n                    John Burnett/NPR\n                    \n                \nhide caption The Antone family, (left to right) Genae, Brice and Tim, tribal members of the Tohono O'odham Nation, on a pilgrimage for St. Francis.

            "article_content": "President Trump's border wall is going up between Arizona and Mexico, and it's generating controversy because of its proximity to the Organ Pipe Cactus National Monument and Native Americans lands.  DAVID GREENE, HOST: In Arizona, a border wall is now going up between the United States and Mexico, and conservationists are furious. President Trump's wall will skirt one of the most beloved areas in the Southwest, the Organ Pipe Cactus National Monument. It has been recognized by the United Nations as an international biosphere reserve. What's more - Native Americans who live along the border say the wall will disrupt their traditions. Here's NPR's John Burnett. JOHN BURNETT, BYLINE: On a recent drive along Arizona's southern border, I watched a crew transplanting saguaro cactus out of the zone with they're about to build the wall. This is from an Army Corps of Engineers video. (SOUNDBITE OF VIDEO) UNIDENTIFIED PERSON: There may be misconceptions that we are on a construction site and just not caring for the environment, just proceeding with work as planned. We are relocating saguaro, organ pipe, ocotillo... BURNETT: But a half-mile away, I drove up on a big yellow bulldozer scraping the desert clean and mowing down cactus columns that are likely older than the young man operating the dozer. Customs and Border Protection later said they don't save unhealthy plants like these. This scene illustrates why environmentalists are deeply skeptical of the government's plans. They fear that Customs and Border Protection and the Department of Defense, as they race to meet the president's deadline of 450 miles of wall by the elections in 2020, will plow through one of the most biologically and culturally rich regions of the continental United States. The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service has warned that the wall could negatively impact 23 endangered and at-risk species, including the Sonoran pronghorn antelope, and the National Park Service says construction could destroy 22 archeological sites. Yet for this stretch of western desert, the government has waived 41 federal environmental laws to expedite construction. KEVIN DAHL: This is a wall to fulfill a campaign promise. It's really clear. And that's what makes many of us so angry that's being done so fast outside the rule of law. And we know that it'll have incredible impacts. BURNETT: Kevin Dahl is the Arizona representative for the National Parks Conservation Association, a nonprofit. We're sitting beside a serene spring-fed pond fringed by cat tails and dive-bombed by dragonflies. It's called Quitobaquito Springs inside the organ pipe cactus refuge. A biologist peers into a rivulet that feeds this oasis in the middle of the Sonoran Desert. JEFF SORENSEN: These guys are very tiny, maybe half the size of a sesame seed. Those are the Quitobaquito tryonia. And there are literally thousands in here. BURNETT: Jeff Sorensen is with Arizona Game & Fish. He's an expert on this tiny snail. It's one of three species, along with a mud turtle and a pupfish, whose entire universe is this wetland. But the pond is a stone's throw from the international border and the path of the wall. Conservationists fear that workers will drill water wells to make concrete and lower the water table, which has been dropping for years. SORENSEN: We do have concerns. Our species that are at this site rely on water, just like everything else here in this desert Southwest. And to take that water away from them means less of a home. BURNETT: The Trump administration is building 63 miles of wall on the Arizona border to replace rundown pedestrian fences and vehicle barriers. CBP says this stretch of desert is a busy drug and human trafficking corridor. It's erecting new 18 to 30-foot-tall concrete-filled steel bollards, along with security lights and an all-weather patrol road. It'll cost more than $10 million a mile. In responses to questions from NPR, the agency says contractors will not drill for water within five miles of Quitobaquito Springs. The agency says it is in regular contact with federal environmental officials, and it is doing its utmost to reduce impacts to the natural world. Critics are not appeased. LAIKEN JORDAHL: There is a whole new level of recklessness that we are seeing under Trump. I mean, we thought Bush was bad, but this is a whole nother order of magnitude. BURNETT: Laiken Jordahl is an anti-war activist with the Center for Biological Diversity. There was an outcry, too, back in the late 2000s when President George W. Bush built the first generation of bollard wall. Those barriers topped out at 18 feet. The massive structure rising southwest of Tucson is nearly twice as tall. It looks like it could hold back a herd of T. Rex's. JOHN LADD: I support Donald Trump 100%. If you're going to build a wall, build it. BURNETT: John Ladd's family has bred cattle in Arizona since it was a territory. Their ranch backs up to the Mexican border. The surrounding mountains purple at dusk, as a bull scratches his haunches on a yucca. Time was when the Ladd ranch was overrun by unauthorized crossers. They stole things and cut fences. Then in 2016, at the end of the Obama years, CBP built a fence continuing what Bush started. John Ladd reserves judgment on a wall through a federally protected wilderness. But for his ranch, walls worked. LADD: When this 18-foot wall went in, it was obvious that immigrants quit coming through here. It was an immediate improvement with the security of our border as well as our houses. BURNETT: Other border neighbors feel differently. The vast Tohono O'odham Nation shares 62 miles with Mexico. They vehemently oppose the border wall. Several thousand tribal members live south of the border, and they can pass back and forth without passports. Already, the barriers are encroaching on tribal lands from both sides. While there is currently no funding to wall off the reservation from Mexico, tribal members fear that CBP could change its mind. Tribal chairman Ned Norris Jr. NED NORRIS JR: We have lived in this area forever, and so a full blown out 30-foot wall would make it that much more difficult for our tribal citizens in Mexico and in the U.S. to be able to actively participate with family gatherings, with ceremonial gatherings. BURNETT: Traditions are important to the Antone family. I met them recently walking westward along the state highway that runs through the reservation. They were on a pilgrimage for St. Francis. Eighteen-year-old Genae Antone (ph) talked about another rite of passage that's vital to young Tohono O'odham men. They travel on foot, the round trip of 300 miles, from the reservation across the border to the salt flats at Mexico's Sea of Cortez. GENAE ANTONE: The salt run for the men, that's really important for us as Tohono O\u2019odham, you know, for the men to go run and run all the way to the water to get salt. Some people go and get seashells. So I don't really necessarily think it's a good idea. BURNETT: The Antone family, carrying a feathered walking stick, a statue of the Virgin and an American flag, then continue on their pilgrimage. John Burnett, NPR News, Tucson.

            "article_content": "NPR's Michel Martin speaks with Democratic presidential candidate Beto O'Rourke and two undecided voters in the candidate's hometown, El Paso, Texas.  MICHEL MARTIN, HOST: What would you ask a presidential candidate if you had the chance? We're giving some undecided voters across the country that chance as part of NPR's Off Script series. This past week, I flew to El Paso, Texas, to meet former congressman Beto O'Rourke and two local voters. O'Rourke picked the place - L&J Cafe, a favorite local spot where his family used to go for Tex-Mex when he was growing up and where he now takes his kids. BETO O'ROURKE: The green chili chicken enchiladas are absolutely amazing. You cannot go wrong if you order that. MARTIN: There was a lot to talk about besides the food. For example, what does O'Rourke have to say to those who fear an overcrowded Democratic field will end up hurting the party's chances next year? O'ROURKE: I say have no fear. We are many months from the Iowa caucus. And we both know the history of presidential primary polling and the candidates who were in the single digits at this time in their given presidential election pursuit. MARTIN: There was also a little time for some lighter questions, like what kind of hype music does O'Rourke like to play before a big rally? O'ROURKE: \"Baba O'Riley\" by The Who... (LAUGHTER) O'ROURKE: ...Off the album \"Who's Next\" - don't know if you've heard it. RUBEN SANDOVAL: I actually have it on vinyl. O'ROURKE: You do. SANDOVAL: Right on. Yeah - one of the best songs ever. MARTIN: Joining us at L&J Cafe were two Texas voters, both registered Democrats, who say they have not decided who they want as the party's nominee. Connie Martinez is a college student who will be getting to vote for president for the first time next year, and Ruben Sandoval, who teaches civics, political science and social studies in high school and community college in El Paso. They had lots of questions for O'Rourke on gun violence, immigration and many other issues. Here is one part of our conversation focusing on health care - which, for people in El Paso, also involves the border with Mexico, as Ruben explained. SANDOVAL: So many of us have to cross into Juarez, Mexico, in order to get our prescriptions at a lower cost because even though we have insurance, the cost is still too high. And so why is Americans who - we have to cross into Juarez, which, by the way, is a very dangerous city, and the traffic and the lines can be pretty horrendous. Why can't we get it through our own insurance? MARTIN: And I'm glad you raised that because everybody doesn't have the option of going to Juarez to get - however inconvenient to get cheaper prices. And, in fact, it isn't just prescription prices that are going up. We just have data this week saying that the premiums, even for people covered by private insurance, are at an all-time high. So the question is, what is your plan to bring down these out-of-pocket costs? O'ROURKE: I think we first need to look at why it's so expensive to purchase medication or to pay your premium or afford your copay or bridge your deductible right now. A lot of that has to do with the current administration undermining the Affordable Care Act and trying to remove protections, remove subsidies. We've seen extraordinary inflation over the last three years in all the cases that you describe. But specific to the pharmaceutical industry, this is a challenge that preexisted the Trump administration. Our Congress prevented Medicare by law from using its leverage and its purchasing power to drive down the cost to bargain for lower prescription medication costs. If we were to do that, not only would Medicare beneficiaries realize gains, but so would Medicaid, VA, Tricare and private insurance beneficiaries as well. So our proposal - allow Medicare to use its leverage to bargain for lower costs. Allow Americans to buy in Mexico or Canada or the European Union as long as we have the same level of quality and due diligence for the medications that are sold. If you can find them cheaper somewhere else, then you should be allowed by law to purchase them. MARTIN: Connie, do you want to get in this? Because I sure do. (LAUGHTER) CONNIE MARTINEZ: So I - like, since I am only 20, I'm still very dependent on my family. But I do agree with you, Ruben, where it's been very difficult for people of the working class, people who are educated to, you know, go to the doctor - something as simple - where, you know, even in my personal life, it's, like, oh, I can't go to the doctor for a while until, you know, money comes in because it does get so expensive. So I think it's really interesting about your... MARTIN: Can I just ask Connie a question? You're saying you can't go to the doctor. Why - because the co-pays are too high? MARTINEZ: The co-pays are too high. You know... MARTIN: So even though you have insurance... MARTINEZ: Yes. MARTIN: You still find yourself hesitating to go to the doctor... MARTINEZ: And there's... MARTIN: ...When you need to go because the out-of-pocket costs are still... MARTINEZ: Yes. MARTIN: ...Too high. MARTINEZ: The out-of-pocket cost is too high. The insurance doesn't cover enough where - you know, even though I don't know if you guys could tell, but I have braces, and there's times where it's a battle of, do I go to the doctor, or do I, you know, eat for the next week? And it's just very difficult because, you know, my family is educated. My mother's a teacher. My father works as well. And even though we're not in the low-income classes or anything, there's times where we're making sacrifices that shouldn't really be happening with everything that they've done for us. MARTIN: Well, thanks for letting me get in your business. MARTINEZ: No - no, you're fine. MARTIN: Because, Congressman, this is the question that has come up over and over again on the debate stage and that a lot of people are interested in. The people who say that they support single-payer - how do you bring the costs down? So the question is, how do you with your dual system get the objective that we're looking for here? O'ROURKE: Yeah. I like that you brought up costs because it's not an inexpensive proposition to guarantee everyone in this country health care - primary health care, prescription medication health care, mental health care - in a state whose largest provider of mental health care is the county jail system right now - reproductive health care so that every person can make their own decisions about their own body and have health care that allows them to do that. But far more expensive than doing that is the status quo. It costs us $110 to lock someone up who for their schizophrenia or bipolar disorder or clinical depression literally in Texas gets arrested on purpose. And this is not an uncommon thing. It's not right. It's immoral. It's unconscionable. But it's happening in this state. For a fraction of the cost, we could provide world-class outpatient mental health care either through an employer-sponsored health care plan or a Medicare for America plan that we've described where if you're uninsured or cannot afford your co-pays today, you can enroll in that program and not have to worry about a co-pay every time you go to the doctor or to the therapist or to a family planning provider. MARTIN: Tell me how the arithmetic works, though. Are you saying that bringing more people into your Medicare for America plan will do what? I mean, how does it increase the - how does it decrease the overall costs? Because it seems to me you still have two dual administrative systems - one for private insurance and one for the publicly funded option that you're talking about. So how does that bring costs down overall? O'ROURKE: When tens of millions of Americans are now able to go to a doctor and don't receive their care on an emergency basis in the ER, when those with mental health care challenges are able to see a therapist or a psychologist or a psychiatrist instead of getting arrested on purpose, we as taxpayers save in the billions of dollars when you look at this over the next 10 to 20 years. You're right. Private insurance has a higher administrative cost - something like 16% compared to Medicare's 2%. We envision that most of the millions of our fellow Americans who are uninsured today will enroll in Medicare. And that's a saving over private insurance. But I also want to make sure that I'm listening to our fellow Americans, tens of millions of them. Many of the members of unions who fought for health care plans that they like, that work for them and their families - if they want to keep them, I want them to be able to make the choice to be able to do that. And yes, over the long term, this country saves. This country produces better health care outcomes. MARTIN: OK. But some of your fellow Democratic candidates have identified specific funding streams. They say there's - particularly Elizabeth Warren. She said specifically, a tax on the highest earners. You're not prepared to identify... O'ROURKE: Yes. MARTIN: ...A specific funding source for this. O'ROURKE: Sure I am. If we took a corporate tax rate that under the $2 trillion Trump tax cuts, the benefits of which flowed to corporations, flowed to the very wealthiest in this country - if we took that corporate tax rate that had dropped from 35 to 21% back up just to 28%, we would generate hundreds of billions of dollars over the next 10 years. If we were to tax returns on capital at the same rate that we tax ordinary wage income, the income that is being earned by our server here at L&J, we would generate hundreds of billions of dollars. And yes, if we were to add a transactions tax on Wall Street transactions, a wealth tax to address the fact that you have the greatest divide in wealth inequality in this country's history right now in 2019, not only would we generate the revenue to be able to pay for these programs - we would also address something that is a threat to our democracy and a threat to everyone in this country - being able to see a future for themselves and their kids in this country. So yes, we can pay for this. And those are the streams that we would look at. MARTIN: That was Beto O'Rourke, former congressman from Texas running for the Democratic nomination for president speaking with me and undecided voters Connie Martinez and Ruben Sandoval at L&J Cafe in El Paso, Texas. We'll have much more from this conversation this week across NPR programs.

            "article_content": "Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and his wife, Sara, cast their votes at a voting station in Jerusalem on Tuesday.\n                \n                    \n                    Heidi Levine/AP\n                    \n                \nhide caption Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and his wife, Sara, cast their votes at a voting station in Jerusalem on Tuesday. Updated at 9:04 p.m. ET The polls are closed in Israel and partial results will not be released until early Wednesday morning. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and his Likud party faced voters for the second time in just five months in an unprecedented contest that has the potential to end his decade-long grip on power. Opinion polls ahead of Tuesday's vote showed the race between Netanyahu's Likud and the Blue and White, led by former army chief Benjamin \"Benny\" Gantz, were once again a dead heat. In post-election remarks, neither Netanyahu nor Gantz declared victory. As he fought to stay in office, Netanyahu repeatedly broke election laws by making live media appearances during Tuesday's vote, according to the Haaretz newspaper. Blue and White party leader Benny Gantz and his wife, Revital, leave a polling station in Rosh Haayin, Israel, on Tuesday.\n                \n                    \n                    Sebastian Scheiner/AP\n                    \n                \nhide caption Blue and White party leader Benny Gantz and his wife, Revital, leave a polling station in Rosh Haayin, Israel, on Tuesday. Netanyahu and his wife, Sara, cast their own votes at the Gimmel Jerusalem Municipal High School Tuesday. Afterward, the prime minister urged his supporters to vote, using live video streams on his Facebook page to say his party needs to unite to close a gap that might allow what he called a leftist, pro-Arab government to take power. Voting began at 7 a.m. local time (midnight ET) at more than 11,000 polling stations. A total of 31 parties were contesting the elections, though only about 10 were seen as likely to reach the threshold to win seats in the Knesset, Israel's parliament. In Tel Aviv, voter Avi Yehudai \u2014 who supports Gantz \u2014 told NPR's Daniel Estrin that he's not optimistic about the outcome. \"I wanted Gantz, but I am very pessimistic,\" Yehudai says. \"I think we will be remaining in the same situation as we are now.\" Months of political limbo followed Israel's election in April, when both Likud and the centrist Blue and White party won 35 seats in the 120-seat Knesset. I had a call today with Prime Minister Netanyahu to discuss the possibility of moving forward with a Mutual Defense Treaty, between the United States and Israel, that would further anchor the tremendous alliance.... After that race, Netanyahu engaged in an ultimately futile scramble to secure enough allies among smaller parties to form a governing coalition. Rather than allow Blue and White an opportunity to form a government, he called for new elections. When it comes to security issues, the political differences between Likud and Blue and White are narrow, with both sides taking a similarly hard line on the regional struggle against Iran and relations with the Palestinians. If he wins, Netanyahu has pledged to annex the Jordan Valley in the West Bank, where Palestinians are seeking a separate state. Meanwhile, Blue and White says it wants to strengthen Jewish settlement in the West Bank and calls the Jordan Valley Israel's \"eastern security border.\" The parties do differ on domestic issues, particularly whether to include ultra-Orthodox religious parties in a governing coalition. Gantz rules it out, leading to speculation he may form a secular coalition with Likud \u2014 but without Netanyahu. Netanyahu has sought to use his close relationship with President Trump to political advantage and some versions of campaign posters feature a photograph of Netanyahu and Trump shaking hands and grinning. Just days ago, Trump also dangled the possibility of a U.S.-Israel mutual defense treaty \u2014 a move that seemed timed for the election \u2014 tweeting that he and Netanyahu could move forward with a treaty to \"further anchor the tremendous alliance between our two countries.\" Netanyahu, Israel's longest-serving prime minister, has been dogged by multiple corruption cases alleging fraud, bribery and breach of trust. It is widely believed that if he manages to win a working majority, Netanyahu will use it to pass a law granting him immunity for crimes committed in office. The prime minister himself has repeatedly denied such a plan, labeling it as \"false media spin.\" In an appeal to voters, Netanyahu, writing in the Maariv newspaper on Monday, said Israelis find themselves \"at the high point of an historic change in the history of the Jewish people and the State of Israel.\" \"I am asking now for your confidence in order to complete the historic task and fortify the State of Israel's borders and security forever,\" he said.",

Here are those questions and how they got answered: There weren't tremendous fireworks between the two. Former Vice President Joe Biden signaled that he'd be ready to go after Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren, and he took a couple of shots at her, especially on health care. \"The senator says she's with Bernie,\" Biden said, referring to Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders' Medicare for All plan, which would replace private health insurance. \"I'm with Barack.\" The health care focus was more on Sanders, which allowed Warren to skate unscathed. And that was largely the case for most of the debate. It's safe to say if Biden and Warren continue on the current course, they won't be able to avoid each other so easily in the near future. Well, yes. This was Biden's best debate of this campaign. At the outset he was the crispest he has been. Biden started to slip some in the last hour, but his campaign has to hope that fewer people were watching, and the highlights had already occurred. What helped him was that the debate didn't turn into a pile-on of Biden again because Sen. Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota decided to hug the moderate lane, seeing an opening to do so. Remember, on health care, the July NPR/PBS NewsHour/Marist poll found Medicare for All as a replacement to the current health care system was unpopular. As an option, however, it was far more popular. And that led to perhaps a surprising split onstage with Biden, Klobuchar and South Bend, Ind. Mayor Pete Buttigieg on one side (against Medicare for All as a replacement) versus Sanders and Warren, and it was mostly Sanders doing the defending. After all, he \"wrote the damn bill,\" which he reminded the audience again. Not so much. Many candidates were more careful than in prior debates not to go along with positions popular with the progressive base but unpopular with the general electorate. They were also much more gushing about the tenure of former President Barack Obama. They have up to this point largely ceded the pro-Obama turf to Biden, who has been leading in the polls, a reminder of how beloved the former president is within the party. Here were the most unpopular candidate positions in the NPR/PBS NewsHour/Marist poll from July and what happened with them in the debate Thursday night: A universal basic income of $1,000 a month to stave off the effects of automation \u2014 27% good idea, 66% bad idea This is an idea exclusive to entrepreneur Andrew Yang. When Yang offered to hold a competition to give money to 10 contestants, there was a dismissive laugh from California Sen. Kamala Harris and a side-eyed dismissal from Buttigieg. Providing reparations for slavery \u2014 27%/62% Former Texas Rep. Beto O'Rourke forcefully said he was in favor of reparations, but his was the only mention of it in the debate. Previously, other candidates have essentially side-stepped the issue, mostly saying they're in favor of commissions to study the subject. Decriminalizing illegal border crossings \u2014 27%/66% This was a flashpoint between former Secretary of Housing and Urban Development Juli\u00e1n Castro and O'Rourke in a previous debate, but it did not come up Thursday night. Castro touted that he would get a comprehensive immigration overhaul bill done in his first 100 days, and Warren noted that she wanted a \"path to citizenship that is fair and achievable.\" That position is much more popular \u2013 64% said it was a good idea to provide a path to citizenship for people in the U.S. illegally. Health insurance for immigrants in the U.S. illegally \u2014 33%/62% This was another flashpoint in an earlier debate, but not Thursday. Instead, mentioned more often were Dreamers, people who were brought to the U.S. illegally as children. Giving them citizenship is a far more popular policy issue than health insurance for those in the country illegally. Warren and O'Rourke did argue for Dreamers' relatives to also get citizenship, but it's not clear whether that's popular with voters. Abolishing the death penalty \u2014 36%/58% This didn't come up Thursday night. Criminal justice reform, yes, something President Trump has pursued. The death penalty \u2013 no. Medicare for All as a replacement to the current health care system \u2014 41%/54% This was the major subject of the night. Nothing creates a debate within the Democratic Party quite like health care. That's because it routinely ranks as the top issue for Democrats, and their candidates have given it quite a bit of thought over the years. If the individual mandate was the health care debate point of the 2008 campaign between Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton, Medicare for All is this year's. And, as noted earlier, Sanders and Warren were left on their own to defend it, mostly from Biden, Klobuchar and Buttigieg. By the way, Medicare for All as an option, rather than replacement, is far more popular \u2013 70% of Americans think it's a good idea. What about guns? Klobuchar noted that everyone on the stage is in favor of an assault-style weapons ban. That is a remarkable thing considering just how controversial it is in public debate, but the latest NPR/PBS NewsHour/Marist poll found a ban fairly popular overall \u2013 57% want Congress to pass it (but only a small minority of Republicans). Sanders, Biden and Warren raise their hands during the debate.\n                \n                    \n                    Win McNamee/Getty Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption Yes. Sanders and Warren did not go after each other, but notably Sanders was under fire from Biden and others, who used his professed democratic socialism as a foil to paint Sanders and his policies as extreme. That allowed Warren to use Sanders as something of a heat shield. Sanders seemed irked by it all. One wonders whether the detente shall hold if Warren's numbers continue to rise and surpass Sanders. If prior debates saw candidates cautious in the kinds of chances they would take, Thursday night saw lower-polling candidates take more risks and throw more Hail Marys. Yang tried his competition stunt. Klobuchar went for broke in the moderate lane. O'Rourke, who was in full reboot mode of his candidacy, said he is in favor of reparations for African Americans as recompense for slavery, called Trump a \"white supremacist\" and added, \"Hell yes,\" when asked whether he is going to take away assault-style weapons as president. Castro forcefully went after Biden and took a big risk, accusing him of \"forgetting\" what he said earlier (four different times) \u2014 something that, to many, looked and sounded like an assault on the 76-year-old Biden's mental acuity. Castro argued after the debate that he was right on the merits, but the approach left a sour taste for many who saw it. New Jersey Sen. Cory Booker said flatly that Trump is a \"racist\" and called for an office in the White House to deal with the problem of white supremacy and hate crimes. So will any of that work? For what it's worth, Klobuchar and Booker seemed to deliver good performances, and O'Rourke made a mark, standing out more than in the first two debates. There doesn't, however, seem to be much evidence from Thursday night's debate to suggest that the shape of the race for the Democratic presidential nomination was altered in any fundamental fashion.",

Cory Booker, D-N.J., former Vice President Joe Biden, and Sen. Kamala Harris, D-Calif., onstage before the July debate. There are now less than five months to go before the first votes are cast in the Democratic presidential nominating contest. So the spotlight is going to be even hotter on the 10 candidates who made the cut for Thursday's debate in Houston. (Follow NPR's live analysis here.) Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren is ascendant with more Democrats saying they like her than any other candidate, but former Vice President Joe Biden continues to lead in the polls. So what might set them apart, what could be the flashpoints Thursday night, and can any of the other candidates break through? Here are some key logistical questions, followed by political ones: When is the debate? Thursday from 8-11 p.m. ET What channel is it on? ABC and Univision (with Spanish translation) Who are the moderators? ABC's George Stephanopoulos, David Muir, Linsey Davis and Univision's Jorge Ramos Who's on the stage? Biden, Sens. Cory Booker of New Jersey, Kamala Harris of California, Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota, Bernie Sanders of Vermont and Warren, as well as South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg, Obama Housing Secretary Juli\u00e1n Castro, former Rep. Beto O'Rourke of Texas and tech investor Andrew Yang. What were the qualifications to get into this debate? 2% in at least four Democratic polls, either nationally or in early states, as well as 130,000 donors from at least 20 states and at least 400 in each state. 1. What will the Biden-Warren dynamic be like? Democratic presidential candidate Sen. Elizabeth Warren shakes hands with supporters after speaking at the New Hampshire Democratic Party Convention in Manchester, N.H., last week.\n                \n                    \n                    Scott Eisen/Getty Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption Democratic presidential candidate Sen. Elizabeth Warren shakes hands with supporters after speaking at the New Hampshire Democratic Party Convention in Manchester, N.H., last week. There's lots being made of the fact that this is the first time during this presidential campaign that Biden and Warren will share the debate stage. The question is whether they engage \u2014 and on what? They signaled that they might mix it up. Warren has gotten attention for her myriad plans, but a Biden adviser told CNN that the former vice president will likely argue in the debate that \"we need more than plans.\" One area ripe for debate is on bankruptcy law, an issue where they have a history. 2. Can Biden take the heat \u2014 again? Vice President Joe Biden and Sen. Kamala Harris, D-Calif., as seen on televisions in the press room during the Democratic primary debate in Detroit, Mich.\n                \n                    \n                    Jeff Kowalsky/AFP/Getty Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption Vice President Joe Biden and Sen. Kamala Harris, D-Calif., as seen on televisions in the press room during the Democratic primary debate in Detroit, Mich. In the first two debates, varying candidates have picked fights with Biden \u2014 Harris on busing, Booker on criminal justice, and so on. And he'll likely be the focus of criticism from other candidates because of his continued lead in the polls. But despite some missteps on the campaign trail and a lackluster first debate, his brand has shown resiliency. He not only leads the race nationally and in many state polls, but he's also extremely well liked among the Democratic base, something you'd likely never know if you only read Twitter, a point his campaign makes repeatedly. That makes him a target for the other candidates, who have to be wondering what it will take to dislodge him. Still, Democratic strategists see Biden as a fragile front-runner, and he has to have solid outings in these coming debates that will likely get more attention than the first couple of rounds. 3. Will the candidates double down on positions unpopular with general-election voters? A lot of the moderate Democratic candidates are not on the stage for this debate\u2014 Montana Gov. Steve Bullock, Colorado Sen. Michael Bennet and former Maryland Rep. John Delaney did not qualify, and former Colorado Gov. John Hickenlooper dropped out to run for the Senate. That means the progressives are likely to again target Biden and focus on issues unpopular outside of Democrats, like \"Medicare for All\" as a replacement to private insurance, health care for immigrants in the country illegally and decriminalizing border crossings. 4. Do Sanders and Warren maintain their nonaggression pact? Democratic presidential candidate Sen. Bernie Sanders speaks in front of the Colorado State Capitol earlier this week.\n                \n                    \n                    Michael Ciaglo/Getty Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption Democratic presidential candidate Sen. Bernie Sanders speaks in front of the Colorado State Capitol earlier this week. Warren is getting lots of attention and was not only the most popular candidate among Democrats in the latest NPR/PBS NewsHour/Marist poll, she's now caught up with \u2014 and even passed in some instances \u2014 fellow progressive Sanders in an average of the polls. That has to grate on Sanders, even if people close to him continue to say that he sees Warren as an ally for the kind of change he wants to see in the country. They have maintained that Sanders will not go after Warren unless they are the last two standing, but they also privately point out differences, such as on foreign policy and party politics. It's probably not the time yet for Sanders to need to go after Warren, but could some prickliness begin to emerge? Media no longer available Credit:  NPR 5. What kind of chances do candidates needing a breakout take? If a candidate hasn't had a moment yet, they now have a chance to do something to gain attention and create a spark for their campaign before a large audience. Yang, for one, is promising to do something no one's done. What exactly? No one knows, but Yang is hoping you tune in. Andrew Yang\u2019s campaign manager just called to tell me that at tomorrow night\u2019s debate, Yang will be doing \"something no presidential candidate has ever done before in history.\u201d He declined to go further than that. At the same time, it's not clear how many people will tune in. The latest NPR/PBS NewsHour/Marist poll found that more people said they weren't going to watch (42%) than said they would (38%).",

            "article_content": "Embattled British Prime Minister Boris Johnson is expected to push members of Parliament to grant him a snap election next month in order to break the Brexit deadlock.  DAVID GREENE, HOST: It is yet another big day in Brexit land. British Prime Minister Boris Johnson is in Dublin, Ireland, to talk about what could be the biggest consequence of a so-called hard Brexit, and that is what might happen on the Irish border. Johnson is also expected to push Parliament to hold a snap election. Let's talk all this through with NPR's Frank Langfitt in London. Hi there, Frank. FRANK LANGFITT, BYLINE: Hey. Good morning, David. GREENE: All right. Well, let's start with Ireland. I mean, this is kind of the nightmare Brexit scenario for some - that a hard border with Ireland could bring back old tensions. It could slow trade on what's now this seamless border. Is there a chance of some kind of breakthrough here? LANGFITT: I don't think today. That's not very likely. Johnson says he wants to get some kind of deal. But if you talk to people in Brussels, over at the European Union, they say nothing's been moving. And speaking with Johnson today, just ahead of their talks in Dublin, Irish Prime Minister Leo Varadkar, he made it very clear that negotiations have a long way to go. This is how he put it, David. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) PRIME MINISTER LEO VARADKAR: We must protect the peace and also the burgeoning all-island economy. We are open to alternatives, but they must be realistic ones - legally binding and workable. And we haven't received such proposals to date. LANGFITT: And, you know, David, the current solution is for the United Kingdom to stay in a close customs arrangement with the EU until they come up with something that's going to work to avoid these very things that you mentioned. Johnson, though, rejects that because it would keep the U.K tied to the EU potentially for many, many years. But as Varadkar just says, Johnson hasn't offered any solutions, and the time of course is ticking down. Still, here in the United Kingdom, it's scheduled to leave the European Union at the end of October. GREENE: All right, so one thing the prime minister is offering is his idea for Parliament to approve a snap election. But he would need votes in Parliament for that idea, right? LANGFITT: (Laughter) Yes, he would. GREENE: Does Johnson have them? LANGFITT: No, he doesn't at all. He needs a two-thirds majority, and he's going to - we think he's going to ask tonight for it. But the opposition parties are opposing him. Now, officially, they say we don't trust Boris Johnson. We think we're going to give him an election, and then he's going to trick us and crash the U.K. out of the EU anyway. Many, though, think the real reason behind this is the opposition Labour Party is trailing Johnson's Conservatives in the polls, and if there were an election next month, as Johnson wants, Labour would lose. And a big reason for this is, even as the Conservatives have basically had a disastrous time the last three years with Brexit, the Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn is even more unpopular than Johnson. And the reason for that is he is a socialist, and many people feel here that he would actually damage the U.K. economy. And so the problem that Labour has is the person at the top of their ticket is just not - he's very polarizing, and he's not that popular. GREENE: I always feel like, on moments like this, I'm making you, like, do a lightning round. I mean, there's so much to ask you about. LANGFITT: There is a lot, yeah. GREENE: We also have this other thing. Yes. The queen is expected to approve this new law today - right? - that would block the prime minister from taking the U.K. out of the EU at the end of October - that deadline that you mentioned - without some sort of agreement because the fear is that kind of withdrawal would damage the U.K. economy. Johnson says he might not abide by this law. So what is happening here? LANGFITT: (Laughter) He does. This was - in an exchange with a reporter on Friday, this is what the prime minister said. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) UNIDENTIFIED REPORTER: Can you make a promise today to the British public that you will not go back to Brussels and ask for another delay to Brexit? PRIME MINISTER BORIS JOHNSON: Yes. UNIDENTIFIED REPORTER: And - sorry? JOHNSON: I can. UNIDENTIFIED REPORTER: And would you rather... JOHNSON: I'd rather be dead in a ditch. GREENE: OK. (LAUGHTER) GREENE: That's pretty clear. LANGFITT: Yeah. GREENE: So how would Parliament respond if Johnson does defy them and ignore this law? LANGFITT: Well, I think they take him to court. We could see this all heading to the Supreme Court here in the United Kingdom sooner than later. GREENE: And then Johnson's supposed to suspend Parliament this week as well. LANGFITT: He is. It should be - could do as early as today, after he fails in - what's expected to fail in this vote. Or as late as Thursday, and then Parliament wouldn't come back until the middle of October. GREENE: Life in Brexit land, with NPR's Frank Langfitt. Frank, thank you as always for helping us understand this. LANGFITT: Happy to do it, David. Copyright \u00a9 2019 NPR.  All rights reserved.

Former Vice President Joe Biden continues to lead, as questions linger about his candidacy. Meanwhile, after a good summer, Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren is clearly on the rise, and Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders maintains his significant and loyal base of followers. California Sen. Kamala Harris saw a quick rise and then a receding after the second debate. And time is ticking for the rest of the candidates to stand out in the still crowded field.

The former vice president continues to lead in national and state polls, but Biden's missteps and lack of precision leaves questions about the long-term strength of his candidacy. But will his voters care? So far, Biden has maintained a lead by retaining support with older black voters, older voters in general, and he even leads among women. He has struggled mightily with voters under age 35; he's facing an enthusiasm gap; and he's got far from the majority of support within the party. He still has a long way to go before he could be seen as the likely nominee.

Warren benefited from two solid debate performances and will have another chance during the fall to present herself to a national audience looking for someone to take on Trump. The big question for her, though, is how she deals with the inevitable scrutiny that comes with a rise in the polls.

He hopes to get more time and media attention to help spread his message, because he badly needs to get better known.

But he's refusing to do that. Instead, after a mass shooting in his hometown of El Paso, O'Rourke rebooted his campaign to refocus on Donald Trump. Biden had been the sole candidate to make Trump his principal focus. The calculation, according to Democratic strategists, is if the Biden implosion happens, then O'Rourke would be there to pick up the pieces. But O'Rourke's not a former vice president, making this strategy something of a triple-bank shot.

Former Housing and Urban Development Secretary Juli\u00e1n Castro is now the 10th Democrat to qualify for next month's Democratic primary debate. Castro, a former mayor of San Antonio, Texas, who later became a part of President Obama's Cabinet, met the final benchmark on Tuesday after a CNN poll showed him at 2%, giving him the requisite four surveys where he hit that threshold. He had previously already attained the required 130,000 unique donors from 20 states. Loading... He will join former Vice President Joe Biden, New Jersey Sen. Cory Booker, South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg, California Sen. Kamala Harris, Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar, former Texas Rep. Beto O'Rourke, Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren and entrepreneur Andrew Yang in the debate in Houston, which will be moderated by ABC News and Univision. If one more candidate qualifies, the debate would have to stretch to two nights under DNC guidelines. It's scheduled for Sept. 12-13. Billionaire businessman and activist Tom Steyer has reached the donor threshold and is now only one poll away from qualifying. Hawaii Rep. Tulsi Gabbard has also qualified through fundraising, and she also registered 2% in the CNN poll released Tuesday, but she still needs two additional polls to make the cut. Candidates have until Aug. 28 to qualify. This week, author and spiritual leader Marianne Williamson and Washington Gov. Jay Inslee both announced they crossed 130,000 donors, but neither has yet registered 2% in any poll during the qualifying period. Castro is the only Latino candidate in the race and has made immigration a major issue, including his push to decriminalize illegal border crossings, which he heavily pushed in the first debate to have a major breakout moment \u2014 and a skirmish with fellow Texan O'Rourke. He told the NPR Politics Podcast that in order to curtail border crossings, he advocates boosting federal assistance to countries such as Guatemala, El Salvador and Honduras. \"I think that we're always going to have people coming from Central America and other parts of the world,\" he said. \"Do we need 140,000 people in one month coming from those countries? That's an indication that something is wrong in those countries, and I want to help heal that.\"",

Following two recent mass shootings, about half a dozen Democratic presidential candidates are not mincing their words when it comes to President Trump. They're calling him a \"white supremacist.\" \"He is,\" former Rep. Beto O'Rourke said on MSNBC. He had already called Trump a \"racist\" and was asked whether he thought Trump was a white supremacist. \"He is a dehumanizer. ... He has been very clear about who he prefers to be in this country and who he literally wants to keep out with walls and cages and militarization and torture and cruelty. And again, we in El Paso have born the brunt of all of that.\" Twenty-two people were killed in El Paso, Texas, earlier this month when a gunman opened fire in a Walmart. People from both sides of the U.S.-Mexico border were killed, and the shooter is believed to have written a screed deriding immigrants as invaders. The language in that manifesto is similar to the kind of language Trump has used, leading many to blame the president for using irresponsible rhetoric that could inspire people at the fringes. The progressive left has pressed candidates \u2014 and the media \u2014 to call Trump a \"liar\" and a \"racist.\" In fact, in a recent Quinnipiac poll, more than half of Americans said they believe the president is a racist \u2013 and the country has been bitterly divided, through partisan lenses, on race in this country. But calling the president an actual \"white supremacist\" is an escalation that has driven a wedge between some of the candidates. Vice President Joe Biden has said Trump has \"fanned the flames\" of white supremacy, and Sen. Kamala Harris of California said Trump \"empowers white supremacists\" and \"condones their behavior.\" For others, though, that doesn't go far enough. Count O'Rourke, Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont, Mayor Pete Buttigieg of Indiana, Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand of New York and entrepreneur Andrew Yang among those who have said the president is, in fact, a \"white supremacist.\" Not everyone, even some of those tasked with tracking hate groups, thinks that's responsible. \"I think it misses the point and overlooks the role that the president should be playing,\" said Oren Segal, director of Anti-Defamation League's Center on Extremism. But that doesn't mean Segal thinks the president has been responsible with his rhetoric. Segal points out that using terms like \"invasion\" when talking about immigrants and peddling conspiracies about caravans, are all in line with foundational ideologies of white supremacists. That's problematic and gives a degree of comfort to those groups, he said. \"Calling him a white supremacist based on those,\" Segal added, \"misses a larger point of what white supremacy is. They're calling for a white ethno state and are clear about their opposition to minorities. In some cases, many don't like Trump. Some are disappointed, for example, that he has a Jewish son-in-law and hasn't gone as far as they would have liked.\" He added, \"It's understandable to call out public officials, including the president of the United States, whose language seeks to mainstream the narratives that feed white supremacist ideas. It's completely acceptable to call out any public official when they are echoing those statements and ask them to tone it down, but going straight for this person as a white supremacist is a little too simple and, in fact, distracts from the calls for many of those public officials to use their positions to call out hatred and white supremacy by name.\" \"You know, you can't call someone a white supremacist and ask them to condemn it.\" Others disagree, most notably, the writer Ta-Nehisi Coates. Coates penned a piece in The Atlantic just months after Trump was inaugurated, titled, \"The First White President.\" He defended his stance on television. \"I think if you own a business that attempts to keep black people from renting from you,\" Coates said, \"... if your response to the first black president is that they weren't born in this country, despite all proof, if you say they weren't smart enough to go to Harvard Law School and then demand to see their grades, if that's the essence of your entire political identity, you might be a white supremacist.\" Akiba Solomon, co-author with Kenrya Rankin of How We Fight White Supremacy: A Field Guide to Black Resistance, notes, \"The president traffics in white-supremacist rhetoric and pushes polices that are white supremacist in impact. I don't know his heart or soul, I've never met him, but there is a pattern of white-supremacist decision making throughout his entire career.\" She adds that in her book, white supremacy is defined as \"a political, cultural and economic system premised on the subjugation of people who are not white.\" So, she said, \"according to that description, I would call the president a white supremacist.\" Trump defends himself and denounces white supremacy Trump condemned white supremacy in a speech from the White House last week after the El Paso shooting. \"The shooter in El Paso posted a manifesto online, consumed by racist hate,\" Trump said. \"In one voice, our nation must condemn racism, bigotry and white supremacy. These sinister ideologies must be defeated. Hate has no place in America.\" The Trump reelection campaign tweeted 14 examples of the president denouncing hate and racism, including white supremacy. The campaign declined to say whether it thought Democrats labeling the president a \"white supremacist\" was helping the president's campaign. \"For two years, Democrats called the President a Russian agent,\" Trump campaign communications director Tim Murtaugh said in a statement. \"Since that failed they've moved on to calling him a racist, white supremacist, mass murderer. It's false and absurd on its face, and Americans will see that Democrats are trying to divide Americans. They're also claiming that anyone who supports President Trump is racist. Calling half of the country racist is not a winning strategy and is not unifying.\" Trump himself told reporters he didn't think it helps him. \"I don't think it helps,\" he said. \"First of all, I don't like when they do it, because I am not any of those things. I think it's a disgrace, and I think it shows how desperate the Democrats are.\" Words that 'ring hollow' Heidi Beirich, director of the Intelligence Project at the Southern Poverty Law Center, said Trump's words, denouncing white supremacy, \"at best, ring hollow.\" \"I felt like they were the right words and definitely the wrong messenger,\" she said, \"because he's pushed out one white supremacist meme or talking point after another since he came down the escalator\" for his campaign kickoff announcement in 2015. She notes that the debate over the language Democratic presidential candidates are using misses a larger point. \"I think the problem here is that Trump seems to be using these nasty tactics as a way to rally the base,\" Beirich said, \"and it doesn't seem to matter what's in his heart. His mainstreaming them [white supremacists] and legitimizing them. That's the problem. And this stuff is blossoming. It's a dangerous game that Trump is playing.\" To Beirich's point about white supremacy's rise, the Anti-Defamation League has found that in just the first five months of 2019, there has been an increase in white supremacist recruitment, Segal said. He noted that white supremacists are pushing propaganda in public spaces, \"which speaks to a comfort level they have,\" he said. And hate-related murders connected to right-wing extremists, Segal said, are a \"consistent\" threat and have risen over the last decade. \"Many of the statements [Trump has made] are exactly what a white supremacist would say \u2014 whether talking about immigrants invading or African countries being 's***holes' or Mexicans are rapists,\" Beirich noted. \"He's tweeted out material that came from white supremacists, and a lot of his views are indirectly views from white nationalists. I don't know if that makes him a white nationalist, but he's talking from their scripts.\" And Beirich added, \"There is a link between this kind of rhetoric and violence.\" Segal agrees, but notes, \"Overall, we need to understand the impact of these narratives on the white supremacy movement, but without having to ascribe white supremacist intent on the president.\"",

After back-to-back mass shootings, residents in one Houston suburb are demanding members of Congress finally take action to stop a deadly trend in America. Fort Bend County is home to Sugar Land and other cities where demographics and political stripes are dramatically changing. And voters in the 22nd congressional district who have elected Republicans opposed to major gun restrictions in recent years may be considering giving a Democrat the job in 2020. It's pressure like this from these suburban communities in other parts of the country that could shift the debate on gun measures in Congress this fall. Criticism of gun lobby \"I don't think the NRA is doing its job that it was originally set out to do. They've become far too strident and Second Amendment \u2014 more guns, screw everybody else,\" said Fort Bend County resident Tom, a longtime NRA member who spoke to NPR but declined to give his last name out of fear for his family's safety. \"I don't think they are doing a good job representing us. I personally \u2014 this is really gonna get me in trouble \u2014 I personally don't have any need for the AR- and AK-style weapons.\" Tom, who made the comments from Fort Bend County gun range, thinks if high-capacity magazines behind mass shootings can't be banned, then it's time to ban assault-style weapons. Earlier this month, 22 were killed and more than 20 were injured at a Walmart in the border community of El Paso, Texas, by a suspected gunman from northeast Texas. The next day, nine were killed in a mass shooting that lasted less than one minute at a popular Dayton, Ohio, nightclub district. The incidents have led some Texas suburban residents who live in what was once a solidly GOP suburb to revisit their positions on the gun control. Fort Bend County is now one of the most diverse counties in the country. But it wasn't always that way. \"This is crazy\" When Kelly Fox first moved to Sugar Land in 1995, she was a pretty lonely Democrat in the area, which was much less ethnically diverse. By then, the last of the Texas Democratic giants, the late Gov. Ann Richards, was defeated by a rising political star from the Bush family \u2014 George W. Bush. And Republican Rep. Tom Delay, a powerful House GOP leader, represented Fox's district. \"My husband I always joke that we're like these little blue dots in a sea of red because Fort Bend County, well Texas, you know we were blue ... and things changed,\" Fox said during a recent visit to a nearby farmers' market. \"Fort Bend County in particular was very, very red.\" The county was largely white in the 1990s, but by 2010 it was considered the most ethnically diverse county in the state, according to Rice University's Kinder Institute for Urban Research. By 2016, Fort Bend had an ethnic breakdown of 35 percent Anglo, 24 percent Latino, 20 percent African-American and 21 percent Asian, according to an annual study by the institute. Fort Bend County is undergoing a new political metamorphosis thanks to its newfound ethnic diversity, and with that comes increasing interest in the Democratic party. And some say it's a symptom of a greater tide turning in Texas. Last month, Republican Rep. Pete Olson, the four-term congressman representing Fort Bend County and surrounding areas, said he was retiring. That news made the nonpartisan Cook Political Report shift the 22nd Congressional District into the \"toss up\" column in its ratings. Huge news for Dems: Rep. Pete Olson (R) to retire, moving #TX22 from Lean R to Toss Up at @CookPolitical. This is one of the fastest-diversifying districts in the country. Now that more Texas suburbs may be turning purple, or blue in some cases, some voters in suburban areas like Sugar Land think Democrats could have the answers in the wake of mass shootings like El Paso where 22 were left dead. Those voters say Democrats are more likely to push forward with plans to expand background checks for firearm purchases and add restrictions on assault-style weapons. \"They've really got to look at things that they can do as preventative measures without actually taking people's rights away. I don't want to take all guns away because that's not what most of us are pushing for when we talk about it,\" Fox said. \"It's more like this is crazy. There are things that we could do to make it a little more difficult for people of these mindsets \u2014 that are thinking these ways \u2014 to get their hands on these weapons that can kill people in a matter of seconds.\" Concerns about mental health At another Fort Bend County gun range, Air Force veteran Mike Smith says he's worried he could lose his gun. Smith was taking his 13-year-old daughter Mikenzie shooting for the first time after a break-in at his Richmond, Texas neighborhood. Smith, who works two blue-collar jobs, is for some gun restrictions. For example, he thinks the age limit should be raised for owners of assault-style weapons. And some should undergo a psychological profile. \"Do they need to raise the age limit on it? Yes. It needs to be raised to about 23, 24 and then if you're purchasing a weapon for your child, your child needs to go through the same thing that the parent goes through,\" Smith said. \"Basically let's give them a psychological exam. Not saying it's going to be 100 percent. But let's give it time to see if they're even capable of owning a weapon.\" After El Paso, Eileen Huang of Sugar Land worried her community could be targeted next. She attended a recent community meeting on gun violence for a nearby Democratic congressional district searching for answers. At the forum, Huang, who is president of the Sino Professional Association, which represents Asian American business workers, asked Houston Police Department leaders for help. Huang said she wants members of her community prepare to learn what to do next if they come face to face with a mass shooter. The suspected shooter in El Paso is accused of targeting the border community because for its large Latino population. \"If there is any training,\" Huang told two Houston Police Department officials in attendance, \"maybe you can host it for our community.\" Houston Police Department Assistant Chief Henry Gaw told those at the forum that those are the right questions to ask. \"We need everyone's eyes and ears involved,\" Gaw said. \"I hate to say this, but it's not a matter of 'if' it's going to happen, it's just a matter of 'when' and we just have to be very prepared to mitigate any casualties that might happen.\" \"We've got to do better by each other\" Rhonda Scott just moved from Ohio, the state where another recent mass shooting left nine dead, to the Stafford, Texas, area to be with her son. Stafford is also in the 22nd congressional district. Scott is not a fan of President Trump or what she described as his racially charged rhetoric. She wants to see lawmakers take real action on mass shooters, and stop the language that may be driving them to kill others. \"It's sad that the way we're going right now, you have to look over my shoulder,\" Scott said. \"You want to try and enjoy an events outdoor event, and it shouldn't have to be this way.\" Visiting a the farmers' market next to a bustling First Colony Mall, Fox says she's continuing to educate herself on the politics of her district and the issues that matter to her most, like gun control. Fox is also not a fan of Trump, and worries that his rhetoric has fueled a divisiveness and a rise in the language of hate. For example, she's proud that Fort Bend County Independent School District schools are designated \"No Place For Hate\" by the international Anti-Defamation League. \"I feel like government can work in a positive way in people's lives ... Maybe that's idealistic and naive, but I feel like that is the purpose of government,\" Fox said. \"So everything is happening now just kind of strengthens that feeling. It just makes me want to dig my heels in and say, 'You know, we've got to do better by each other. And for our country as a whole.'\"",

Guatemalans have chosen Alejandro Giammattei, a conservative who once led the country's prison system, to be their next president. Voter turnout in the runoff was low on Sunday in the small, Central American country. Preliminary results showed Giammattei won nearly 58% of the vote and that fewer than half of eligible Guatemalans had cast ballots, according to the country's electoral tribunal. A 63-year-old surgeon, Giammattei tried three times previously to become president before succeeding on his fourth attempt. He campaigned on a promise to fight crime and build \"a permanent political force with a deep love for God, family and Guatemala\" with his Vamos political party. When he takes office on Jan. 14, Giammattei will face a range of serious issues that include rampant corruption, widespread poverty and unemployment. He will also need to negotiate with President Trump, who last month threatened to impose a travel ban, tariffs on exports and taxes on migrants' remittances if Guatemala did not comply with his immigration ambitions. The Trump administration wants to reduce the numbers of migrants at the southern border by shifting the burden to Central American countries from which many migrants have fled. The administration expected Guatemala to become a safe third-party country \u2014 which would require migrants who travel through Guatemala to request asylum there instead of seeking protection in the United States. The deal was unpopular in Guatemala, and a high court blocked the country's president, Jimmy Morales, from signing the agreement last month. Morales blamed the court for harming his \"good relationship\" with Washington. Giammattei cast himself as ready for the job. \"I'm a man accustomed to working under pressure,\" he told NPR's Carrie Kahn on Sunday as he addressed reporters, moments after casting his ballot. Before he was declared the winner, Giammattei told Reuters he hoped to modify the migration deal with the United States. \"I hope that during this transition the doors will open to get more information so we can see what, from a diplomatic point of view, we can do to remove from this deal the things that are not right for us, or how we can come to an agreement with the United States,\" he said. \"If we don't have the capacity to look after our own people, imagine what it will be like for foreigners,\" Giammattei added. About 250,000 people from Guatemala were apprehended at the border since October, according to to U.S. Customs and Border Protection. They were fleeing extreme violence, poverty and food insecurity. Giammattei defeated Sandra Torres, a former first lady who would have become Guatemala's first female president. Both candidates have faced allegations of corruption and criminal acts. Former military officers who were accused of war crimes joined Giammattei's political party, The Associated Press reported. In 2010, Giammattei was arrested for his involvement in extrajudicial killings when he led the country's prison system, according to a United Nations-backed group called the International Commission Against Impunity in Guatemala. The case against him was eventually dismissed. He announced in the spring that he was taking legal action against the organization, which had steadily earned the trust of Guatemalans by investigating military and government elites for stealing public funds. Last year, Morales announced that he would not renew the commission's mandate, which expires next month \u2014 essentially shutting down the anti-graft group. The commission submitted hundreds of convictions to the Guatemalan Congress. Morales, a former comedian, was entangled in an investigation for allegedly accepting illegal campaign contributions. And two former Guatemalan presidents, among others, were jailed on corruption charges. \"Guatemala is so bad,\" said Paula Rosales, who was selling trinkets outside the main downtown cathedral in Guatemala City. Rosales told Kahn that the last president let migrants in, stole from the people and did nothing to help the poor. Jessica Viviral, a 23-year-old university student who voted for the first time on Sunday, expressed uncertainty about what comes next with Giammattei at the country's helm. \"Really the future is in his hands and we don't know exactly what he's going to do,\" she said. \"That's really scary.\" Juan Carlos Tefel, president of Guatemala's leading business group, told NPR that many Guatemalans \"are very disenchanted with the process.\" He said Guatemala must improve its diplomatic relations with the United States. \"We have a lot to lose if our relationship with the United States goes south.\"",

Will Hurd, R-Texas, announced Thursday he won't run for reelection in 2020 after only narrowly surviving last fall in a district that voted for Hillary Clinton.\n                \n                    \n                    Eric Gay/AP\n                    \n                \nhide caption Rep. Will Hurd, R-Texas, announced Thursday he won't run for reelection in 2020 after only narrowly surviving last fall in a district that voted for Hillary Clinton. Texas Rep. Will Hurd, the lone black Republican in the House, announced Thursday evening he won't run for reelection in 2020. Hurd's surprise decision is not only a setback for a party in need of diversity but also means there will be one less rare member of the GOP caucus who is willing to speak out against President Trump. The 41-year-old's exit makes it tougher for Republicans to hold on to his swing district next year and is also an ominous sign for his party's chances of winning back the House as retirements continue to mount. I have made the decision to not seek reelection for the 23rd Congressional District of Texas in order to pursue opportunities outside the halls of Congress to solve problems at the nexus between technology and national security. https://t.co/GeZ4Hh264f \"I left a job I loved in the CIA as an undercover officer to meet what I believed to be a need for new leadership in Congress on intelligence and national security matters,\" Hurd said in a statement. \"I wanted to help the Intelligence Community in a different way by bringing my knowledge and experience to Congress. I'm leaving the House of Representatives to help our country in a different way. I want to use my knowledge and experience to focus on these generational challenges in new ways. It was never my intention to stay in Congress forever, but I will stay involved in politics to grow a Republican Party that looks like America.\" First elected to Congress in 2014, Hurd represents a perpetual swing district that is one of the largest in the country, stretching from San Antonio to just outside El Paso and taking in over 800 miles of the Southern border. Hurd is also the last Republican to represent a district along the U.S.-Mexico border. But Hurd has opposed Trump's push for a border wall, saying that \"building a 30-foot-wall from sea to shining sea is the most expensive and least efficient way to do border security.\" Hurd also pushed for a permanent fix for the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program. Hurd has taken vocal stances against Trump in other instances, too. Last year in a New York Times op-ed, Hurd \u2014 who had been an undercover CIA officer for almost 10 years before being elected to Congress \u2014 asserted that Trump was being manipulated by Russian President Vladimir Putin. \"The president's failure to defend the United States intelligence community's unanimous conclusions of Russian meddling in the 2016 election and condemn Russian covert counterinfluence campaigns and his standing idle on the world stage while a Russian dictator spouted lies confused many but should concern all Americans,\" Hurd wrote. \"By playing into Vladimir Putin's hands, the leader of the free world actively participated in a Russian disinformation campaign that legitimized Russian denial and weakened the credibility of the United States to both our friends and foes abroad.\" Hurd was also one of just four House Republicans who voted for a resolution to condemn Trump's racist tweets last month attacking four freshman Democratic women of color. His positions and willingness to speak out against Trump made sense, given the political and demographic makeup of his district. The 23rd District is almost 70% Latino, and Hillary Clinton won it by about 3.5 percentage points in 2016. Last year's midterm elections left Hurd as one of just three House Republicans to sit in a district carried by Clinton, not Trump. But Hurd only barely survived in 2018 to win reelection by just 926 votes over Democrat Gina Ortiz Jones, an Air Force veteran who had already announced she was seeking a rematch in 2020. Without Hurd, who was seen by Republicans and Democrats alike as an unusually strong GOP incumbent, the Cook Political Report has moved its rating for this seat from Toss Up to Lean Democratic. Hurd's shocking decision also makes him the ninth Republican so far this cycle \u2014 and sixth in just over the past week \u2014  to announce retirement, a number that is expected to grow especially as members head home for August recess. It's far from surprising to see retirements increase for the minority party in the aftermath of losing the House. But the already high number coupled with decisions from some surprising lawmakers in addition to Hurd \u2014 such as Indiana Rep. Susan Brooks, who also serves as the National Republican Congressional Committee's 2020 recruitment chair \u2014 signals that many within the GOP caucus also very likely doubt Republicans can win back the House next November, where they need either 18 or 19 seats, depending on the outcome of a re-do election in North Carolina next month.",

Protesters disrupted the debate to criticize his handling of the officer involved in Eric Garner's death.\n                \n                    \n                    Scott Olson/Getty Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio speaks during the Democratic presidential debate in Detroit on Wednesday. Protesters disrupted the debate to criticize his handling of the officer involved in Eric Garner's death. Wednesday's Democratic presidential primary debate in Detroit was interrupted twice by protesters in the audience who were trying to draw attention to immigration and policing issues. The first happened only minutes into the debate, which was broadcast live on CNN. During New Jersey Sen. Cory Booker's opening statement, a few audience members began yelling, \"Fire Pantaleo.\" The chant was a reference to Staten Island, N.Y., police officer Daniel Pantaleo, who was involved in the 2014 death of Eric Garner. Garner, who was black, died after being placed in a chokehold by Pantaleo, who is white. Police had approached Garner suspecting he was illegally selling cigarettes. Video of the incident, which captured Garner saying \"I can't breathe,\" became another rallying point in the ongoing tensions between the African American community and law enforcement. It appears the protest burst was actually aimed at New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio, who has been criticized for not pushing for Pantaleo's dismissal, particularly after the Justice Department declined to bring criminal charges against Pantaleo on July 16. De Blasio does not legally have the power to fire Pantaleo, The New York Times reports. But his handling of the issue has contributed to his low approval ratings from his constituents. Other city leaders say de Blasio \u2014 who often talks about race issues through the lens of having a biracial son and who touted halting \"stop and frisk\" during his own opening statement \u2014 needs to speak up. New York City public advocate Jumaane Williams told The Times that the mayor needs to \"do something or don't mention Eric Garner's name ever again. ... You cannot be president, you cannot be the Democratic nominee if Daniel Pantaleo is still on the force.\" The chants grew loudest not when de Blasio spoke but during Booker's time. The former Newark, N.J., mayor has pressed de Blasio on the issue, and his staff tweeted during the debate that they welcomed the interruption to draw attention to the controversy, writing, \"good for you. That's how change is made.\" To the folks who were standing up to Mayor de Blasio a few minutes ago\u2014good for you. That's how change is made. #DemDebate https://t.co/zix0UzmZFa De Blasio did later acknowledge the issue on Twitter, writing, \"While I believe that respecting the process is the best way to get justice for Eric Garner's family, I recognize and identify with the pain people across this country are feeling.\" While I believe that respecting the process is the best way to get justice for Eric Garner's family, I recognize and identify with the pain people across this country are feeling. #DemDebate Former Housing and Urban Development Secretary Juli\u00e1n Castro weighed in from the debate stage, saying Pantaleo should be immediately removed from the NYPD. \"Officer Pantaleo used a chokehold that was prohibited by NYPD,\" Castro said. \"He knew what he was doing, that he was killing Eric Garner, and yet he has not been brought to justice. That police officer should be off the street.\" A protester unfurls a banner that says \"Stop all deportations on day one\" as Democratic presidential hopefuls debate.\n                \n                    \n                    Jim Watson/AFP/Getty Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption A protester unfurls a banner that says \"Stop all deportations on day one\" as Democratic presidential hopefuls debate. A separate group of protesters later briefly disrupted the debate to protest former Vice President Joe Biden and the Obama administration's record on immigration. A group who identified themselves as the Cosecha Movement began chanting \"3 million deportations\" and unfurled a banner that read \"Stop all deportations on day one.\" A second protest disruption at #DemDebate, calling out Biden for the Obama administration's \"3 million deportations!\" pic.twitter.com/qn2IWIzsHH The group says it wants a halt to all immigrant detention and deportations on the first day of a new Democratic president's term in office. It's also pushing for  reunification of families separated by deportation under the Trump administration and the immediate legalization of all estimated 11 million people who live in the country illegally. Earlier in the day, the Cosecha Movement had held a protest outside the Detroit theater and blocked traffic at the Detroit-Windsor Tunnel, which is an international border crossing between the U.S. and Canada.

The first leg of the second round of Democratic presidential debates is over, and now it's on to Night 2. Center stage features former Vice President Joe Biden, who has a lot on the line. Sen. Cory Booker of New Jersey has been promising attacks on Biden's racial justice record, and Biden is promising to not be as \"polite\" as he was in the last debate. Night 1 also drew a bold line between moderates and progressives onstage. Expect health care to be a big issue, as it was on Night 1. Sen. Kamala Harris of California unveiled her \"Medicare for All\" plan on Monday, presenting a middle ground between more progressive candidates' stances looking to replace private health insurance and that of Biden, who wants a public option. First, key questions (and answers): When is the debate? Wednesday night's debate begins at 8 p.m. ET. Tuesday's debate lasted two hours and 43 minutes. Which candidates are onstage Wednesday night? In order of how they'll appear on stage: Sen. Michael Bennet of Colorado, Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand of New York, former Housing and Urban Development Secretary Juli\u00e1n Castro of Texas, Sen. Cory Booker of New Jersey, ex-Vice President Joe Biden, Sen. Kamala Harris of California, venture capitalist Andrew Yang, Rep. Tulsi Gabbard of Hawaii, Washington Gov. Jay Inslee and New York Mayor Bill de Blasio. How can I watch? Tune in to CNN, or listen on Westwood One radio. Now, here are five questions about what we might see in the debate: 1. Does Biden recover, and can he deal with the inevitable questions on race? Biden's last debate was not a good one. He said he was unprepared for attacks from Harris, whom he considered a friend. And he didn't expect the line of attack \u2014 on busing in the 1970s. On Wednesday night, he will be sandwiched between Booker and Harris, and candidates are expected to come at Biden from all angles. He has to acquit himself better \u2014 whether it's on race, health care or any other topic \u2014 or his electability bubble could burst. Biden has recovered some from his poll slide after the first debate, but he needs a solid showing. If he doesn't have one, it could leave permanent doubts \u2014 even with voters who like him \u2014 about whether he still has what it takes to take on President Trump. The first 10 candidates discussed race on Tuesday night in Round 1, but it was an all-white stage, and the candidates spent little time on the topic. 2. How far will Gillibrand go in hitting Biden on women's rights \u2014 and how does he respond? Struggling candidates saw what it took in the last debates for others to get attention and rise in the polls: interjecting and going on the attack. Enter Kirsten Gillibrand. She has reportedly been prepping attacks on Biden's record on women's rights, including his 1981 vote against expanding the child tax credit. And last Thursday she went this far on the campaign trail in Iowa: \"We have Democratic candidates running for president right now who do not believe necessarily that it's a good idea that women work outside the home,\" she said in Iowa. She finished it off with a Biden kicker: \"No joke.\" Biden would likely counter that he wrote the Violence Against Women Act and that those attacks are unfair and out of bounds. But he will face the challenge of hitting back without looking disrespectful \u2014 in a Democratic primary \u2014 of women and candidates of color. For Gillibrand's part, she may be asked to respond to the regrets of fellow senators who called on then-Sen. Al Franken of Minnesota to step down amid sexual misconduct allegations. Gillibrand was at the forefront of calling on Franken to step down at the height of the #MeToo movement. 3. How does Harris answer for her health care plan? Critics could argue that the California senator had been somewhat wishy-washy on where she stood exactly on Medicare for All \u2014 until this week. She unveiled her own plan, which envisions a role for private health insurers, breaking from progressives like Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, who would replace private health insurance with Medicare. All that, despite Harris co-sponsoring Sanders' legislation. She is likely going to be asked what changed and be challenged by fellow candidates for trying to be all things to all people. Harris was able to distinguish herself in the first round of debates with an incisive busing attack against Biden, but as she rises, Harris will also likely be targeted \u2014 and there are plenty of things the progressive left doesn't like about her record, including not just her record on health care but her time as attorney general of California. 4. How does Castro fair \u2014 and whom does he go after? Castro used O'Rourke on immigration to get himself some momentum in the first debates. But O'Rourke won't be onstage with Castro this time, and Castro is in desperate shape. So far, he has not qualified for the fall debates, so there's a lot of pressure on him to perform well. Castro, who has met the donor requirement but not the polling one, became a champion of marginalized communities in the first debate. But will he find another potential foil \u2014 and on what issue \u2014 this time? Castro is in a similar position as Yang, a tech investor championing a universal basic income of $1,000 a month to combat automation. Yang has also met only the donor threshold and not the polling requirement, but he got limited time in the first debate. He also needs to become better known to make the fall debates. And that's to say nothing of the candidates who have not met either requirement yet \u2014 like those on Wednesday night's stage, including Bennet, de Blasio, Gabbard, Gillibrand and Inslee. 5. Will there be a resetting of policy priorities? Castro did distinguish himself in the first debate but on areas that the latest NPR/PBS NewsHour/Marist poll found to be not so attractive to a general-election audience, like decriminalizing border crossings, for example. In fact, multiple policies that Democratic candidates have been pushing may be popular with the Democratic Party's base but not with the overall electorate. Democrats are walking a fine line, because even base voters are saying they want someone who can beat President Trump, not necessarily someone who agrees with them on every issue.",

The Democratic presidential candidates take the stage for the second round of debates Tuesday and Wednesday in Detroit. A lot is on the line for the candidates, who have been engaged in back-and-forths over race and health care coming into this round of debates. On Tuesday, progressives Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren face off for the first time in this campaign. And several other candidates will be scrambling for a breakout night to get back on voters' minds. Viewers will also see an odd dynamic onstage \u2014 by luck of the draw, all the candidates onstage on Night 1 are white. So what will people be talking about when it's all said and done? Here's a guide to how to watch and what we're watching. First, key questions (and answers): When is the debate? Tuesday night's debate begins at 8 p.m. ET. It's slated to last at least two hours. Which candidates are onstage Tuesday night? In order of their placement onstage, left to right: Spiritualist and author Marianne Williamson; Rep. Tim Ryan, D-Ohio; Sen. Amy Klobuchar, D-Minn.; South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg; Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt.; Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass.; former Rep. Beto O'Rourke, D-Texas; former Gov. John Hickenlooper, D-Colo.; former Rep. John Delaney, D-Md.; and Gov. Steve Bullock, D-Mont. How can I watch? Tune in to CNN, or listen on Westwood One radio. Now, here are five questions about what we might see in the debate: 1. Will there be any distinctions drawn between Sanders and Warren? Warren and Sanders are vying for similar voters interested in taking the U.S. in a more boldly progressive direction on everything from income inequality and social justice to health care and student debt. And Warren has been gaining on Sanders in national polls and has even overtaken him on some state surveys. The Sanders camp has been clear that Sanders will not go after Warren, because he sees her as an ally in implementing progressive change. But they are competing for the same job, so at some point, that stance will likely have to change if Sanders continues to stagnate in the polls. Whenever he's asked to critique Warren, Sanders dismisses the question and points to his long friendship and working relationship with her. Asked on CNN to say something nice about her, his response was somewhat muted: It's always nice to say something nice about your competitor, right?  I asked @BernieSanders what he admires about @ewarren -- before they face off in the @cnn Debate next week... pic.twitter.com/2rDThtBVdm Will the moderators try to get them to draw distinctions on their polices? There are some differences between them, namely on just how far each wants to go in reshaping the country. Warren wants big structural change but not socialism. Sanders is fine embracing that word. There are also some foreign policy differences that have not been exploited yet in this campaign. Warren talks about how defense-industry moneyed interests shouldn't \"own the table\"; Sanders has deeper misgivings about how U.S. foreign policy has been conducted over the years and has been hotly critical of Israel, which he has said is being run by a \"right wing\" and \"racist\" government. 2. Will some of the air be taken out of Sanders' sails because Biden isn't onstage? Much of Sanders' criticism in recent weeks has been trained on Biden, who has continued to lead in polls despite a lackluster first debate performance. Sanders has, in fact, likened Biden's health care plan \u2014 centered on the existing Affordable Care Act rather than on a national single-payer health insurance program \u2014 to President Trump's. With Biden not on the stage, Sanders is deprived of the chance to swat at Biden face-to-face on that health care plan. His campaign contends that's not a disappointment. \"The truth is, these debates are watched by millions of voters and a great opportunity for every candidate to talk to the American people,\" Jeff Weaver, a senior adviser to Sanders, told NPR's Scott Detrow. \"It really doesn't matter\" who debates what night, he added. \"The lineup's not that important.\" Weaver added: \"Will he be talking about the important issues that affect people's lives? Yes, I expect he will be talking about that again. ... It's not as easy to write a news story about the n-e-w-s,\" he noted, mocking post-debate analysis, \"but the issues he talks about are issues that affect real people's lives.\" Biden may not be onstage, but several others who back similarly moderate health care overhauls will be, including Klobuchar and Hickenlooper. That's a dynamic worth watching, especially since both those candidates need boosts. 3. How is race raised? Though health care may be a prime issue, race has also dominated the run-up to the debates. The odd dynamic, by luck of the draw, is that all the candidates onstage on Night 1 are white. So how does race come up on an all-white stage? It's certainly possible, as Buttigieg has been dealing with a controversy over race and police in his hometown, where he's the mayor. And Warren has certainly put forward a comprehensive plan on racial equality and reducing racial differences in maternal mortality rates, for example. 4. Who breaks out? Looking at who's onstage \u2014 Klobuchar, Buttigieg and O'Rourke certainly need breakout moments. Klobuchar, who has a quick wit, admitted after the first round of debates that she held back. \"I had to sit back and say, 'This is the first debate,' \" the Minnesota senator said afterward on MSNBC. She noted that she would have liked to have talked more about farm policy and Russian election interference. After former special counsel Robert Mueller's testimony, perhaps there will be opportunities to talk about what the Trump administration is \u2014 or isn't \u2014 doing to stop current and future foreign interference in elections. Either way, these three need to establish themselves for a national audience. No two candidates saw faster rises and more mediocre weeks and months after those rises than Buttigieg and O'Rourke. The last round of debates really did nothing to help either of them. That's going to have to change if they want to be seen as serious contenders for the nomination again. Candidates Kamala Harris and Juli\u00e1n Castro made the most of their first debate performances in Miami, putting them back on the lips of voters in early campaign states. Klobuchar, Buttigieg and O'Rourke need to do the same after these Detroit debates. Then there's Montana Gov. Steve Bullock. He was left off the stage in the first round of debates, causing controversy. Bullock has made the case that he has been able to win in a red state where Trump did well \u2014 and that those rural, right-leaning voters should not be ignored. So how does Bullock present that message now that he will be onstage? And does it resonate with a Democratic primary base that has been itching for big, bold change with Trump in office, rather than moving rightward in any way? 5. Without hand-raising, will we get answers that are as clear? The candidates and Democratic National Committee have mandated that after the first round of debates, there will be no hand-raising questions. That may be because some of the topics that candidates raised their hands to favor have been revealed to not be very popular, according to an NPR/PBS NewsHour/Marist poll conducted after the first debates. The poll tested some of those policies and found, for example, that being in favor of \"Medicare for All\" as a replacement to the current private health insurance system might be popular with the Democratic base but is unpopular with a general-election electorate \u2014 just 41% overall said it is a good idea. Compare that with the 70% who said Medicare as an option while maintaining private health insurance is a good idea. Being in favor of giving health insurance to immigrants in the U.S. illegally and decriminalizing border crossings are also popular with the base but unpopular with the general-election electorate. So how will the candidates talk about those things? Watch for hedging and equivocation. Scott Detrow contributed to this report.",

            "article_content": "Presidential candidate Juli\u00e1n Castro made an impression at the first Democratic debate by proposing decriminalizing illegal border crossings. He discussed that and more with the NPR Politics Podcast.  MARY LOUISE KELLY, HOST: Former Housing and Urban Development Secretary Julian Castro was one of the stars of the first Democratic presidential debate. Now we are one week out from the second debate, and the onetime rising star of the Democratic Party is struggling to break out from the clump of candidates polling below 2%. Castro talked about that challenge with the NPR Politics Podcast and New Hampshire Public Radio. As NPR's Scott Detrow reports, Castro also spoke about how Democrats should respond to President Trump's attacks. SCOTT DETROW, BYLINE: Julian Castro expects many more weeks of the 2020 presidential campaign to play out like the past one - it was dominated by divisive presidential tweets, Democratic responses to those tweets, rallies centered around those tweets and so on. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED NPR BROADCAST) JULIAN CASTRO: His specialty, if you will, in politics is division, trying to just amp up a base. He's the biggest identity politician that we've had over the last 50 years. DETROW: Castro says the challenge for Democrats is to effectively counterprogram President Trump - to respond to attacks, but to also offer up the party's own vision of the country. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED NPR BROADCAST) CASTRO: I believe in an America where our leadership actually says, we're better because of our differences. DETROW: Castro has rolled out an aggressive immigration plan which would decriminalize unauthorized border crossings. Trump calls it open borders, and there's a risk it could turn off more moderate voters. But Castro says, in the end, he's banking on more voters agreeing with him than agreeing with the president. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED NPR BROADCAST) CASTRO: What he's betting on is that he's going to be able to get every little bit of base support out there and barely, narrowly win another electoral college victory, lose the popular vote again. But I believe that enough people who bought into Donald Trump three years ago in 2016 have buyer's remorse. DETROW: Castro first came on to the national political scene in 2012 when he delivered the keynote address at the Democratic Convention. He was the young mayor of San Antonio, Texas. Later on, President Obama tapped him to head the Department of Housing and Urban Development. And all along the way, Castro has been accompanied by his identical twin brother, Joaquin, who's now a Texas congressman and the chair of his presidential campaign. Their parallel rise has been very public, but Castro says it took a while to develop a real emotional bond. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED NPR BROADCAST) CASTRO: It's almost like the closeness is assumed, somehow, because you're moving through the world constantly together - we shared bunk beds for a long time; we went to college together, went to law school together, you know, started practicing law together, went into politics together - that in some ways, there's such a closeness and then, in some ways, a distance. DETROW: In fact, Castro told NHPR's Lauren Chooljian and me that he doesn't remember even hugging his brother until college. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED NPR BROADCAST) CASTRO: In fact, right after we won our election for the student senate - like, we tied. And we found out - we got this news that we had tied for first place, and we, like, kind of spontaneously hugged each other. But this wasn't something that we would, you know... LAUREN CHOOLJIAN: Why do you think that is? CASTRO: ...Do all the time. I think that men in general have issues with showing emotion and relating to each other that way. DETROW: In the wake of that first presidential debate, Castro is drawing larger crowds and raising more money. But Castro admits he's still behind and that he needs another big performance next week. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED NPR BROADCAST) CASTRO: Well, I have the same goal. The goal is to introduce myself to a lot of people who still may not know who I am - because my name ID is still lower than some of the other candidates - and to articulate a strong, positive vision for how all Americans can prosper in the years ahead. I want to connect with voters about what they and their family need. DETROW: Castro will debate on the second night next week, when former Vice President Joe Biden and California Senator Kamala Harris will be center stage. Scott Detrow, NPR News, Concord, N.H.

Updated at 12:20 p.m. ET Democratic presidential candidates are proposing lots of progressive policies in this election. And while those policies may resonate with the party base, some of those ideas are not popular with a general election electorate, according to a new NPR/PBS NewsHour/Marist poll. And overall, independent voters said they were not impressed with the direction either President Trump or Democrats want to take the country at this point ahead of the 2020 election, the findings show. \"Independents are on the fence overall,\" said Lee Miringoff, director of the Marist Institute for Public Opinion at Marist College, which conducted the poll. \"They're not willing to grant President Trump reelection, and yet they're not persuaded by Democrats at this point.\" Trump did his best in this polling since taking office, but his approval rating is still just 44%. Fewer independents are undecided about the president and give him a 42% approval rating, up from 35% in June. The poll was conducted from July 15 to 17, after the president's July 14 tweet that four Democratic congresswomen of color, all American citizens, should \"go back\" to their countries of origin. The poll of 1,336 adults has a margin of error of plus or minus 3.5 percentage points. Loading... Don't see the graphic above? Click here. What's more, by a 53%-to-39% margin, Americans said they would definitely vote against Trump, statistically unchanged from a month ago; 54% of American voters did not vote for Trump in 2016. Among independents, a third said they would definitely vote for the president, up from one quarter. A majority \u2014 54% \u2014 say they definitely won't, about the same as last month. The economy There's a tremendous gap between views of the president overall and how Americans feel about the economy. Even though Trump gets just a 44% approval rating overall, 52% of registered voters approve of his handling of the economy and two-thirds \u2014 65% \u2014 of Americans think the economy is working well for them, including 62% of independents. \"Independents are pleased with the economy, but it is not converting to a strong endorsement on his [Trump's] reelect question,\" Miringoff said. So there's a political opportunity for Democrats. But what Americans have heard about the primary so far is not necessarily giving them confidence that Democrats offer a better way. Americans split 46%-to-43% on whether Democrats would take the country in the wrong direction or right one. And with all-important independents, more (48%) think Democrats would take the country in the wrong direction than the right one (40%). Democratic loyalists vs. independent voters There are areas in which Democrats' policy proposals are on solid footing with the overall electorate: -- Requiring background checks for gun purchases or private sales (89% say it's good idea) -- Medicare for all who want it, presenting it as an option (70%) rather than doing away completely with private health insurance (41%) -- Regulating prescription drug prices (67%) -- Providing a pathway to citizenship for immigrants in the U.S. illegally (64%) -- Investing in so-called green jobs and energy efficient infrastructure (63%) -- Increasing taxes on those making more than $1 million (62%) -- Legalizing marijuana (63%) -- Banning assault-style weapons (57%) -- Raising the federal minimum wage to $15 an hour (56%) Areas that are less popular include: -- A guaranteed universal basic income of $1,000 per month for American adults (26%) -- Providing reparations for slavery (27%) -- Decriminalizing illegal border crossings (27%) -- A national health insurance program that is available to immigrants in the country illegally (33%) -- Abolishing the death penalty (36%) -- Medicare for all replacing private health insurance (41%) -- Getting rid of the Electoral College (42%) \"These would be issues where people would say the Democratic Party is too far to the left,\" Miringoff said, \"and that's warranted within the data.\" On \"Medicare for All,\" \"whether it is a choice or a replacement is a huge distinction in terms of how the public reacts,\" Miringoff added. On rejoining the Paris climate agreement, 53% think it's a good idea and just 31% think it's a bad idea, but that leaves many undecided. People are split or give less support to: giving free college tuition at public colleges and universities (53% said good idea, 43% said bad idea); a tax on carbon-based fuels such as coal, oil and natural gas (50% vs. 44%). Repealing Obamacare unpopular One area that jumps out as a warning for Republicans is repealing the Affordable Care Act. Just 44% think it's a good idea, while 51% think it's a bad one. The degree to which the tide has turned on that issue is remarkable considering how much the fight over so-called Obamacare helped Republicans in 2010 while President Barack Obama was in office. Republicans voted to repeal the law dozens of times while Obama was in office, but with full control in Washington during Trump's first two years, they were not able to repeal or replace the health care law in full. The divided states of America One major takeaway from the poll is that America is a nation divided. Democrats and Republicans are worlds apart on the things they think are good ideas. Some of the widest splits on what the parties thought were good ideas were: -- Rejoining the Paris climate agreement (63 points) -- Investing in green jobs (60 points) -- Repealing Obamacare (60 points) -- $15 minimum wage (58 points) -- Free college at public colleges and universities (57 points) -- Increasing taxes on those making more than $1 million (56 points) -- Health care for immigrants in country illegally (54 points) -- Semi-automatic weapons ban (54 points) Loading... Don't see the graphic above? Click here. Of the 20 policy proposals respondents were asked about, many of which have been floated by Democratic presidential candidates, a majority of Democrats were in favor of 16 of them. A majority of independents thought 12 were good ideas, while a majority of Republicans, as to be expected, were in favor of just three \u2014 repealing Obamacare, stricter gun background checks and regulating prescription drug prices. 2020 Democratic primary There are lots of reasons to discount who has the early lead in primary polls, and that is borne out again in this survey \u2014 82% of Democrats or Democratic-leaning independents say they have not yet made up their mind in the Democratic primary. That is pretty much unchanged from a month ago, when 84% said their minds were not yet made up. A majority (54%) though say they want a nominee who can beat Trump rather than one who shares their position on most issues (42%). That's a 13-point swing from last month when 47% said they wanted someone who shared their position on most issues versus 46% who said they wanted someone who has the best chance of beating Trump. The poll of 1,346 adults was conducted from July 15 to 17. The respondents were reached by telephone, both cellphone and landline, with live callers. It has a margin of error of +/- 3.5 percentage points. The survey reached 1,175 registered voters and has a margin of error for that group of +/- 3.7 percentage points. There were 553 Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents interviewed. Results referring to Democrats' views therefore have a margin of error of +/- 5.4 percentage points.",

All will be back for next week's rounds. The 20-person lineup for the two-night Democratic presidential debate on July 30 and 31 will look familiar, with just one change from last month's event. Last week, California Rep. Eric Swalwell became the first major candidate to end his White House bid. Montana Gov. Steve Bullock \u2014 after only narrowly missing the mark last time \u2014 will take his place. The criteria for the second debate was the same as the first, requiring hopefuls to meet either a polling or fundraising benchmark. A candidate must have registered at least 1% in three polls recognized by the Democratic National Committee. Or the candidates must have 65,000 donors, with at least 200 donors in 20 states. Fourteen candidates met both requirements \u2014 former Vice President Joe Biden, California Sen. Kamala Harris, New Jersey Sen. Cory Booker, South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg, former Housing and Urban Development Secretary Juli\u00e1n Castro, Hawaii Rep. Tulsi Gabbard, New York Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand,  Washington Gov. Jay Inslee, Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar, former Texas Rep. Beto O'Rourke, Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren, author and spiritual adviser Marianne Williamson, and entrepreneur Andrew Yang. Loading... The remaining six candidates made the cut because of their standing in the polls, but did not meet the donor threshold \u2014 Bullock, Colorado Sen. Michael Bennet, New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio, former Maryland Rep. John Delaney, former Colorado Gov. John Hickenlooper and Ohio Rep. Tim Ryan. Former Alaska Sen. Mike Gravel qualified based on donations alone, but under the DNC formula, polling is given greater weight, thus he didn't make the cut. Ten candidates will be debating each night. Other major candidates left off the stage include Massachusetts Rep. Seth Moulton and Miramar, Fla., Mayor Wayne Messam. Former Pennsylvania Rep. Joe Sestak, who just entered the race late last month, and billionaire executive and activist Tom Steyer, who reversed his initial decision to pass on the race last week, also haven't qualified, with little time to register in polls or raise money. CNN, which is hosting this next series of debates in Detroit, will hold a live drawing on Thursday at 8 p.m. ET to determine which candidates will appear on which night. That's where the real shake-up will happen, shuffling which White House hopefuls get to face off against one another and which will have a chance to take aim at the top-tier candidates. In the first debate, Harris seized her chance against Biden in the second night of the debate. She went after him over his past opposition to mandated busing to integrate schools in the 1970s, and Biden faltered in his response. That helped her rise in many polls. On the first debate night, Castro found a chance to emerge from the pack after taking a firm stance on decriminalizing illegal border crossings and taking on fellow Texan O'Rourke's reluctance to back such a change. Castro saw his fundraising surge while O'Rourke has continued to struggle. The stakes of performing well in the July debate could be high for several candidates. The criteria for the third debate in September is expected to winnow the field further. Candidates will have to register at least 2% in at least four national or statewide polls recognized by the committee and get donations from at least 130,000 unique donors, along with 400 unique donors in 20 states. If a candidate does not hit both benchmarks, they will be off the stage.",

Even from the beginning, Mitch McConnell and Donald Trump had a complicated relationship. In 1989, McConnell was running for reelection to the Senate. As he once told a Senate committee, the reason he and other lawmakers spent much of their time fundraising was because \"we like to win.\" And that fall, he received a $1,000 campaign check (the legal maximum at the time) from one prolific political donor: then-real estate developer and author of the bestselling The Art Of The Deal Donald J. Trump. But in 1990, Trump's financial fortunes \u2014 and the headlines he generated \u2014 changed. Many of his casinos were underperforming, some on the verge of bankruptcy. And Forbes magazine dropped Trump from its annual list of the 400 wealthiest people, saying that his fortune was \"within hailing distance of zero.\" According to recent reporting by the New York Times, Trump lost a combined $517.6 million between 1990 and 1991. Embedded featuring Taking Cover\n                \n                    \n                    NPR\n                    \n                \nhide caption McConnell's opponent in his Senate race, Democrat Harvey Sloane, started criticizing the freshman senator for getting out-of-state campaign contributions like the check from Trump. \"Kentucky needs a relatively obscure senator as much as Donald Trump needs another casino,\" Sloane said, according to an Associated Press story at the time. Facing attacks from his opponent and bad headlines, McConnell tried to distance himself from the donation. McConnell said he'd never met Trump personally, and then he actually decided to return the $1,000 campaign check to Trump. \"While I thank you for your contribution, I have noticed several stories in the last few weeks about your financial difficulties,\" McConnell wrote in a letter to Trump, which was also provided to the press. \"Although I am certain you will recover,\" McConnell went on, \"I have decided to return your contribution of $1,000, because it appears you may need the money more than I do right now.\" \"It appears you may need the money more than I do right now.\" Sen. Mitch McConnell, R-Ky. 1990 The returned check did not make much of a dent in Trump's debts. The Trump Taj Mahal actually filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection the next year. The White House did not respond to NPR's request for comment. It was an uncomfortable beginning to what would go on to become, decades later, one of the most important, if complicated, relationships in politics. \"Not a happy choice\" There are few Republicans more different from each other than McConnell and Trump. \"I couldn't write the story to have two people who were more unlike than those two,\" says Janet Mullins Grissom, who served as McConnell's campaign manager and chief of staff in the 1980s. Embedded featuring Taking Cover\n                \n                    \n                    NPR\n                    \n                \nhide caption Despite their differences, these two politicians have gone from publicly feuding to largely embracing each other's agendas. In the summer of 2016, McConnell was on tour promoting his recently published memoir, The Long Game. But it was the middle of the presidential election, and people wanted to know how McConnell felt about Trump, then the presumptive Republican nominee. By that time, Trump had said Republican Sen. John McCain of Arizona was not a war hero, mocked a reporter with a disability, and proposed banning all Muslims from entering the United States. Trump had also said a federal judge whose parents emigrated from Mexico could not be impartial in a lawsuit against Trump University, because Trump was promising to build a wall on the southern border. \"Mitch was not thrilled when Trump was last man standing and got the nomination,\" says Grissom. \"He didn't keep it a secret.\" In an interview with PBS NewsHour, McConnell condemned Trump's comments about the judge, calling them \"outrageous and inappropriate.\" \"[There are] plenty of things he ought to be talking about, rather than taking shots at Americans because of their ethnicity,\" McConnell said. \"The choice for many Americans,\" McConnell said of the election between Trump and Hillary Clinton, \"is not a happy choice.\" \"It's pretty obvious [Trump] doesn't know a lot about the issues,\" McConnell told Bloomberg's \"Masters In Politics\" podcast. The show's host, Betsy Fischer Martin, asked McConnell if there was a line Trump could cross, at which point McConnell would withdraw his support. \"I'm not going to speculate about what he might say or what I might do,\" McConnell said. \"But I think it's pretty clear, I've been very clear publicly, about how I think he ought to change directions. And I hope that's what we're going to see.\" Trump's election in 2016 caught many by surprise, including McConnell. \"They didn't have the kind of relationship that a lot of Republican leaders would have with an incoming Republican president,\" says political strategist Josh Holmes, a former chief of staff to McConnell. \"So you had to start from scratch in some ways.\" But even after winning the presidency, Trump's rhetoric \u2014 particularly toward his personal and political opponents \u2014 largely did not change. And so McConnell time and again has been asked to answer a version of that same question: What would it take for the Senate majority leader to break from the president? Avoiding a \"public war\" with Trump For some, a critical line came in August 2017, after the deadly Unite The Right rally in Charlottesville, Va. In a news conference, Trump said there were \"very fine people\" on both sides of the white supremacist rally. Many rushed to condemn the president's remarks. But McConnell's response was more tempered. In a sign of just how complicated his relationship with Trump had become, McConnell's wife, Secretary of Transportation Elaine Chao, was standing behind the president during his remarks.

At that news conference, Trump delivered widely condemned remarks describing \"very fine people on both sides\" of a deadly white supremacist rally in Charlottesville, Va. \"There are no good neo-Nazis, and those who espouse their views are not supporters of American ideals and freedoms,\" McConnell's office said in a written statement at the time. \"We all have a responsibility to stand against hate and violence, wherever it raises its evil head.\" The statement does not mention Trump's name or specifically reference the president's controversial remarks. NPR specifically asked McConnell why he did not mention the president in his statement after the events in Charlottesville. In an email, he responded, \"Messages of hate and bigotry are not welcome in Kentucky and should not be welcome anywhere in America.\" Republican strategist Antonia Ferrier, a former communications adviser to McConnell, says she believes McConnell is more effective keeping much of his criticism private. \"Getting into a public war with Donald Trump is usually not a good thing from anyone's perspective,\" says Ferrier, \"especially if you're trying to keep an even-keeled ship moving forward.\" \"I think one of the most important things McConnell has done is normalize Donald Trump,\" says Al Cross, a Kentucky-based journalist who has covered McConnell for decades. \"He treats him as an entirely legitimate president.\" Based on his decades of experience covering and interviewing McConnell, Cross says he believes McConnell privately \"abhors\" Trump's behavior. And yet McConnell is careful to avoid publicly breaking with the president. Journalist Keith Runyon, a former editorial page editor of the Louisville Courier-Journal who has known McConnell since the 1970s, says he wishes McConnell would use his leadership role to publicly denounce Trump's rhetoric. \"If he were to do that, he would earn a chapter in Profiles in Courage,\" says Runyon, referring to John F. Kennedy's book on political acts of bravery. \"I think Mitch has it in him,\" Runyon says. \"I hope he does. But I don't know.\" \"I'm not a mirror image of the president.\" In an interview with NPR's Embedded podcast, McConnell says there's a simple explanation for his public support for the president \u2014 and his general reluctance to publicly break with him. \"What [Democrats] would hope is we would join them and torpedo him and do nothing,\" McConnell says. \"I mean that's not my idea of what our responsibility is.\" Embedded featuring Taking Cover\n                \n                    \n                    NPR\n                    \n                \nhide caption \"There are many things that he's willing to go along with that are consistent with what members of my party have thought for years ought to be done,\" McConnell says, citing tax cuts and regulatory rollbacks, for example. McConnell has also worked closely with the Trump administration to confirm conservative judges to the federal courts. Together, they have already confirmed more than 40 judges to the U.S. Court of Appeals, meaning more than 20% of all circuit court judges were nominated by Trump. McConnell notes that he has disagreed with Trump about trade and tariffs, as well as support for NATO. \"I'm not a mirror image of the president. But I'm glad he got elected,\" McConnell says. \"It doesn't mean you're devoid of principle. But you have to make compromises and you have to try to advance the ball or you make no difference.\" The government shutdown and an \"uncharacteristic\" move Cross, who is also the director of the Institute for Rural Journalism and Community Issues at the University of Kentucky, says that pattern has held even during one of the most consequential moments of Trump's presidency, the partial government shutdown in the winter of 2018-2019. McConnell has long been on the record opposing government shutdowns and executive overreach. When the government shut down under President Barack Obama, he called shutdowns a \"losing strategy.\" When Obama pushed executive actions to prevent deportations, McConnell said, \"The action he's proposed would ignore the law, would reject the voice of the voters.\" But McConnell's opposition to shutdowns did not prevent this outcome: The partial government shutdown ultimately became the longest in American history. And McConnell ultimately said he supported Trump's declaration of a national emergency to divert funds to construct a border wall, even without the approval of Congress. Given McConnell's stated record on government shutdowns and executive actions, Cross calls it, \"one of the most uncharacteristic things he has ever done.\" In a statement, McConnell's office told NPR, \"There [was and continues to be] a clear border security and humanitarian crisis on our southern border.\" \"Sometimes you have to make sacrifices or compromises to do what you think is for the greater good,\" says Ferrier. Navigating Kentucky politics Cross says McConnell's embrace of Trump has another motivation: getting reelected in Kentucky in 2020. According to polling from Morning Consult, McConnell is the least popular senator in the country. \"And because Donald Trump is very popular in Kentucky,\" Cross says, \"that means not getting much distance between himself and Donald Trump.\" Democrat Amy McGrath, a retired Marine Corps fighter pilot, announced this week that she will challenge McConnell in 2020. Former McConnell adviser Holmes told Politico that anyone who entered the race would face \"a symphony of absolute destruction\" from McConnell and his allies, and the McConnell campaign has already released a video attacking McGrath. The campaign argues that she poses a threat to \"passing President Trump's agenda, confirming conservative judges, even our Republican Senate Majority itself.\" McConnell is also counting on Trump's support in the election. On Tuesday, Trump tweeted his support for McConnell's 2020 run, saying, \"We need Mitch in the Senate to Keep America Great!!\" President Trump speaks with Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell as they head to an election rally in Kentucky in 2018.\n                \n                    \n                    Andrew Harnik/AP\n                    \n                \nhide caption President Trump speaks with Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell as they head to an election rally in Kentucky in 2018. At a late 2018 rally in Richmond, Ky., McConnell and Trump shared a stage and paid each other many compliments. Trump said McConnell was \"one of the most powerful men in the world,\" calling him \"rock-ribbed\" and \"Kentucky Tough.\" \"Aren't we proud of President Trump?\" McConnell asked the thousands in attendance. The event was a remarkable turnaround from 2016, when McConnell was openly critical of the president, and from 1990, when McConnell could mock Trump's financial misfortune. McConnell's campaign is now selling T-shirts for his reelection with the slogan \"Kentucky Tough.\"",

When Sen. Kamala Harris of California launched her presidential campaign in January and drew a crowd of 20,000 in Oakland, Calif., she raised some eyebrows about the potential for her candidacy. But during the early stretch of this Democratic primary campaign, Harris struggled to catch on or stand apart \u2014 until Thursday night. Harris showed in the second night of the first Democratic presidential primary debate why so many thought she had such promise as a candidate from the beginning. She commanded the stage, was crisp, and showed skill and courage in going after former Vice President Joe Biden. Credit:  Michael Zamora/NPR Here are five takeaways from the second night of debates: 1. Harris needed a breakout moment, and she got it Harris had more than one good moment during Thursday night's debate. In a debate where the candidates were much more willing to engage than they were on Wednesday night, Harris interjected early on and grabbed the spotlight. As several candidates talked over each other, she said, \"America does not want to witness a food fight; they want to know how we are going to put food on their table.\" Then she was impassioned, direct and specific when talking about immigration and what she would do in her early days as president to deal with the issue. But the key exchange of the debate was when she took on Biden over race. He had been on the defensive coming into the debate for his comments at a fundraiser about how he worked with people in the Senate, even segregationists with whom he disagreed. Harris said she has respect for Biden and did not believe Biden is a racist, but was clear and direct about how she felt he handled it and then invoked her own childhood of having been bused as part of school integration. And Biden didn't seem to know which direction to go with the line of attack. He got out of it by saying, \"Anyway, my time's up.\" 2. Biden did not have a good night Former Vice President Joe Biden, left, and Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont stand next to each other during the second night of Democratic presidential debates.\n                \n                    \n                    Drew Angerer/Getty Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption Former Vice President Joe Biden, left, and Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont stand next to each other during the second night of Democratic presidential debates. On everything from defending his comments about those segregationist senators to his Iraq War vote to what would be the first things he would do as president (defeat Donald Trump), Biden looked out of touch with the Democratic Party of 2019. What's worse, though, is what a debate like this could do to the premise of his candidacy \u2014 that he's the strongest candidate to take on President Trump. That's what's been holding Biden up in the polls, and he can't afford to have his electability bubble pierced and look like a risky choice to put on stage against Trump. Biden has a reservoir of support and good feelings within the party, so he can't be written off after one night, but his best hope might be that lots of people aren't tuned in yet and were watching something else \u2014 or went to bed early. 3. Sanders and Buttigieg were flat Sanders was the one itching for the fight with Biden, but Harris stole his thunder. Sanders has been saying the same things for 40 years about the problems facing the country, and it sounded like it on Thursday night. What was remarkable was that, despite his usual fluidity with what he sees as systemic problems afflicting America, he couldn't muster up what his priorities would be to accomplish his \"revolution.\" Every president has had to prioritize. President Barack Obama had to try and shore up the economy with the Recovery Act after the Great Recession; then, to the consternation of immigration activists, he went for health care. Those are the real, practical choices a president has to make as a legislative strategy, and Sanders simply criticized the moderator for being reductive. Pete Buttigieg struggled to command the stage in what was his biggest opportunity to speak to his widest audience yet about his message of generational change. But the racially polarizing police shooting in South Bend, Ind., where he is mayor, has consumed his campaign in the past couple of weeks. For his part, Buttigieg was ready for the questions about why black representation on his police force has not improved during his tenure (\"Because I couldn't get it done\"). He fell on his sword in a show of humility rarely seen in politics, but how that will play with voters is unclear. Some will undoubtedly like and respect it; others might see it as weakness, especially facing a candidate in Trump who apologizes for nothing. 4. The candidates showed themselves to be very liberal Democrats, living under Trump, are mad as hell, and they are frustrated. The past few presidential elections have had even more extreme pendulum swings than the last \u2014 George W. Bush resulted in Barack Obama, who was followed by Trump. So it might make sense then that Democrats are proposing policies that are very liberal and make them feel good. Here's some of what they are proposing (with who said they support them), based on two nights of debates: The problem is some of this is not very popular. Medicare for All is popular as a slogan, for example, but eliminating private health insurance is not. Some 6 in 10 people are against it, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation. (*Harris told NBC after the debate that she misunderstood that question, and that she was saying she would abolish her own private insurance plan \u2014 not everyone else's.) Part of this more liberal shift within the party is a reaction to Trump. And part of it is because the party has gotten more liberal. In 2003, during the Bush administration, two-thirds of Democrats considered themselves \"moderate\" or \"conservative.\" Today, that's only about half, while the number of Democrats considering themselves \"liberal\" has gone up from 29% to 46% in the past 16 years. The priorities of voters who align with the parties have changed over the last two decades \u2014 and moved farther apart. 5. The race was reshaped after a two-day debate If it was clear going into Wednesday and Thursday's extended debate that Biden and Sanders were the clear leaders in the field, that is simply not the case now. Instead, Harris and Warren proved their mettle. What was clear, perhaps, is that while there are a lot of candidates, there are really only about half a dozen who have stood out. Biden and Sanders will still be in the mix, as are Sens. Cory Booker of New Jersey and Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota. And former Obama administration Housing and Urban Development Secretary Juli\u00e1n Castro was one lower-tier candidate who was able to vault himself into the conversation. Meanwhile, former Rep. Beto O'Rourke of Texas and Biden may have hurt themselves most of all the leading candidates. One thing is clear \u2014 there is a generational battle going on within the Democratic Party, and a lot of it centers on views of race and identity in a campaign that has the most diverse field in the history of presidential campaigns. That's especially prominent in the age of Trump and stands in stark contrast to the way he has campaigned and governed.",

Cory Booker and Kirsten Gillibrand are among the presidential candidates to back Sen. Bernie Sanders' \"Medicare-for-all\" legislation, but even some Democrats who co-sponsored it have welcomed other policies. On Wednesday and Thursday, 20 candidates will take the Democratic debate stage to talk about a wide range of policy topics. And 20 candidates times dozens of policies equals a lot to keep track of. It's true that, these being Democratic candidates, there's a lot they all agree on \u2014 taking action on climate change, for example, or improving the health care system. But this debate is the first time we'll see them next to each other, coming into direct conflict over what, exactly, they disagree on. With all that in mind, what follows is a primer on the main policy questions we'll be watching for at the first Democratic debates. 1) Health care: What, specifically, do the candidates want? Sen. Bernie Sanders' \"Medicare-for-all\" plan has played a huge role in setting the terms of the health care conversation. That plan is a single-payer plan, meaning it would create a government-run insurance program financed by taxpayers. Four of Sanders' Democratic opponents have signed on as \"Medicare-for-all\" co-sponsors in the Senate, and three have co-sponsored a House single-payer bill. But that doesn't mean they've all landed firmly on Sanders' plan as the best option. California Sen. Kamala Harris, for example, has waffled on whether she would be in favor of eliminating private insurance \u2014 and \"Medicare-for-all\" would virtually eliminate private insurance. One reason this matters: Polls show that many voters don't entirely understand \"Medicare-for-all.\" When they do find that out, polling has shown, support tends to drop. So one important question is whether candidates would be OK with that kind of dramatic step. And if not, what sort of plan do they want? Some candidates, like Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren, are open to \"Medicare-for-all\" as well as other options. Others, like Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar, have said a public option in addition to private insurance is best for now. Pinning all the candidates down on exactly how big of a change they want to make will be a huge question. 2) Climate change: How much daylight between candidates? After being a lower-tier issue for years among Democrats, climate change has taken center stage. And a lot like \"Medicare-for-all\" in the health care debate, the sweeping Green New Deal has set the terms of the climate discussion. Except the Green New Deal isn't a policy \u2014 it's more of a broad framework that sets out big goals. So a thing to listen for at the debates is how specific candidates get \u2014 and, in the process, how much they end up differing from each other \u2014 on what, exactly, to do about climate change. How much federal money would they spend? What role could nuclear energy play? Is a carbon tax part of the plan? 3) Immigration: How far will they go beyond criticizing Trump? The Trump administration's family separation policy, as well as the conditions in facilities holding migrant children, have angered many Americans \u2014 Democrats especially. So when immigration comes up at the debates, you can expect candidates to castigate the Trump administration for these policies. But the question is what else they suggest doing beyond reversing President Trump's policies. What might a path to citizenship look like? Do they plan to amp up personnel to deal with the backlog of immigration and asylum cases? Do they want to expand border security or border barriers? In addition, many people coming to the United States illegally are fleeing some sort of terrible circumstances in their home countries \u2014 economic ruin, for example, or gang violence. So what would any of these prospective presidents want to do to try to change those conditions abroad, particularly in Central America? 4) Trade: Will Democrats' big rifts expose themselves? Trade is an area where there's room for Democratic candidates to really differ. As vice president, Joe Biden \u2014 along with plenty of Democrats \u2014 pushed the Trans-Pacific Partnership, a massive deal meant to open up Asian markets and attempt to set the rules for China. But this created a big rift within the left, as figures like Sanders and Warren were staunchly opposed to the deal, saying it was bad for American workers. Hillary Clinton eventually came out against it in her 2016 primary run against Sanders. And that message \u2014 that trade hurts American workers \u2014 is one that President Trump ran heavily on in 2016. In fact, Sanders and Warren both applauded Trump's exit from the Trans-Pacific Partnership. So when trade deals come up, they have the potential to open a clear divide in the pool of Democratic candidates. As with immigration, it could be easy for Democrats to simply blast Trump's actions. But if the debates dig into what they would actually want to do once in office \u2014 Try to get into more multilateral deals, like the Trans-Pacific Partnership? Repeal all of Trump's tariffs? \u2014 it could lead to some genuine disagreements on the stage. 5) Foreign policy: Which fires to put out and in what order? All these candidates are auditioning to be commander in chief at a time of growing international tensions \u2014 most notably, the recent escalating tensions with Iran, almost culminating in U.S. strikes and eventually new sanctions. So these candidates could face some tough questions: How would the U.S. deal with Iran? Was it wrong for Trump to sit down with Kim Jong Un? How do you stop election interference by Russia and others? It's not just about enemies and frenemies either. Candidates must also consider how they would repair relationships with allies that Trump has strained, as well as how they might want to improve America's standing in the eyes of the world. 6) Race-conscious policies: How would you alleviate racial inequality? The topic of reparations has become a key economic policy issue in the 2020 campaign. Many of the Democratic presidential candidates support H.R. 40, a House resolution to create a commission to study reparations for African Americans. It's a policy that could prove divisive among voters; an April poll from Fox News found that just over half of Democrats approve of reparations, and that only one-third of Americans do. Beyond that, candidates take different tacks in how they would specifically work to benefit racial minorities. Some have explicitly race-based economic proposals, like Warren's plan to boost minority-owned small businesses. Other proposals, like Sen. Cory Booker's \"baby bonds\" proposal, are race blind but would stand to particularly boost black and Hispanic Americans. Criminal justice is another area where candidates have attempted to reduce inequality; Cory Booker's clemency plan, released last week, aims to lessen racial sentencing disparities. 7) Priorities: What will the candidates throw their weight behind? Each of these candidates has taken positions (or made vague pronouncements) on dozens of issues. But they can't do everything \u2014 overhauling health care, criminal justice, democratic procedures and tax policy in one term would be virtually impossible. So they'll have to prioritize. And one thing we're watching closely for is what candidates would tackle first. What issues are so important that they would spend their precious political capital on them right after inauguration?",

President Trump is set to run against a wide-open Democratic field of candidates, which he is trying to define as extreme. President Trump officially launched his 2020 reelection bid on Tuesday at a massive rally in Orlando, though much of the event picked up where his 2016 campaign left off. Trump relished in reliving his unlikely victory 2 1/2 years ago over Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton. As the crowd broke into chants of \"lock her up,\" he teased about still trying to search for missing emails on her private server and the possibility his Justice Department could look into prosecuting the former secretary of state. Trump railed against the media, calling reporters in the room \"fake news\" amid jeers of \"CNN sucks!\" from the crowd. And Trump blasted former special counsel Robert Mueller's long investigation as a \"hoax,\" claiming falsely that it cleared him of any collusion or obstruction. The speech was full of grievances, occasionally mixed with accomplishments, which was pure Trump \u2014 far from the optimistic tone most presidents typically take when announcing their reelection bids. It further showed how little impulse Trump has to move from a divisive, base-driven approach that brought him victory in 2016. It featured more complaints against his critics than concrete promises, and only near the end did he push the success of the economy, which most GOP strategists would rather he focus on heavily, rather than more controversial issues like immigration or continuing to talk about the Mueller inquiry. But Trump argued that his own anger and that of his biggest backers who regularly pack his rallies is completely justified. \"They tried to erase your vote, your legacy of the greatest campaign and the greatest election probably in the history of our country,\" Trump said to cheers, painting both himself and his supporters as the victims of Democratic investigations run amok. \"[Democrats] wanted to deny you the future you demanded and the future America deserves and that now America is getting,\" he continued. \"Our radical Democrat opponents are driven by hatred, prejudice and rage. They want to destroy you, and they want to destroy our country as we know it.\" Trump's potential 2020 Democratic rivals \u2014 who will take the stage next week in their first two-night debate \u2014 would argue it's his campaign that has been fueled by those same emotions that the president is pinning on them, as his supporters chanted \"Build that wall!\" and he threatened on Tuesday to deport \"millions\" of immigrants in the U.S. illegally as early as next week. The president called for any persons seeking to immigrate to the U.S. do so on the basis of merit, and he accused Democrats of not being supportive of border patrol agents and Immigration and Customs Enforcement, an agency that many Democrats have called to abolish. \"The Democrat agenda of open borders is morally reprehensible,\" Trump said. \"It's the greatest betrayal of the American middle class, and frankly American life, our country has seen as a whole.\" Trump did point to one of the most tangible and far-reaching accomplishments he has had as president \u2014 filling the federal courts with conservative judges who may reshape American jurisprudence for decades. Most notably, there are the two Supreme Court justices he successfully appointed, Neil Gorsuch and Brett Kavanaugh. Trump reflected on Kavanaugh's testy confirmation amid allegations of sexual assault when he was a teenager, which Kavanaugh denied, as evidence the Democrats would stymie every move he made. \"Just imagine what this angry, left-wing mob would do if they were in charge of this country,\" Trump mused. A massive downpour hit as attendees were lining up for President Trump's campaign rally at the Amway Center in Orlando, Fla. It didn't deter many people, but did cause muddy conditions outside the arena.\n                \n                    \n                    Tamara Keith/NPR\n                    \n                \nhide caption Defining the opponent-to-be Along with Vice President Pence's introduction, Trump's remarks hammered home what they believe is their most persuasive issue \u2014 convince voters that Democrats' far-reaching progressive agenda is akin to socialism and should be roundly rejected. \"A vote for any Democrat in 2020 is a vote for the rise of radical socialism and the destruction of the American dream,\" Trump proclaimed. Trump didn't mention most of the 23 men and women seeking the Democratic nomination, but two who have led most early polls did get a passing mention. When talking about the Obama administration and its approach to Chinese trade policy, he slammed both the former president and former Vice President Joe Biden and later referred to Biden by his personalized nickname, \"Sleepy Joe.\" Trump also assailed \"crazy\" Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders and his \"socialist takeover of government health care.\" Sanders supports a \"Medicare for All\" program that would replace the private health insurance industry. Playing to the crowd Trump polled the audience about whether he should keep the \"Make America Great Again\" slogan, now famously adorned on most of the red hats that peppered the arena, or switch to \"Keep America Great,\" given that he believes he has accomplished much of what he set out to do in order to return the country to what he sees as \"greatness.\" The Amway Center was packed to its capacity of 20,000 \u2014 which Trump campaign manager Brad Parscale said was their largest indoor rally ever \u2014 with many people lining up hours ahead of time to get a seat, even withstanding heavy rains. Supporters like Gene Huber of West Palm Beach, Fla., were undeterred by inclement weather. He was in line to attend his 16th rally after going up on stage to give Trump a hug at the first rally after his inauguration, which served as another unofficial launch for his bid for a second term back in February 2017. Gene Huber of West Palm Beach, Fla., was attending his 16th Trump rally and wore a shirt depicting one rally he attended where President Trump called him up on stage and gave him a hug. He says he's writing a book about Trump.\n                \n                    \n                    Tamara Keith/NPR\n                    \n                \nhide caption \"Every rally's the same, but it's better accomplishments that he does for us\" that Trump lays out each time, Huber said. Karen Colby, who had attended a 2016 campaign rally, also stayed in the queue to see the president. \"This is more exciting because he's going to announce his reelection. It's historic,\" she said. \"He's done things nobody else has. He's honored his word. That means a lot.\"",

Updated at 10:40 a.m. ET On the day of his self-declared presidential campaign kickoff, President Trump is threatening to deport \"millions\" of immigrants in the United States illegally beginning \"next week.\" But what's known is far less definitive. The administration is predicting that with increased help from Mexico, it will have more bed space at detention centers. So the administration is planning to prioritize going after recent arrivals who have not been showing up to court, according to an adviser to the Department of Homeland Security. The enforcement action is not for people who have been in the country long term but is more focused on the people who just got to the country and skipped court dates. Jessica Vaughan, director of policy studies for the Center for Immigration Studies, who is in regular discussions with the administration, said people have been led to believe that if they arrive with a child, they will be able to stay. She said that won't be the case under this new plan. \"It's not like the president just woke up and thought of this idea,\" Vaughan said. \"They've been laying the groundwork for this already. What they've been doing has not been successful, so they're going to be trying something new. And they're going to be focused on people who already have a final order of removal. And they also want people to understand that family cases are on the table.\" There are more than 1 million immigrants in the U.S. with orders of deportation who have not been removed, according to an administration official who was not authorized to speak publicly about the policy, noting that \"countless\" numbers of people are skipping court hearings and \"absconding from federal proceedings.\" Referring to them as \"runaway aliens,\" this official said that they \"lodge phony asylum claims only to be no-shows at court and are ordered removed in absentia.\" The official added: \"There are more than 1 million illegal aliens who have been issued final deportation orders by federal judges yet remain at large in the country. These judicial removal orders were secured at great time and expense, and yet illegal aliens not only refuse to appear in court, they often obtain fraudulent identities, collect federal welfare, and illegally work in the United States. Enforcing these final judicial orders is a top priority for Immigration and Customs Enforcement \u2014 willful defiance of our laws and the defrauding of the American People with fraudulent asylum claims will not be tolerated.\" Trump administration officials believe threats and potential action could serve as a deterrent. Others have doubts, especially as the number of border apprehensions have increased despite the administration's hard-line family separation policy that has since been scaled back. Immigration advocates warn that families could again be separated in the kind of broad, hard-line action the president seems to be promising. ICE officials have been stretched dealing with increased border crossers, and the administration is hoping that the deal with Mexico to ramp up enforcement at its southern border will have a domino effect that will free up bed space in detention centers and could allow ICE agents to do more interior enforcement. Trump is holding a rally Tuesday night in Orlando, Fla., a key state in his reelection hopes. The president used immigration as a key cultural touchstone during the 2016 election to fire up his base of supporters.",

The far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) party has lost its first mayoral contest, handing embattled Chancellor Angela Merkel's center-right Christian Democratic Union (CDU) a solid victory. In the small eastern town of Goerlitz, near the border with Poland, Octavian Ursu, a 51-year-old Romanian immigrant and classical musician, easily won Sunday's runoff vote against AfD's Sebastian Wippel, 36, who stood on an anti-immigrant platform. Ursu won by 55.1% to Wippel's 44.9%, according to The Associated Press. Goerlitz lies in the heart of a region in eastern Germany seen as a stronghold of support for the far-right party. In the first round of voting on May 26, Wippel won 36.4% to Ursu's 30.3%. The election has been closely watched as a possible bellwether for Sept. 1 German state elections in Saxony, where Goerlitz is located, and neighboring Brandenburg. Despite Sunday's outcome in Goerlitz, AfD remains neck-and-neck with the CDU in Saxony and the party is polling ahead of the CDU's ally, the center-left Social Democrats (SPD), in the state of Brandenburg.

A victorious Ursu said Goerlitz, a town of just 56,000 that is known for the Hollywood movies shot there, such as The Grand Budapest Hotel and Inglourious Basterds, had refused to give in to his opponent's nativist message. \"[I]t is not about two candidates but the orientation of this town to the outside world and that we remain an open society and do not isolate ourselves,\" Ursu was quoted by Reuters as saying. In an open letter published ahead of the election, German and international actors, directors and producers urged the town's residents not to \"give in to hate, hostility strife and marginalization.\"",

Voters in Israel will go the polls for the second time this year after Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu missed a midnight deadline to form a coalition government. The Israeli parliament, prompted by Netanyahu, has voted to hold new elections Sept. 17. The move comes after elections were just held in April and appeared to give Netanyahu a fourth consecutive term in office. The Knesset voted 74-45, on a bill sponsored by Netanyahu's Likud party, to dissolve itself and call for new elections. Had Netanyahu not prompted the call for new elections, Israel's ceremonial president could have chosen someone else to try to form a government. The call for new elections is a surprising turn of events for Netanyahu who is widely considered Israel's most powerful politician. As NPR's Daniel Estrin reported on All Things Considered, it is unprecedented to have new balloting scheduled just a month after the previous elections. Estrin said there were two sticking points keeping Netanyahu from forming a majority government: \"The official reason given was that former Defense Minister Avigdor Lieberman had very high conditions. He demanded a mandatory military draft for Orthodox Jews and ultra-orthodox parties refused that. \"But the bigger picture here is that Netanyahu is facing legal troubles. That is his chief concern. And by the end of this year he is going to be facing likely corruption charges. So he had been trying to build a coalition that would grant him immunity from prosecution while he's in office. So things got complicated because he was trying to weave in his immunity into the deals he was trying to make with these parties.\" Estrin also reported that the new elections could delay the political components of a peace plan, such as borders and the issue of a Palestinian state, that is being fashioned in the White House by President Trump's advisor and son-in-law, Jared Kushner. Netanyahu is months away from being Israel's longest-serving prime minister, having held the job for one term in the 1990s and for the last decade.",

            "article_content": "Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu did not meet Wednesday's deadline to put together a governing majority, so the country's parliament voted to set new elections for Sept. 17.  ARI SHAPIRO, HOST: Israel is headed for new elections. This comes just after elections last month that appeared to give Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu a fourth consecutive term. Netanyahu has not been able to put together a governing majority by today's deadline, so the Parliament has met and voted to set elections for September 17. NPR's Daniel Estrin is in Jerusalem and joins us with the latest. Hi, Daniel. DANIEL ESTRIN, BYLINE: Hi, Ari. SHAPIRO: So just last month, it seemed like Netanyahu was the clear winner. How did this happen? ESTRIN: Yeah, this is a really surprising situation. I mean, Netanyahu has been in power for a decade. He is Israel's most powerful politician. At least we thought he was. And he just won reelection last month. But he had to form a governing coalition, and he reached a deadlock. He couldn't get this one final party onboard for a majority. His deadline was midnight tonight, and that deadline passed. And technically another lawmaker could be tapped to try to form the coalition and be prime minister. But that's something Netanyahu does not want to see happening, so his party pushed through a very quick vote in Parliament. And new elections are set. And this has never happened before where elections have been set just a month after the previous ones. SHAPIRO: Why was it so hard for Netanyahu to form a governing majority? What were the sticking points? ESTRIN: Well, the official reason given was that the former defense minister, Avigdor Lieberman, had very high conditions. He demanded a mandatory military draft for ultra-Orthodox Jews, and ultra-Orthodox parties refused that. But the bigger issue here is that Netanyahu is facing legal troubles. That is his chief concern. And by the end of this year, he's going to be facing likely corruption charges. And so he had been trying to build a coalition that would grant him immunity from prosecution while he's in office. So things got complicated because he was trying to, you know, weave in his immunity into the deals he was trying to make with these parties. SHAPIRO: So given the legal peril hanging over Netanyahu's head, is there a chance that this redo of the election in September could result in him losing power? ESTRIN: Well, he's banking on himself winning just like he did last month. But you know, when you go into elections, you don't know how you're going to come out of them. Some of his supporters could abandon him this time around. They may blame him for dragging the country into elections. And you know, it was a close vote last month that - in some respects because some smaller, right-wing parties did not get enough votes in the last elections. And so Netanyahu's victory really isn't a sure thing. SHAPIRO: And here in the U.S., the White House has been working on a peace plan that they plan to unveil sometime in the coming months. Could this throw that into question? ESTRIN: Well, it could delay the political part of this peace plan, which is supposed to be dealing with, you know, the bigger issues like borders and the question of a Palestinian state. The White House already delayed unveiling that part of the plan during the last elections. An administration official says that the other part of their peace plan, which is the economic part, is moving forward despite all of this political drama in Israel. So the U.S. will still hold its economic conference in Bahrain next month to unveil its plan to shore up the Palestinian economy. The White House's peace envoy, Jason Greenblatt, has arrived in Israel today. Jared Kushner is reportedly here, too. They may be meeting Netanyahu tomorrow. And they're going to be meeting, if they do, a very different Netanyahu, a Netanyahu that used to be considered a political wizard, a magician who could kind of pull a rabbit out of his hat and solve this coalition crisis at the last minute. But now we don't see that that's happened. SHAPIRO: That's NPR's Daniel Estrin reporting some breaking news from Jerusalem on new elections scheduled for September after Netanyahu was unable to form a governing coalition. Daniel, thanks very much. ESTRIN: You're welcome. Copyright \u00a9 2019 NPR.  All rights reserved.  Visit our website terms of use and permissions pages at www.npr.org for further information.

            "article_content": "Elections to the European parliament are usually a ho-hum affair, but this year they're seen as a referendum on the EU itself. And in France \u2014 on President Emmanuel Macron and the far right.  MICHEL MARTIN, HOST: On this Memorial Day weekend, we're going to start the program in Europe because voters there are casting ballots for their representatives to the European Parliament. The election, held every five years, usually doesn't generate much interest. But this year, it is seen as a test of strength for rising populist nationalist parties across the continent. And in France, where the far-right party of Marine Le Pen is leading in the polls, the vote is also seen as a referendum on the fiercely pro-EU president, Emmanuel Macron. NPR's Eleanor Beardsley has this report from Paris. ELEANOR BEARDSLEY, BYLINE: In France, the European Parliament election feels like a rematch of the 2017 presidential race. Far-right leader Marine Le Pen has picked herself up after her humiliating defeat by Macron two years ago. She's now launching an assault on what she says Macron's vision of Europe will bring - savage capitalism with closing factories and illegal migrants pouring over insecure borders. (SOUNDBITE OF SPEECH) MARINE LE PEN: (Speaking Italian). BEARDSLEY: If you thought you heard Le Pen speaking Italian, you did. That's her at a recent rally in Milan with her political buddy, Matteo Salvini. Italy's far-right deputy prime minister invited populist leaders from across Europe for an EU-bashing party in front of Milan's Gothic cathedral. (SOUNDBITE OF SPEECH) THIERRY MARIANI: (Speaking French). BEARDSLEY: At a campaign event in Paris, a candidate from Le Pen's National Rally party, Thierry Mariani, is happy the French far-right now has plenty of company. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) MARIANI: Many countries are changing. For example, look what's happened in Italy, what's happened in Austria, and in the last three months in Spain, in Estonia, in Finland. BEARDSLEY: All countries where the far-right is part of coalition governments or has broken into the mainstream. In France, Le Pen supporters say they also relish the idea of casting a vote in rebuke of their president, Emmanuel Macron. They loathe his ideas of a United States of Europe and claim he favors the rich. Le Pen supporter Francoise Bedouet says she's joined in the recent yellow vest protests over the high cost of living. FRANCOISE BEDOUET: (Speaking French). BEARDSLEY: Everyone is sick and tired of Macron, she says. He's raised our taxes, and we aren't free to choose. It's the EU that makes our decisions. Macron has lowered some taxes affecting the working class, but it hasn't appeased yellow vest protesters. But three years of chaos over Brexit has stopped talk about leaving the EU. Instead, eurosceptic parties hope to win enough seats in the EU parliament to bring about change from within. Business professor Douglas Webber just wrote a book on political crises in the EU. He sees this as a defining moment. DOUGLAS WEBBER: Since the first elections in 1979, the Parliament has been dominated by pro-European parties. And for the first time, there is a threat of a very strong anti-European presence in the European Parliament. BEARDSLEY: In France, the pro-EU Renaissance Party has been airing ads that cast Sunday's vote in stark terms. Showing scenes of migrant boats and environmental disasters, they ask, do you want to solve immigration or be overpowered by it? Do you want to ignore climate change or act? Union or division - you decide which way Europe heads. Macron calls this an existential moment for Europe. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) PRESIDENT EMMANUEL MACRON: (Speaking French). BEARDSLEY: Going back to national borders will mean the loss of freedom for our citizens and the loss of a massive common market for our farmers and startups, he said. And only a united Europe will be able to stand up to the U.S. and China. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) CHANTELLE LIEB: (Speaking French). (APPLAUSE) BEARDSLEY: At a pro-Europe rally, retired lawyer Chantelle Lieb says, for her, the battle is personal. LIEB: I'm from a mixed family, French and German, and it's very important for me because I was raised in a very European way. BEARDSLEY: Lieb says, with the far-right gaining power, Europe is at a crossroads. LIEB: You see what is happening in Poland and all the east countries. They go after the woman with abortion rights. They go after the press, the justice system. BEARDSLEY: The stakes, she says, are high. Eleanor Beardsley, NPR News, Paris. MARTIN: And we'll hear more from Eleanor Beardsley tomorrow as the results of the EU parliamentary elections start coming in. Copyright \u00a9 2019 NPR.  All rights reserved.

And, India's prime minister has secured another five-year term.  NOEL KING, HOST: States that have been hit by natural disasters are likely to get some relief from the government. These are parts of the country that have been waiting months and, in some cases, years for help. RACHEL MARTIN, HOST: Senate lawmakers overwhelmingly passed a long-delayed disaster aid package late yesterday. The $19 billion will provide much-needed help to states that are trying to recover from a whole range of natural disasters - flooding, wildfires, hurricanes. And the deal comes after months of fighting between the president and Democrats over sending additional money to Puerto Rico, which was devastated after Hurricane Irma and Hurricane Maria hit nearly two years ago. There's another reason for the delay, though - they couldn't agree on funding for the president's border security measures. That includes the wall. This bill contains no funding for that wall. President Trump says he'll sign it anyway. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Well, we're going to get the immigration money later, according to everybody. I have to take care of my farmers with the disaster relief. KING: NPR's Domenico Montanaro is on the line. Good morning, Domenico. DOMENICO MONTANARO, BYLINE: Hey there, Noel. KING: So what's in the bill? What did the Senate manage to officially agree on? MONTANARO: Well, as you all - excuse me - as you all noted, it's $19.1 billion for disaster relief. That includes a billion dollars for Puerto Rico. That's for food stamps, housing and infrastructure. But the hang-up here had been that the president was hotly opposed to more money for Puerto Rico, and that went on for months. I mean, in the end, Democrats got exactly the amount that they wanted, passed the Senate 85 to eight, still has to pass the House. But that's really a formality, and they are expected to do so as early as today. KING: These relief bills used to be really easy bipartisan wins. This one took a long time to get passed. Was it just the president? What else was going on? MONTANARO: Well, it was the president. I mean, they are typically easy to pass. These are usually bipartisan. But again, President Trump didn't want this money for Puerto Rico, feels like the island has been mismanaged. He wanted this border wall funding. And Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer tried to put a wedge between the president and Senate Republicans. Let's take a listen to him here. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) CHUCK SCHUMER: I think it means that Republicans are learning that they're going to have to break from the president to get anything done because the president, just as he was yesterday, has been an obstructionist force. MONTANARO: Yeah. I mean, the fact is, for months, the president was against this bill. You know, I don't know that it was exactly as Schumer puts it, where you have Republicans breaking from him. But, you know, Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell, for example, was keeping this on the shelf until the president would sign off. And he finally did. KING: And this time the president - right? - said he intends to sign it despite not getting the money for his border wall. Do we have any sense of what changed in his mind? MONTANARO: You know, that's a hard thing to try to understand. But Senator Richard Shelby of Alabama, who's the chairman of the Senate Appropriations Committee, had been shepherding this and met with the president and some administration officials earlier this week and apparently got the president to commit to pursuing the increased immigration funding separately. There was lots of pressure, you know, on Republicans... KING: Yeah. MONTANARO: ...And the president. The president went to Florida Panhandle, for example, a couple months ago. And they wanted this funding passed, and the president, you know, again simply gave in after this lengthy delay. KING: NPR's Domenico Montanaro. Thanks, Domenico. MONTANARO: You're welcome. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) KING: All right. The founder of WikiLeaks, Julian Assange, is facing new charges. MARTIN: The Justice Department is charging Assange with violating the Espionage Act. This is for obtaining and publishing secret documents, which is what he's accused of doing. Assistant Attorney General John Demers told reporters that the published documents put the American military and others at risk. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) JOHN DEMERS: Documents relating to these disclosures were even found in the Osama bin Laden compound. This release made our adversaries stronger and more knowledgeable and the United States less secure. MARTIN: So that's one side. Press freedom advocates say the indictment threatens the First Amendment rights of journalists. KING: NPR's national justice correspondent Carrie Johnson has been following this story for many years. Good morning, Carrie. CARRIE JOHNSON, BYLINE: Good morning, Noel. KING: So what are these new charges? Lay them out for us. JOHNSON: These are 17 new charges under the Espionage Act, very, very serious escalation of the case against Julian Assange. The charges include conspiracy to obtain, receive and disclose national defense information, basically soliciting former Army Private Chelsea Manning to leak sensitive materials to WikiLeaks. Remember, she gave State Department cables, war logs and assessments of detainees at Guantanamo, among other things, to WikiLeaks, prompting this entire scandal to explode. KING: Well, as Rachel said, advocates for press freedom are really troubled by these charges. They say that this could set a precedent where journalists, especially those who cover national security and intelligence, could themselves end up facing these type of charges. Now, Julian Assange is not a traditional journalist, as we understand the term. So what is the concern here? JOHNSON: Assange may not be a traditional journalist, but some of the activities he's accused of in this new superseding indictment mirror things that reporters do every day asking sources to share sensitive information with them. In fact, the Reporters Committee for Freedom of the Press says these charges pose a dire threat to news-gathering. The ACLU calls them unprecedented and basically says that they could lay down a marker to put other reporters on notice inside the U.S. that they could be charged with wrongdoing. Now, to hear the Justice Department tell it, Julian Assange is different in part because he ignored warnings from the State Department, went ahead and published some of these materials with the names of the intelligence community and the State Department's confidential human sources in them. Here's Assistant Attorney General John Demers talking about that. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) DEMERS: No responsible actor, journalist or otherwise, would purposely publish the names of individuals he or she knew to be confidential human sources in war zone. JOHNSON: Now, no others - no evidence that anyone died as a result of these publications. But DOJ says all they have to prove in court is that there was a potential for serious harm to someone. KING: Assange is in the - is in prison in the U.K. right now for skipping bail. Is it likely that he's going to be extradited to the U.S.? JOHNSON: You know, these new charges in this new superseding indictment do raise a new question for me. There is an exception to the extradition treaty between the U.K. and the U.S. that talks about political offenses. It's not clear to me and to some of the lawyers with whom I've been in touch whether some of these new Espionage Act charges for publication of information could be considered political by British authorities. KING: Carrie, before I let you go, let me just switch gears here quickly. Last night, we learned that President Trump has given Attorney General William Barr new powers to review the investigation into the Trump campaign's ties to Russia. What is this about? JOHNSON: This is all about investigating the investigators who were looking into President Trump's campaign in 2016. Remember, Attorney General Bill Barr raised a firestorm when he said he believed there was spying on the Trump campaign even though the FBI says it didn't think it did anything wrong in that era. Now Bill Barr has appointed a U.S. attorney to look into this. The president has given Bill Barr the power to decide what information becomes public or not. Noel, Adam King (ph), the chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, says this is weaponizing intelligence information, and he calls it un-American. Some former CIA veterans are raising questions about whether the attorney general could selectively disclose some of this government - some of these government secrets to try to help the president. They say there's a parallel here to the way Bill Barr handled the quotes in the Mueller report, the special counsel's report, into Russian interference in the election. KING: NPR's Carrie Johnson. Thanks, Carrie. JOHNSON: My pleasure. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) KING: All right. Now over to India, where nearly six weeks of voting in the world's biggest democracy have ended in a landslide victory. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) MARTIN: That's the sound of celebrations that happened last night, supporters of Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who has secured another five-year term. Hundreds of millions of people turned out to vote in an election that was widely seen as a referendum on Modi's Hindu nationalist politics. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) PRIME MINISTER NARENDRA MODI: (Foreign language spoken). MARTIN: That's Modi in a victory speech saying he dedicates his win to the people of India. KING: NPR's Lauren Frayer has been reporting on the election. She's on the line from Mumbai. Lauren, before we get into it, let's talk about the logistics of this election because they are staggering - 900 million people eligible to vote. LAUREN FRAYER, BYLINE: Yeah, it's amazing. And a - and around two-thirds of them did vote, so that's a really high turnout. Indian law says that no one should have to walk more than about a mile and a quarter to vote. So in Indian elections, you literally have more than a million polling stations coming to the voters rather than the other way around. And voting is all done electronically on machines the size of these small suitcases. So we saw election workers, you know, carrying these suitcases, traveling to tropical islands in the Indian Ocean, to villages in the Himalaya Mountains. Voting happened in seven stages over nearly six weeks, and the votes were just counted last night. KING: Absolutely extraordinary. What were the big issues in this campaign? FRAYER: So Modi's campaign was really about national security and religion, Hinduism. He ordered airstrikes on Pakistan in February after a suicide bombing linked to Pakistan-based militants. He offered himself during that conflict as this strong pair of hands to lead the country. He also campaigned to his hardline Hindu base. He promised to build a Hindu temple in a very incendiary spot where a mosque was turned - torn down and Muslims were killed. What Modi did not campaign on as much was the economy. When he was elected five years ago, he promised to create jobs. But unemployment is at a four-decade high. India, you know, is going to soon overtake China as the most populous country in the world. It's also getting richer? And so you've got tens of millions of young Indians joining the labor force for the first time. And here's one first time voter, an 18-year-old named Ayushi (ph). AYUSHI: I'm happy, actually. I - my family also supported Modi. And I wish they will do better than last five years and give more chance to youth and more job vacancies. FRAYER: So she's doing an internship, wondering if she'll get a job. And she thinks five more years for Modi to come through with job growth. KING: And what does this big win for Modi mean for the rest of the government in India? Just quickly. FRAYER: So it means Modi's Hindu Nationalist Party will able - will be able to rule alone. It won't have to have coalition partners. It also means Modi's 2014 victory wasn't a one-off. His brand of Hindu nationalist, populist politics is really here to stay. You know, India was created 70-plus years ago as a secular, pluralistic democracy. Modi last night called secularism an old fad. He wants to bring the country's majority-Hindu faith into politics in unprecedented ways. KING: NPR's Lauren Frayer in Mumbai. Thanks, Lauren. FRAYER: You're welcome.

Democratic presidential candidate Juli\u00e1n Castro has a plan to change immigration policy in the U.S. The former Housing and Urban Development secretary wants to address immigrant detention, family reunification and the immigration court system. In stark contrast to current policy, he also wants to decriminalize crossing the border illegally, a plan he outlined in a Medium post in April. \"For a long time in this country we actually did not treat crossing the border as a criminal act. We treated it as a civil violation,\" Castro told NPR. \"A lot of the problems that we see in the system today flared up after we started treating it as a criminal offense.\" President Trump has taken a hard line on illegal immigration, declaring a national emergency at the southern border. Last week, he proposed a dramatic change to the legal immigration system to prioritize certain job skills over people seeking asylum or those who have relatives in the U.S. Castro disagrees with that approach. Asked whether the Democratic Party and his plan specifically might be too far left for even the Democratic electorate, Castro insists he is \"on the right path.\" \"I don't care first about what the party approach is; what I care about is getting this right for human beings,\" Castro said. Castro spoke with Morning Edition as part of the show's Opening Arguments conversations, exploring the presidential candidates' core messages. On his proposed shift away from detention of migrants What it means is that we're not going to separate little children from their families ... we're not going to routinely put people in detention. Now if somebody has committed a crime, then of course you're still going to sometimes have the ability to detain somebody. But let's just say a mom that has come here with her little baby, I would not incarcerate those folks. I would not treat them as criminals. ... So we actually have ways that have been established to ensure that people actually return for their court dates, because a lot of people ask: \"... if you just let these folks go, aren't they going to go off and never return for their court date?\" Well, actually, people recognize that they have a responsibility. On President Trump's proposed \"merit-based\" immigration system I disagree with the president on this. First of all, I'd ask folks to think about what we consider a \"skilled\" job today. Do you think that you could go and spend 10 hours picking a crop in the fields of California? Do you think that you could spend 10 hours in 102 degrees, underneath the blaring sun on a roof in Texas? That is skilled labor. But this merit system that the president has set up says that only certain people have merit. My grandmother came over here when she was 7 years old with her little sister in 1922 from Mexico with nothing. And they came over because their parents had died. I don't know that she ever would've made it in if we use the rules that this president wants to use. And yet two generations later, one of her grandsons is a congressman and the other is a candidate for president of the United States. On whether it's worth reaching out to the other side in the current political environment I think it's always worth reaching out to the other side. It's always worth trying. ... At the same time I watched [Senate Majority Leader] Mitch McConnell over the eight years that President Obama was in office do everything that he could to try and stop any kind of successes for President Obama. And so I'm not naive. If the choice is between universal health care or fixing our broken immigration system or upholding a 60-vote filibuster rule that is nowhere in the Constitution, I'm going to choose actually making progress for the American people. I do believe that being in public office is all about making choices. And if I'm president, I would steer this nation in a direction where we embrace progressive values.

            "article_content": "Immigration officials have been under fire for months as five children have died after being apprehended crossing the U.S.-Mexico border. Officials say they need more resources to address the influx.  AUDIE CORNISH, HOST: NPR's Joel Rose has been covering this story, including the government's response. He's in the studio now. Welcome, Joel. JOEL ROSE, BYLINE: Hi, Audie. CORNISH: So we just heard there from the ACLU. Border Patrol obviously has been under fire for months because of the deaths of these five migrant children. Has anything changed since December? ROSE: Well, I should say first of all that we did ask the Department of Homeland Security for comment on that ACLU complaint - did not hear back from them. But officials at Customs and Border Protection really were shaken by these deaths. Before December, no child had died in CBP custody in over a decade. They really have expanded. They have expanded the medical response. Many of the Border Patrol stations are now staffed 24 hours a day with medical staff, which was not the case before. And Border Patrol agents are making a lot of trips to the hospital with sick children up and down the Southwest border - nearly 70 kids a day since December, they say. But immigration officials say it's just hard to keep up with the sheer numbers here. It's putting a huge strain on resources, and they're asking Congress for billions of additional dollars to deal with it. CORNISH: In the meantime, what more have you learned in your reporting about the death of Carlos Hernandez Vasquez? ROSE: Well, a couple of things. One thing that really stands out is that Carlos Hernandez Vasquez died in a Border Patrol station. The previous migrant children who died were taken to the hospital first; Hernandez Vasquez was not even though immigration authorities clearly knew that he was sick. He was diagnosed with the flu by a nurse practitioner. On the same day, Customs and Border Protection moved him to a different Border Patrol station where they could separate him from the other migrants to stop the spread of the flu. Even Health and Human Services officials were concerned about how ill he was. This is the agency that's responsible for long-term care of unaccompanied children. And HHS decided that Hernandez Vasquez could not be flown to a shelter in Florida because of his illness. So in retrospect, critics say it's hard to see why they did not take him to the hospital. CORNISH: Do you think that this case is going to spur new changes to procedure or to policy regarding migrant care? ROSE: Investigations into this latest migrant death are still ongoing. The FBI, local police, CBP all have their own investigations, which may eventually shed some more light on what exactly went wrong here. But I think we're already hearing calls for these agencies to just follow the law and hand over migrant children to Health and Human Services within 72 hours as they are supposed to do. For their part, the agencies say they're trying to comply, but they need more resources. Not only are these Border Patrol stations overwhelmed, but the migrant shelters that are overseen by HHS are also near capacity. CORNISH: One more thing - today the president appointed an immigration hard-liner, Ken Cuccinelli, to a post inside the Homeland Security Department. How could this affect immigration policy? ROSE: Right. This is the former attorney general of Virginia who ran for governor on a hard-line immigration platform a few years ago. He's already been a White House adviser on immigration. He has advocated for sending more troops to the border and stopping the migrant caravans that were a big story last year. Now Cuccinelli is going to have a formal role inside the Department of Homeland Security. To me, this shows that President Trump is doubling down on his crackdown on immigrants that is likely to be a central focus of his 2020 reelection campaign. Though of course, as immigrant advocates point out, that strategy seems to have backfired, at least in part, when Republicans lost the House in last year's midterm elections.

Beto O'Rourke campaigns in a living room on the south side of Des Moines, Iowa. He held six house parties in one day on April 6. The Iowa caucuses are still nine months away, and with at least 20 Democrats either considering a run or officially declared, many of them are looking for ways to stand out in the crowded field. One tried-and-true way: show up in voters' homes. The house party has a long tradition in the presidential primary politicking of the two early states of Iowa and New Hampshire, where locals open their doors to let aspiring presidents audition in their living rooms. It's a staple of the early campaign, when many candidates can't pack larger venues. \"It's pretty surreal that you can have a candidate running for president in your living room,\" says Liz Adelman, who recently hosted Sen. Kamala Harris, D-Calif., at her Des Moines, Iowa, home. Adelman is originally from outside Washington, D.C., and has lived in Iowa for about 10 years. \"We've done this before, so I kind of knew the drill of what to expect in terms of food and put everything in cabinets to hide,\" says Adelman, who works in public relations, with a laugh. \"It doesn't normally look this clean.\" Liz Adelman (left) hosted presidential candidate Sen.

Kamala Harris, D-Calif., in her Des Moines home. Adelman says it's surreal to host a candidate in her living room. Adelman was not endorsing Harris at the house party she hosted for the candidate (although Harris is among Adelman's favorite candidates). Harris was there talking about the state chapter of Emerge America and emphasizing the importance of women running for office. \"I am running for president of the United States and I am a candidate and I would love to have everybody's support, so I'm going to get that out of the way,\" Harris told the crowd standing on a landing at the base of Adelman's staircase. Enjoying his rise in fame last week, Pete Buttigieg, mayor of South Bend, Ind., drew a crowd estimated at 1,600 on Tuesday in Des Moines. The last time he was in Des Moines was February, when he was in a living room with a couple of dozen potential caucusgoers. South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg (second from right) campaigns at a house party in suburban Des Moines on Feb. 9, soon after announcing he was considering a run for the Democratic presidential nomination. Two months later, Buttigieg drew a crowd of nearly 1,600 in Des Moines.\n                \n                    \n                    Clay Masters/Iowa Public Radio\n                    \n                \nhide caption South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg (second from right) campaigns at a house party in suburban Des Moines on Feb. 9, soon after announcing he was considering a run for the Democratic presidential nomination. Two months later, Buttigieg drew a crowd of nearly 1,600 in Des Moines. Some house parties have a guest list, while others are more of a town hall at which anyone can show up and ask questions. This month, candidate Beto O'Rourke visited six houses in Des Moines on one Saturday. Homeowner Nathan Blake told the crowd that he and his family had just moved in and that hosting a presidential candidate hurried their unpacking. \"[I'm] really happy that all of you are here, whether you're a supporter of Beto or, just as I've been saying this week, Beto-curious,\" Blake told the crowd in his living room, where many were sitting cross-legged on the floor. \"We only have 10 months to decide.\" During the question-and-answer portion of O'Rourke's south-side Des Moines house party, Dante Powell asked him what he would do as president to ease tensions between African Americans and law enforcement. \"I was not prepared for how honest he was,\" Powell says. \"So, I appreciated very much him going into detail the way he did and owning the inherent racism in the systems that I was asking about.\" Powell says he likes O'Rourke, but he's far from picking a favorite, a feeling shared by many Iowa Democrats trying to grapple with nearly 20 declared presidential candidates. A bed for weary candidates House parties aren't just for Iowa's big population centers. \"We have to resort to every trick that we can,\" says Kurt Meyer. He lives in the small north Iowa town of Mona and is the chair of the Tri-County Democrats. Meyer has been hosting candidates for years. This cycle, Meyer has even had a couple of Democratic candidates spend the night at his house after they stumped in his living room. \"We have accommodations to put you up for the night, and that affords people an opportunity to not only to get to know the candidate but for us to get to know the candidate in a more informal setting,\" Meyer says. With nice weather in the months ahead, expect even more Iowans to open their homes to candidates trying to become the next president.",

President Trump is trying to ratchet up public pressure on congressional Democrats to bend to his administration's will on immigration, but the House majority is dismissing new White House proposals to discourage the surge of migrants at the U.S.-Mexico border. In a Wednesday morning tweet, the president called on Congress to return early from the scheduled two-week April recess to pass a border bill. Democrats in Congress must return from their Vacations and change the Immigration Laws, or the Border, despite the great job being done by Border Patrol, will only get worse. Big sections of Wall now being built! Administration officials last week told White House reporters that they want Congress to act to change immigration laws affecting how families are held in detention, the processing of unaccompanied minors at the border, and the criteria migrants can use to claim asylum. The collective goal is to discourage more migrants from attempting to cross the border and to make it easier to hold them in detention if they do. Drew Hammill, a spokesman for Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., told NPR the White House's ideas are \"an anti-immigrant wish list that does nothing to keep our country safer and erodes our values as a nation of immigrants.\" Last week, the speaker defended congressional action on the border, noting the bipartisan spending deal reached in February and signed by the president included significant border resources, including $1.375 billion in funding to build barriers along the U.S.-Mexico border. \"There is money there for increased judges to adjudicate the cases more quickly; there is funding there for humanitarian assistance for the people coming in; there is money for repairs and for physical necessities that may be there; and there is funding to send to countries of the Northern Triangle [Guatemala, Honduras, and El Salvador] to try to alleviate the problem before it reaches our shores,\" Pelosi told reporters. House Democrats do plan to act on immigration this year, but on a revamped Dream Act to provide legal status and a path to citizenship for up to 3.6 million people who were brought to the U.S. as children and reside in the country illegally or who are in legal limbo through the Obama-era Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program that is being challenged in court. For two years, President Trump has offered varying degrees of support for the  Dream Act and taken it on and off the table in sporadic negotiations on immigration that have yet to result in any tangible immigration proposal that can pass both chambers of Congress and earn his signature. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., who is up for reelection in 2020, told reporters last week that he was open to a new round of immigration talks. \"I think it's way past time, on both sides, that we sit down together and see what we could agree to to improve the situation, not only border security, but also the asylum laws that are very challenging when you are confronted with this onslaught of people,\" he said. He did not elaborate on what could clear a 60-vote hurdle in the Senate. Efforts to pass comprehensive immigration legislation have failed under the previous two administrations, and it is far less likely to succeed under Trump as the two parties move further apart on the policies needed as the 2020 elections near. The president and his allies have always seen his hard-line stance on immigrants and immigration as a reason for his 2016 victory and a key to bolstering his prospects for reelection. Meanwhile, Democrats see opposition to Trump's immigration policies as a reason for their own successes in the 2018 midterms and believe they can campaign on the issue with minority voters heading into 2020.

On Saturday, Trump and Jimmy Carter spoke for the first time, discussing China. A version of this story was first posted by member station WABE. President Trump called former President Jimmy Carter for the first time this weekend. Carter revealed that news during his regular Sunday school lesson at his home church, Maranatha Baptist Church in Plains, Georgia, on Sunday morning. Earlier this year, Carter sent Trump a letter with some advice about managing the U.S.-China relationship. Carter oversaw the normalization of diplomatic relations between the two countries 40 years ago. On Saturday evening, Trump called Carter to talk about it. It was the first time they'd spoken, Carter said. He said Trump told him that he is particularly concerned about how China is \"getting ahead of us.\" Carter said he agreed with Trump on this issue. \"And do you know why?\" Carter said. \"I normalized diplomatic relations with China in 1979. Since 1979, do you know how many times China has been at war with anybody? None. And we have stayed at war,\" he said. (China and Vietnam actually fought a brief border war in early 1979, weeks after U.S. relations with China were normalized.) Carter said the United States is \"the most warlike nation in the history of the world\" due to a desire to impose American values on other countries, and he suggested that China is investing its resources into projects such as high-speed railroads instead of defense spending. \"How many miles of high-speed railroad do we have in this country?\" Zero, the congregation answered. \"We have wasted, I think, $3 trillion,\" Carter said, referring to American military spending. \"China has not wasted a single penny on war, and that's why they're ahead of us. In almost every way. \"And I think the difference is if you take $3 trillion and put it in American infrastructure, you'd probably have $2 trillion left over. We'd have high-speed railroad. We'd have bridges that aren't collapsing. We'd have roads that are maintained properly. Our education system would be as good as that of, say, South Korea or Hong Kong. \"I wasn't comparing my country adversely to China,\" Carter qualified. \"I was just pointing that out because I happened to get a phone call last night.\" The former president said he understands that Trump is worried about China surpassing the U.S. as the world's top economic superpower. \"I don't really fear that time, but it bothers President Trump, and I don't know why. I'm not criticizing him \u2014 this morning,\" Carter said to laughs from the audience. The White House confirmed the conversation in a statement released Monday. \"President Jimmy Carter wrote President Trump a beautiful letter about the current negotiations with China and on Saturday they had a very good telephone conversation about President Trump's stance on trade with China and numerous other topics,\" said the statement, which wasn't attributed to a spokesperson. Much of Carter's Palm Sunday lesson was focused on peace and kindness and was given before an audience that was mostly composed of visitors, many of whom had lined up overnight for the service. Last month, Carter became the nation's longest-living president.",

An hour after sunrise in India on Thursday, the world's largest exercise of democracy got underway. That's when polls opened on the first day of voting in Indian elections. A nationwide election in India is a massive undertaking \u2014 with a population of 1.3 billion and nearly 900 million eligible voters. This year, there are 543 parliamentary seats up for grabs, including that of Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who's running for a second term. Balloting is no single-day affair. Poll workers must reach voters from the Himalayas to tropical islands in the Indian Ocean. So voting is done in seven stages, over more than five weeks \u2014 through May 19. Then votes will be counted on May 23. Who is running? Modi is the front-runner. He and his ruling Bharatiya Janata Party are running for another five-year term. The BJP is a Hindu nationalist party that's brought India's majority Hindu faith into politics and public life in unprecedented ways. Under the BJP, many Indian states have banned beef, because cows are sacred to Hindus. They've revised school textbooks and changed the names of Indian cities with Muslim-sounding names. Modi has campaigned as a pro-business, anti-corruption candidate, and he sought to portray himself as a safe pair of hands during recent violence with neighboring Pakistan. Modi's main challenger is India's main opposition party, the Congress party, and its leader Rahul Gandhi (no relation to India's freedom leader Mahatma Gandhi). Congress is a secular, socialist party that has pledged to protect India's minorities and improve life for the poor. It's a dynastic party; Gandhi's great-grandfather, Jawaharlal Nehru, was India's first prime minister. The party has been run by his descendants ever since, and it has dominated Indian politics until only recently. If Modi wins and serves a full second term, it would be the longest stretch of non-Congress rule since India's independence from Britain in 1947. What are the issues? Many voters see this election as a referendum on Modi's past five years in office. India's economy is one of the fastest-growing in the world. But unemployment has hit a four-decade high. Crop prices are low, which means food is cheap. But it also means farmers' profits are meager, and they've been protesting in the streets. Voters also care about national security, after India and its archrival Pakistan \u2014 both nuclear powers \u2014 exchanged airstrikes this winter. How does voting work? Indian law says no one should have to travel more than 2 kilometers (about 1.25 miles) to vote. So poll workers have fanned out across the country, setting up polling stations wherever there's even a tiny settlement. They trek through the jungle to bring voting machines to a man who lives alone in a lion-infested forest in the western state of Gujarat, and climb to nearly 15,000 feet above sea level to set up a polling station for 12 residents of a village in the northern province of Leh. All voting is done by electronic voting machine, or EVM. The tabletop machine looks like a miniature piano keyboard, with buttons next to a list of political parties and also symbols \u2014 for those voters who might not be able to read. The machines fit into small suitcases, which poll workers have carried across glaciers and through deserts \u2014 even hoisting them overhead as they ford rivers to reach voters. Some poll workers have to take helicopters to reach remote settlements of voters. By the numbers 1 in 8: Proportion of human beings eligible to vote in Indian elections 543: Seats at stake in the lower house of India's parliament 272: Seats any party needs, outright or by coalition, to form a government and choose India's next prime minister 2,293: Political parties, national and local, contesting Indian elections 8,000+: Candidates running for Indian parliament 2: Anglo-Indian seats in India's parliament. Those are seats reserved for members of the British community who stayed behind in India after the end of colonial rule. 1 million: Polling stations set up across India 11 million: Government employees deployed to oversee Indian voting 3.9 million: Electronic voting machines (EVMs) in use 1991: Year EVMs were introduced in India At least $345 million: Value of cash, drugs, alcohol and goods confiscated so far from politicians attempting to bribe voters with gifts 15,256: Feet in elevation above sea level of India's highest-altitude polling station in Tashigang, a Buddhist settlement near the Chinese border 66 percent: Voter turnout for the last Indian elections, in 2014 $5 billion: Cost of 2014 elections; this year is expected to exceed that 300 million: Estimated number of Indians on Facebook. This is the social media site's largest market. The Indian government has expressed concern that fake news, spread on Facebook and the phone messaging app WhatsApp, could sway voters. Facebook says some 40 million rupees (half a million dollars) has been spent on political ads in India so far.",

Here she testifies on Capitol Hill on March 6. Updated at 11:17 p.m. ET Secretary of Homeland Security Kirstjen Nielsen is leaving her post, President Trump announced Sunday as he continues to focus on restricting border crossings amid a recent surge. Nielsen had recently warned a congressional panel of a \"catastrophe\" on the southern border after the number of crossings hit a 10-year high. Trump confirmed the news in a tweet, saying, \"I would like to thank her for her service.\" Trump said Kevin McAleenan, the current commissioner of U.S. Customs and Border Protection, would serve as acting secretary. Nielsen said Sunday night that she will stay on through Wednesday. The change at the top comes with other uncertainty over management at the Department of Homeland Security. The president on Friday dropped his nominee to lead Immigration and Customs Enforcement, Ronald Vitiello, telling reporters, \"We want to go in a tougher direction.\" Secretary of Homeland Security Kirstjen Nielsen will be leaving her position, and I would like to thank her for her service.... Trump's own response to the situation at the border in recent days has been frenetic. First, he threatened to close the southern border as soon as last week. Then, he backed off that threat and issued a new one, saying he would put hefty tariffs on cars made in Mexico if the country did not do more to stop the flow of migrants as well as drugs coming north. He gave Mexico a \"one-year warning.\" Often the primary person working to turn Trump's harsh immigration rhetoric into policy, Nielsen was under intense scrutiny. As recently as March, she faced tough questioning from House Democrats over the treatment of migrants, especially children, at the southern border. Nielsen is Trump's second secretary of homeland security, taking over the cabinet post in December 2017 after John Kelly became White House chief of staff. Nielsen had worked as a top aide to Kelly at both DHS and the White House. Her tenure was marked throughout by tensions with Trump, who reportedly lashed out at her several times because illegal border crossings have not been stopped. Nielsen faced more public pressure after the Trump administration enacted a policy of family separation that resulted in thousands of migrant children being separated from their parents, which the president ultimately reversed. In her resignation letter posted on Twitter, Nielsen alluded to her rocky tenure. Its been an honor of a lifetime to serve with the brave men and women of @DHSgov.  I could not be prouder of and more humbled by their service, dedication, and commitment to keep our country safe from all threats and hazards. pic.twitter.com/lIQ5iqGDmF \"Despite our progress in reforming homeland security for a new age, I have determined that it is the right time for me to step aside,\" wrote Nielsen. \"I hope that the next Secretary will have the support of Congress and the courts in fixing the laws that have impeded our ability to fully secure America's borders and have contributed to discord in our nation's discourse.\" Democrats, who have been critical of Nielsen's actions at DHS throughout her time there, said her departure showed that Trump's immigration policy was too extreme. \"When even the most radical voices in the administration aren't radical enough for President Trump, you know he's completely lost touch with the American people,\" said Senate minority leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y. \"Through lies, misdirection and rationalizations, Nielsen defended the indefensible and presided over policies, including family separation, that will live in infamy,\" Frank Sharry, executive director of America's Voice, a pro-immigration group, said in a statement. Sharry added that he does not expect the administration to back off its hardline approach to immigration policy. \"While she will not be missed, we have no illusions that her replacement will usher in a brighter day at DHS.\" Facing a \"breaking point\" The number of migrants apprehended at the border jumped to more than 100,000 last month, the biggest monthly total in more than a decade. As the weather warms up, immigration authorities warn that the flow of migrants crossing the border will continue to grow, possibly reaching as high as 150,000 per month. While illegal border crossings are still far below the highs seen two decades ago, administration officials have warned that the current surge has led to a humanitarian crisis and put the immigration system at a \"breaking point.\" That's because the majority of migrants arriving now are families and children fleeing violence and poverty in Central America. Unlike individual migrants looking for work, many of these migrants are seeking asylum and must be allowed to pursue their claims in immigration court. Overwhelmed by the influx, Customs and Border Protection has begun releasing more families with a notice to appear in immigration court instead of first handing them over to Immigration and Customs Enforcement for processing and detention. Nielsen tried to shift resources within her department to help with processing the migrants and last week appointed a Border Patrol veteran to serve as coordinator of the department's response to the \"border crisis.\" \"I want to be clear with the American people: there is an unprecedented emergency at the southern border, and DHS is leading a true government-wide emergency response,\" Nielsen said in a statement announcing the move. Nielsen also joined President Trump in calling on Congress to close what they call \"loopholes\" in immigration law to make it easier to detain and deport migrant families and kids. On defense with Trump \u2014 and for him Throughout her tenure, Trump blamed Nielsen for an inability to get Congress to fully fund a wall on the southern U.S. border with Mexico, even though she was not involved in the spending deal Trump reached with congressional leaders earlier in 2018. The border wall funding question led to a stalemate that caused the longest partial government shutdown in U.S. history \u2014 with the president following through on threats not to sign critical spending bills unless he got what he deemed sufficient funding for his border wall and with congressional Democrats rejecting any legislation that would provide such funding. Trump ultimately took the highly unusual step of declaring a national emergency in order to go around Congress to secure more border wall funding, a move that Democrats are challenging in court. Democrats and immigration advocates criticized Nielsen for policies she advocated that actively sought to separate children from their parents at the border, including a protest inside a Mexican restaurant in Washington where the secretary was eating dinner last June. \"The law says if you cross between the ports of entry, you are entering without inspection and that is a crime,\" Nielsen said, defending herself in an interview with NPR's John Burnett in May 2018. \"Our policy has not changed in that if you break the law, we will refer you for prosecution,\" she added. \"What that means, however, is if you are a single adult, if you are part of a family, if you are pregnant, if you have any other condition, you're an adult and you break the law, we will refer you. Operationally what that means is we will have to separate your family.\" The administration backed away from that policy after a public outcry and in light of court rulings \u2014 just days after Nielsen had mounted a vigorous public defense of the controversial policy. Nielsen had to defend Trump on other issues, too. In January 2018, a little over a month after she was sworn in as DHS secretary, Nielsen testified to a Senate panel that she had not heard Trump describe some African nations as \"shithole countries,\" although she conceded that he had used \"tough language\" in a meeting on immigration issues that included members of Congress who insisted Trump had, in fact, used the pejorative. Months later, in response to a reporter's question, she said she \"was not aware of\" reports from U.S. intelligence agencies that concluded that the Russian government actively tried to swing the 2016 presidential election to Trump and away from Democrat Hillary Clinton. Nielsen's characterization of the foreign interference threat to U.S. elections evolved: She later said that although it continued to happen, it was not taking place with the same intensity as it had in 2016. DHS and other agencies released a statement ahead of Election Day 2018 that said the focus of foreign influence operations was on disinformation via social media platforms and less on cyberattacks aimed at stealing embarrassing information about political targets or disrupting the actual working of elections.",

            "article_content": "We go through the week in politics, including President Trump's visit Friday to the U.S.-Mexico border.  SCOTT SIMON, HOST: President Trump says the country is full. It was during his visit Friday to the U.S.-Mexico border where he again called the influx of migrants there an emergency. Trip came just day after President Trump backed away from his earlier threat to close down the southern border. This week, the country saw the unusual sight of the president in retreat. NPR's Ron Elving, senior editor and correspondent of the Washington Desk, joins us now. Ron, thanks so much for being with us. RON ELVING, BYLINE: Good to be with you, Scott. SIMON: Last week, the president said he'd close the border if Mexico didn't stop all illegal immigration. This week, it became a one-year warning. Possibility of car tariffs was raised. What happened? ELVING: The president got an earful from just about everybody about the consequences of closing the busiest international border in the world. That's $1.7 billion every day in trade, something like a million people crossing the border north and south on a daily basis. Closing it is not a realistic tactic nor a credible threat. And Scott, this new ultimatum sounds much the same. When you said a one-week deadline and then change it to 52 weeks, it sends a message that you're not serious. SIMON: Course, it wasn't the only major issue in which the president was in retreat this week. He backed off plans to vote on a Republican replacement for the Affordable Care Act - now says that that can wait until after 2020's elections. ELVING: As we said last week, there wasn't a replacement plan to vote on, nor even one in development. So this week we hear that we might see such a plan in the next year or two, but it wouldn't be voted on, as you say, until 2021. Again, this looks less like a serious negotiation on an important issue and more like a pivot to a more defensible political posture on the issue. SIMON: We do not have the Mueller report yet. Until then, we do have the Barr letter - good reading to tide us over or not. The New York Times and The Washington Post had stories this week that say some members of the Mueller team have been frustrated by the attorney general's summary of the special counsel's report, and the Justice Department subsequently defended the Barr letter. How do you read all this back and forth? ELVING: It's about controlling the information in the report and limiting access to that information. We know some redactions are going to happen. They're going to be related to protections for grand jury testimony and concerns about revealing national security information. But how much is really necessary, and who is to decide? The most disturbing thing we heard this week was that some of Mueller's own investigators provided summaries of their own - summaries that could be released, but which had been withheld along with the rest of the report. And another big development this week that didn't get enough attention - Senator Charles Grassley of Iowa, the senior Republican in the Senate, coming out to say the Mueller report should be released. Grassley is usually a backer of the president and his prerogative, so this was a pretty big deal. SIMON: Want to ask you about the jobs report yesterday - 196,000 jobs added in March, better than the very bad numbers in February. A good economy supports the Trump agenda, doesn't it? ELVING: It certainly does. It's the lifeblood of his presidency. So the president wants to keep pumping up that economy. He wants to lower interest rates, make other policy changes at the Federal Reserve. And to do that, he's appointed two men - Stephen Moore and Herman Cain - whose standing with the president is far higher than it is among economists. They are not like past board nominees from presidents of both parties, and both will face a fight for confirmation in the Senate. SIMON: NPR's Ron Elving, thank you so much for being with us.

            "article_content": "We look at how Boeing is responding to Ethiopian investigators who found that despite following all of the safety procedures provided by Boeing, the crew was unable to prevent the crash.  STEVE INSKEEP, HOST: When a passenger jet crashed in Indonesia last year, Dennis Muilenburg said what airline executives commonly say. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) DENNIS MUILENBURG: The bottom line here is the 737 Max is safe. RACHEL MARTIN, HOST: The Boeing CEO told Fox Business that pilots have the instructions they need. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) MUILENBURG: We ensure that we provide all of the information that's needed to safely fly our airplanes. MARTIN: Now, after a second crash, Muilenburg is forced to say something else. Ethiopian investigators say a 737 Max plane crashed even after pilots followed all the directions. INSKEEP: NPR's Russell Lewis covers aviation, has been following this story. Russell, good morning. RUSSELL LEWIS, BYLINE: Good morning. INSKEEP: What's the Boeing CEO saying now? LEWIS: Well, you know, we heard their tenor change yesterday, certainly - I mean, after a barrage of news coverage from that preliminary report that basically showed, in fact, that the pilots, as we say, of that second doomed flight in Ethiopia did indeed, you know, follow Boeing procedures. And even doing that, they still could not control the jet before a crash. Boeing's public statements - I mean, they definitely shifted. I mean, they put out a statement late in the day. Here's their CEO, Dennis Muilenburg. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) MUILENBURG: It's our responsibility to eliminate this risk. We own it, and we know how to do it. LEWIS: You know, and to be honest, really, that's what Boeing has been doing in the past few weeks. There have been these daily test flights out of Seattle. I've actually been following their flight profiles on a - and watching, specifically, the radar returns that show the pace and the varying speed of their flights, watching them climb and descend and how the speed changes as that plane descends rapidly. INSKEEP: Muilenburg was on one of those planes, wasn't he? LEWIS: He was. Yeah, he was on the 737 Max 7. And Boeing didn't announce it before he went on it, but he was - that they released pictures afterwards of showing him in the cockpit during that flight. INSKEEP: That would've been pretty dramatic had they said in advance, and we could've all followed it with suspense. But we do have this situation where Boeing is acknowledging responsibility, and hundreds of people have been killed. How might they be held accountable? LEWIS: Well, you know, I mean, you always see these sort of legal challenges that come out. It happens after any plane crash. But, you know, it feels different this time because I think that this is a crash that people are coming to the realization that probably shouldn't have happened. I mean, you're hearing calls from safety advocates and others who really, frankly, are asking tough and legitimate questions about why didn't Boeing ground the 737 Max jet after the first crash, the one in October in Indonesia that went down under similar circumstances. You know, now we're hearing news that the family of one-time presidential candidate Ralph Nader, whose niece Samya Stumo died in the Ethiopian Air crash - here he is speaking on NPR's All Things Considered. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED BROADCAST) RALPH NADER: The aerodynamic design should not be such that it puts unfair and preventable burden on pilots in a whole host of configurations. That's why I'm calling for a recall, not just continued grounding. INSKEEP: Of course, Nader first became famous as a consumer advocate. LEWIS: Absolutely, and this is right in his wheelhouse. INSKEEP: Well, is flight control software the only problem that Boeing has here? LEWIS: No. I mean, almost all of the attention has been focused on this anti-stall system that basically automatically lowers the plane's nose under some circumstances to prevent an aerodynamic stall. We know that something went wrong. But late yesterday, Boeing said that as part of its process, you know, its engineers found another issue that they wanted to fix. It identified another aspect of the software that they say is unrelated to the anti-stall system. They say they're going to address it as part of the software update. They call it a minor issue, and their engineers claim that they have a solution to fix it. It's probably the sort of thing that happens a lot of the time, but it's something that a lot of attention is being focused on right now. INSKEEP: Russell, thanks for talking us through this. LEWIS: You're welcome. INSKEEP: NPR's Russell Lewis. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) INSKEEP: President Trump plans to visit the Mexican border today, amid a series of shifting threats against Mexico. MARTIN: Now, the president's been dropping his threats almost as soon as he makes them. He talked about closing the border last fall and didn't. He spoke of it again in recent days, but backed off. Those threats and his latest one do reveal something significant about the president's theory of U.S. problems on the border. He says Latin American nations are deliberately sending migrants to the U.S. and that they'll stop if the punishment is severe enough. The president made this explicit in the latest version of his threat, giving Mexico one year, or its auto industry will pay. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: If the drugs don't stop - Mexico can stop them if they want - we're going to tariff the cars. The cars are very big. And if that doesn't work, we're going to close the border. But I think that'll work. That's massive numbers of dollars. INSKEEP: NPR congressional correspondent Susan Davis is following all this. Sue, good morning. SUSAN DAVIS, BYLINE: Good morning, Steve. INSKEEP: Why does the president keep making such grandiose threats and then dropping them? DAVIS: Well, there is a pattern of behavior here. You know, it was the second time just this week that the president made a big pronouncement and then had to walk it back on closing the border and then also on having a health care vote before the election... INSKEEP: Wow. DAVIS: ...Two things that his allies on Capitol Hill walked back for him. You know, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell is not one to publicly criticize the president, but when it came to the question of closing the border, he did weigh in publicly. And this is what he said earlier this week. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) MITCH MCCONNELL: We certainly have a crisis at the border. I think the president's right about that. Closing down the border would have potentially catastrophic economic impact on our country, and I would hope we would not be doing that. DAVIS: It's important to remember that about $2 billion in goods cross back and forth between the U.S.-Mexico border every day, and business groups were warning the administration that it could affect up to 5 million American jobs. INSKEEP: So the president's theory of the case is, I'm going to fix this problem if I can just make other people feel enough pain. And his own allies are telling him, actually, you would make the United States feel pain. DAVIS: It would. And also, it could threaten the president's broader goal. Remember, he's trying to renegotiate the NAFTA Free Trade Agreement with Canada and Mexico, a trading partner. And a lot of his allies said, if you do this towards Mexico, Mexico could walk away from those talks, which is a big goal for your administration. INSKEEP: Well, why is he going to the border today, and why particularly Calexico, which is on the California-Mexico border, we should note, in agricultural areas? DAVIS: So the president is going there because he wants to tout a section of wall there. It's just over two miles. The administration needs a little bit of a fact-check here because they have been promoting this trip as visiting new wall along the U.S.-Mexico border. It is not, in fact, new wall. This is essentially rehabbing what had been existing barriers there. It's now - it is what is known as bollard fencing. And it was part of a dilapidated barrier that had existed for decades. This was a project that was in the works before he became president, but it is brand new fencing. And I think for the president, who cares a lot about optics and visuals, it'll be good for him to go and stand in front of the wall and say, this is being built. INSKEEP: So we should note again that the president, in his various actions or threatened actions, is meeting resistance from his own party. Where are Democrats in all of this? DAVIS: House leaders voted this week to authorize a lawsuit against the president for his national emergency declaration. They got one step closer to fighting him in court. You know, they also tried to fight him in the Congress. They passed a resolution to try and overturn that national emergency declaration to build the wall, but he vetoed it. INSKEEP: Can House leaders alone, without the Senate - they can sue the president on their own? DAVIS: They can because the House as an institution can bring suit against the president. And the five leaders of the House voted. Of course, it fell along party lines. INSKEEP: NPR's Susan Davis. Thanks so much. DAVIS: You're welcome. INSKEEP: So how is all this being viewed on the other side of the border? Well, NPR's Carrie Kahn is there. She's in Mexico City. Good morning. CARRIE KAHN, BYLINE: Good morning. INSKEEP: How do people in Mexico respond to all of this? KAHN: Well, the president has consistently - he's just taken the same tone with - about President Trump's threats. He keeps saying he won't be provoked, and he won't be - and he will be, quote, \"prudent\" in his reaction. He wants a peaceful relationship with the U.S. So he just won't - he won't address the daily tweets. But when pushed in his press conferences, though, by reporters, he does say - the strongest thing he'll say is he thinks that closing the U.S.-Mexico border will not serve anyone's interest. INSKEEP: Well, there's also the question of countries south of Mexico. The president has said he's cutting off something like $450 million in aid to Guatemala, El Salvador and Honduras. What do you hear from those countries where I know you've done a lot of reporting over the years? KAHN: There's a lot of concern about what's happening. And that is the amount that was allocated in fiscal year 2018. So that money is still coming through the pipelines, and that will be split between the three countries. Many people just say they're just so worried, and they say it's going to be counterproductive to cut these programs that are already ongoing. I talked to this one 16-year-old boy who lives in Guatemala's capital in a particularly violent neighborhood. He's - his name is Randall Gonzalez. He was pretty articulate for a teenage boy. But he said in his program, which was granted money from USAID through Mercy Corps - and it gets about $40 million spread out over five years. They work in more than 100 communities and schools. And he was just telling me about his walk to school. I asked him what it's like - says he has to go past this gang household two doors down from him. And once he gets into school, he just breathes a sigh of relief. He says it's his sanctuary, and the programs that are there have changed his life. He says he's more confident, he's taking on leadership roles and he would never join a gang. RANDALL GONZALEZ: (Speaking Spanish). KAHN: I was asking him what he thought of the cuts by President Trump, and he said he thinks it's selfish of him to cut them off, especially just as he and his friends are making a change in their community. INSKEEP: (Speaking Spanish). That's something egoistic. That's essentially what he's saying there in Spanish? KAHN: Something - it's selfish. INSKEEP: (Laughter) Selfish - oh, my goodness. KAHN: That's his words. INSKEEP: OK. His words, of course. So this is a specific person who says he is benefiting from U.S. aid. What happens to programs like the one he benefits from if that money is cut? KAHN: That's a big question, and I talked to the head of Mercy Corps there who runs this program that Randall's in. It's the country director. His name is Marcelo Viscarra, and he said there's no big donor waiting in the wings that could help them out. And he doesn't know what he's going to do, and he said it would be heartbreaking. He just - he kind of choked up when I asked him what he would tell these schools. And he said the day he has to walk in and tell them - these recipients - would just be a heartbreaking him - heartbreaking occasion for him. MARCELO VISCARRA: I can't imagine going to those schools and tell them, hey, we have to shut everything down. We have been working so hard. INSKEEP: Although I want to try to be clear on this, Carrie Kahn, about what has and hasn't happened because, as we've noted, the president repeatedly makes threats and then backs away from them - you're saying he's cutting off this aid or saying he's going to cut off this aid in the future. But right now, the money is still flowing because it had already been allocated. Is that right? KAHN: That's right, but he has directed the State Department to cut the funds. I spoke to a congressional aide who says daily, they're asking the State Department how this is going to happen, more specifics, when this will happen. And he says so far, there haven't been any answers. And so they just - there's a lot of questions they don't know. But the president has directed the State Department to cut those funds. INSKEEP: Carrie, thanks for your good reporting - really appreciate it. KAHN: You're welcome. Thanks, Steve. INSKEEP: That's NPR's Carrie Kahn in Mexico City. Copyright \u00a9 2019 NPR.

            "article_content": "Turkey and Iran launched a joint military operation against Kurdish militants along the the mutual border between the two countries on Monday, according to an announcement from the Turkish interior minister. Turkey says the two unlikely allies \u2014 one a NATO member, the other a target of U.S. sanctions \u2014 have joined forces to target a common enemy: the Kurdistan Worker's Party or PKK, which the U.S., Turkey and others consider to be a terrorist group. \"We will announce the outcome of the operation later. We will eliminate [the terrorist PKK],\" Turkish Interior Minister Suleyman Soylu said as he announced the operation, according to the state-run Anadolu Agency. Turkey has long fought the PKK; in recent years, it has also accused the U.S. of backing the group's allies in Syria by supporting Kurdish rebels near the Turkish border. The PKK \"wants to form an independent state in Turkey's southeast,\" Durrie Bouscaren reports from Istanbul for NPR's Newscast unit. \"The Turkish military regularly attacks PKK encampments in northern Iraq,\" Bouscaren says, \"but Turkey's decision to pursue an operation with Iran appears to be a first. The two share part of Turkey's mountainous eastern border.\" Discussing the political situation in Turkey, Bouscaren says that with local elections slated for the end of this month, Turkish politicians have increased their verbal attacks on the PKK. In Iran, news about a joint operation with Turkey has been mixed. State-operated IRNA published a report about the Turkish minister's announcement, including what looks to be confirmation from Iran's deputy interior minister. But the same agency also separately reported that an anonymous source within Iran's military insisted that Iranian forces did not play any role in Turkey's military operation against the PKK on Monday.",

Beto O'Rourke may seem reminiscent of another politician who had only spent a few years in Congress before running for the White House \u2014 President Barack Obama.\n                \n                    \n                    Eric Gay/AP\n                    \n                \nhide caption The enthusiasm generated by former three-term Rep. Beto O'Rourke may seem reminiscent of another politician who had only spent a few years in Congress before running for the White House \u2014 President Barack Obama. Updated at 1:26 p.m. ET Former Texas Rep. Beto O'Rourke is running for president, hoping to build on the momentum the Democrat generated in a Senate contest last year. In a video released in the early hours of Thursday morning, with his wife Amy by his side, O'Rourke announced, \"This is a defining moment of truth for this country,\" adding what appears will be the focus of his campaign, \"the interconnected crisis in our economy, our democracy, and our climate have never been greater.\" O'Rourke is in Iowa for three days of campaigning, which includes canvassing for a Democratic state Senate candidate in an upcoming special election, running a 5K race and taping an episode of a local political podcast. He's also planning a campaign rally in El Paso on March 30. The 46-year-old mounted a stronger-than-expected challenge to Republican Sen. Ted Cruz last November, coming within 3 points of victory in the deep red state. He raised about $80 million for his bid, most of it from small-dollar donations, and amassed a nationwide grassroots following while eschewing traditional campaign methods. When asked about O'Rourke's entrance into the presidential race this morning, President Trump referred to O'Rourke's energetic hand movements in his announcement video and asked, \"Is he crazy or is that just the way he acts?\" For some, the enthusiasm the three-term congressman generated may have seemed reminiscent of another politician who had only spent a few years in Congress before running for the White House \u2014 President Barack Obama. But with just three terms in the House and losing his only statewide bid for office, it could lead others to question whether O'Rourke has the necessary experience for the nation's highest office. In a video released early Thursday morning, Beto O'Rourke, with his wife Amy by his side, announced, he is running for president. \"This is a defining moment of truth for this country,\" he said. O'Rourke's 2018 Senate campaign didn't fit the usual mold. He didn't hire traditional political consultants and pollsters, didn't take any PAC money and refused to go negative against Cruz. O'Rourke didn't just focus his campaigning on urban and suburban areas typically rich with Democratic voters \u2014 he traveled to all 254 Texas counties, committing to visit even the reddest, most rural places. Some had encouraged O'Rourke to make another run at the Senate again, challenging Republican Sen. John Cornyn in 2020, but he decided to seek higher office instead. O'Rourke had mulled a presidential run for months and took an unusual break for what appeared to be some soul-searching after his loss, taking a road trip to New Mexico, Kansas and elsewhere. \"I had to be moving, I had to be meeting people,\" O'Rourke told Oprah Winfrey in a February interview. \"It's just how I think, how I find the next step. I just truly emerged out of this by being with people.\" Some Democrats criticized that unorthodox strategy, as other top White House hopefuls were building national and state teams and making numerous early state visits. But O'Rourke's momentum seemed to be revived in a big way last month amid the debate over building a wall along the Mexican border \u2014 right along his hometown of El Paso. When President Trump held a rally in the city, which already has portions of fencing, O'Rourke held a counter-rally. Trump relished the face-off, dismissing the Democrat's crowd size (which was later estimated to be at least as big as Trump's), claiming that this \"may be the end of his presidential bid\" and that O'Rourke was simply \"a young man who's got very little going for himself except a great first name.\" The former Texas congressman pushed back on Trump's inaccurate claims that a drop in crime was due to the barriers in El Paso, telling supporters, \"We know that walls do not save lives \u2014 walls end lives.\" Statistics have shown violent crime had dropped in the city well before its wall was erected. \"We are making a stand for truth against lies and hate and ignorance and intolerance,\" O'Rourke said. \"We are going to show the country who we are. We're going to make a stand to ensure that we live up to our promise, to our potential, to our purpose as a country.\" It wasn't the first time O'Rourke generated national attention for taking on Trump. After the president attacked NFL players for kneeling during the national anthem to protest police brutality, O'Rourke responded at a town hall that he \"can think of nothing more American than to peacefully stand up, or take a knee, for your rights, any time, anywhere, in any place.\" The clip went viral. O'Rourke has the potential to occupy a unique place in the still-forming 2020 Democratic primary field. He has gotten some support from the progressive wing of the party but has centrist appeal and a history of bipartisanship too, ultimately resistant to any type of label. And he has the younger, newer face some in the party are eager for and has also gone toe-to-toe with Trump. O'Rourke was first elected to Congress in 2012, upsetting eight-term Rep. Silvestre Reyes in the Democratic primary. Before that bid, O'Rourke had served on the El Paso City Council for six years and had founded his own technology company. He's an El Paso native whose father was also involved in local Democratic politics. He attended Columbia University, where he played in a punk rock band called Foss.",

Klobuchar is among the Democratic presidential hopefuls paying attention to Wisconsin in this election cycle.\n                \n\n                    Cody Nelson/MPR News\n                    \n\nhide caption Sen. Amy Klobuchar holds an event at Shift Cyclery & Coffee Bar in Eau Claire, Wis., on Feb. 16. Klobuchar is among the Democratic presidential hopefuls paying attention to Wisconsin in this election cycle. Here's something Democrats thought they knew during the last presidential campaign: Wisconsin was safe. It was a lock for Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton. But when the votes were counted, it was a stunning upset for Republican Donald Trump. In 2020, Democrats apparently aren't taking the state for granted. Even though the first nominating contests in Iowa and New Hampshire are some 11 months away, and with Wisconsin's primary not until April 7 of next year, the campaign stops have already begun. Sen. Amy Klobuchar spoke to a packed bicycle shop and coffee house in Eau Claire two weeks ago. It was the first stop on her very first campaign trip since declaring her candidacy a week earlier. Klobuchar highlighted a family history in the Midwest, including Wisconsin. \"I do not come from money,\" the candidate began. \"My mom was a teacher. My dad was a newspaperman. My grandpa was an iron ore miner, and those relatives in Wisconsin, during the Depression, my grandpa worked in a pie shop.\" Heading to Eau Claire was a practical choice \u2014 it's not far from the Wisconsin border with Minnesota, Klobuchar's home state. Iowa is right next door as well. There was also symbolism in the form of the message it sent to Democrats everywhere that a traditionally blue battleground won't be ignored this time. Clinton's missed opportunity In the 2016 election, the Clinton campaign had a relaxed approach to Wisconsin. From the time she accepted the nomination in late July right up to Election Day, Clinton never campaigned in the state in person. She made zero visits to the state in those crucial final months, leaving that task to surrogates. Wisconsin delegates are seen during Democratic National Convention in Philadelphia in July 2016, where Hillary Clinton won the Democratic Party nomination for president.\n                \n                    \n                    Drew Angerer/Getty Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption The Democrats had pretty good reason to take that approach. After all, the last Republican to capture the state's electoral votes was President Ronald Reagan in '84 \u2014 and in 2016 the polls in the state pointed to that trend continuing. \"My poll and all 33 other polls in the state showed Clinton leading by an average of about 6 points,\" says pollster Charles Franklin of Marquette University Law School. Still, Trump's campaign treated Wisconsin like a hotly contested battleground. He made repeated visits there in the final 100 days of the campaign. At a rally in the city Eau Claire in the western, more rural part of the state, he predicted, \"In just one week we are going to win the great state of Wisconsin. And we are going to win back the White House. It's going to happen, folks.\" Ultimately, Trump carried Wisconsin by just 22,177 votes \u2014 a winning margin of less than 1 percent. It was part of a trio of upsets in previously blue states that included Michigan and Pennsylvania \u2014 giving him the margin he needed to win the White House. In December 2016, then-House Speaker Paul Ryan and Gov. Scott Walker gave President-elect Donald Trump and Vice President-elect Mike Pence Green Bay Packers jerseys in honor of winning their home state of Wisconsin.\n                \n                    \n                    Morry Gash/AP\n                    \n                \nhide caption There are a lot of things factoring into that result, of course, but pollster Charles Franklin says two things happened. Trump did well in the rural western side of the state, a more Republican area, but one that Barack Obama had managed to carry. Plus, Franklin adds, turnout in the state's largest urban area, the Democratic stronghold of Milwaukee, was significantly lower than expected. That resulted in fewer votes overall for Clinton in a big city where she needed to run up the score. Upset victories in Wisconsin, Michigan and Pennsylvania combined were key to Trump's electoral college victory. Talk to everybody, everywhere Democrats have been taking notes. Klobuchar hardly has Wisconsin to herself this time around. Another potential Democratic presidential hopeful dropped in recently, former Rep. Beto O'Rourke. At a tour of the Milwaukee Area Technical College, he said it's good that the state is getting attention. \"Wisconsin \u2014 perhaps like other parts of the country, perhaps even including where I'm from in far west Texas \u2014 too often is overlooked,\" he said. O'Rourke said he's still deciding whether to enter the presidential race. Meanwhile, Wisconsin Democratic Party Chairperson Martha Laning says she's been hearing from other candidates about early visits to the state as well. \"It sends a message to the whole nation,\" Laning tells NPR. Of the candidates, she adds that it's evident that after what happened in 2016, \"they're not going to take anything for granted and they're stopping by Wisconsin right now.\" But Laning stresses that candidate visits are only part of it. Yes, there are lessons from Clinton's absence last time, but she acknowledges that the Wisconsin Democrats need to be better at reaching voters in every part of the state \u2014 urban and rural, blue and red. Wisconsin Democratic Party Chair Martha Laning meets Wisconsin Assembly candidate Ann Groves Lloyd in April 2018 in Portage, Wis. Laning notes that the 2018 midterms were a positive sign for Democrats.\n                \n                    \n                    Morry Gash/AP\n                    \n                \nhide caption She says the 2018 midterms were a good start, as it was a very strong Democratic year in Wisconsin. They easily re-elected Democratic Sen. Tammy Baldwin, and they defeated Republican Gov. Scott Walker, who had been seeking a third term in office. Laning says the lesson of 2016's defeat is that you need to talk to voters everywhere, and if you pick up an unexpected vote here or a vote there, it can make the difference when there's another election with a razor-thin margin. Just ask President Trump.",

He'll be a college freshman in the fall and said he came to CPAC to meet like-minded conservatives and to \"show support for the president.\" Ragozzine said he likes the president's tax cuts, the conservative judges he has nominated and what he has been doing with immigration and border security. \"I think that the direction our country has been moving in for the past 10 years isn't really the direction I want it to be moving in,\" he said. \"So I want to come support the president and 'America first.' \" CPAC has evolved over the years. Always a gathering place for young activists from across the country, the emphases have changed. The Republican Party is a three-legged stool made up of national security hawks, fiscal conservatives and social values conservatives. In years when George W. Bush was president, the hawks dominated. It was a place to rally the faithful behind the \"global war on terror\" following the 9/11 attacks. With Barack Obama in the White House, this was a hive of political candidates and activists trying to figure out the way forward. And it was, for a few years, dominated by the economic libertarian strain of Ron and Rand Paul. That has faded, superseded by the culture wars \u2013 abortion, immigration and warnings about the embrace of socialism (especially among young people). Trump economic adviser Larry Kudlow told the crowd that he wanted to put socialism on trial and wanted them to \"convict it.\" The pro-Trumpism here is punctuated by the red dots of \"Make America Great Again\" hats adorning young people in the crowd and the adopting of Trump's rhetoric. \"Build the wall\" and \"America first\" weren't part of these conservative activists' lexicon before Trump. But now those words on the tips of everyone's tongues. Talk in the hallways is of the wall (and beating Democrats). There's even a fake wall, made of cardboard bricks, on display. A fake wall, made of cardboard bricks, is on display with a quote by former President Ronald Reagan that reads: \"A nation that cannot control its borders is not a nation.\"\n                \n                    \n                    Amr Alfiky/NPR\n                    \n                \nhide caption A fake wall, made of cardboard bricks, is on display with a quote by former President Ronald Reagan that reads: \"A nation that cannot control its borders is not a nation.\" Vice President Mike Pence appears before the Conservative Political Action Conference, or CPAC, on Friday.\n                \n                    \n                    Amr Alfiky/NPR\n                    \n                \nhide caption Vice President Mike Pence appears before the Conservative Political Action Conference, or CPAC, on Friday. From the audience, it's hard to miss the theme of the conference, which is in bold block letters on stage \u2014 \"What Makes America Great.\" From that stage, there's been talk of Democratic obstruction \u2014 from Elaine Chao, Trump's transportation secretary and wife of Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell. Democrats are \"invoking cloture at every step of the way,\" Chao said with seeming disbelief. She noted, \"It's not the Senate majority leader's fault.\" McConnell set a record for use of the filibuster while in the minority in attempts to block Obama's policies and judges. CPAC organizers argue that Trump has come around to many of their positions and that not everything talked about here lines up cleanly with the president. There was, for example, a panel on reducing the national debt with Republican Sen. David Perdue of Georgia. The debt has gone up under Trump, and that's something far from the core philosophy of the Tea Party, to constrain spending. Republican Sen. David Perdue, who spoke about reducing the national debt, takes a selfie with a young MAGA supporter.\n                \n                    \n                    Amr Alfiky/NPR\n                    \n                \nhide caption Republican Sen. David Perdue, who spoke about reducing the national debt, takes a selfie with a young MAGA supporter. Instead, it's the culture wars that now dominate. There was heavy talk of abortion from the main stage. Penny Nance of Concerned Women for America even proclaimed that Trump \u2013 Donald Trump \u2013 is \"the most pro-life president in my lifetime.\" (That's despite the fact that Trump used to support abortion rights and the fact that abortion rights opponents, including CWA, have heaped praise on former President George W. Bush's many anti-abortion-rights policies.) Former Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker compared abortion to taking a baby home and killing it. For Raven, the painter, his artwork was inspired by a vision of Trump's potential restoration of America. Each brush stroke seemed to be full of symbolism. One of the tiny tears in the flag, for example, is a fetus, Raven pointed out. And there's a full-length wall in the painting along the border with Mexico. It includes a big, beautiful door. What's at the heart of why Raven, born in England and raised in Spain, chose to paint this? \"When we depart from our Judeo-Christian values, the boundaries of right and wrong are lost,\" Raven said, adding, \"People have lost respect for our country. The Latin countries, especially, think they can just march into our country. Show respect. We're, like, your neighbor. We don't want a wall; we have to have a wall.\" The 8-by-16-foot painting of President Trump by artist Julian Raven is on display at the Conservative Political Action Conference in National Harbor, Md.\n                \n                    \n                    Amr Alfiky/NPR\n                    \n                \nhide caption The 8-by-16-foot painting of President Trump by artist Julian Raven is on display at the Conservative Political Action Conference in National Harbor, Md. There is little dissent here with the president \u2013 save from some concern over the \"precedent\" it might set for Trump to have declared a national emergency. And few attendees bring up the debt. CPAC, as to be expected perhaps, has amounted to not much more than a pep rally, a corralling of the troops for the president's re-election bid. That's fairly typical at partisan political conferences the year before a president runs for re-election. In fact, the hottest debate might have been one in the hallways Thursday over how to pronounce MAGA, the acronym associated with Trump's slogan, Make America Great Again. \"Why are we saying MAH-guh?\" asked one attendee to another, patting him on the back and taking a photo. \"Shouldn't it be M\u0102 [like mat]-guh?\"",

            "article_content": "At the annual Conservative Political Action Conference, faithful supporters of President Trump are gearing up for his re-election campaign.  ARI SHAPIRO, HOST: While more than a dozen Democrats are campaigning to replace President Trump, the president's own re-election argument is taking shape. As NPR's Scott Detrow reports, it is on full display this week at the annual Conservative Political Action Conference outside of Washington. SCOTT DETROW, BYLINE: You can divide President Trump's re-election pitch into three parts. Speaking to CPAC, Vice President Mike Pence marched through them. The first, despite some recent turbulence, the economy is doing really well. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) VICE PRESIDENT MIKE PENCE: Everywhere you look, confidence is back. Jobs are coming back. In a word, America is back, and we're just getting started. (APPLAUSE) DETROW: Pence said the Trump administration has a lot to do with that - executive orders cutting back Obama-era regulations, and he says... (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) PENCE: President Trump signed the largest tax cut and tax reform in American history. That's promises made and promises kept. (APPLAUSE) DETROW: The second prong - playing to Trump's base, that core group of 30 to 40 percent of voters who are there to support Trump no matter what and want to see him accomplish his more hard-line policies. That's why Pence promised to build the wall on the U.S.-Mexico border. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) PENCE: And I'll make you a promise. Before we're done, we're going to build it all. (APPLAUSE) DETROW: The third plank of the argument has been picking up steam in recent weeks as Pence, Trump and Republicans like Texas Senator Ted Cruz have watched the Democratic presidential field take form. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) TED CRUZ: They're getting more and more and more extreme on every issue. DETROW: Focusing on recent Virginia and New York bills that remove restrictions on abortions later in pregnancies, Pence argued the Democratic Party is out of step with the rest of the country. He also pointed to policies Democrats are campaigning on. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) PENCE: Under the guise of \"Medicare-for-all\" and a Green New Deal, Democrats are embracing the same tired economic theories that have impoverished nations and stifled the liberties of millions over the past century. That system is socialism. DETROW: The attacks rev up CPAC attendees like Minerva Diaz. MINERVA DIAZ: It makes it like pie in the sky the way they've put it out. Oh, you - we'll give you free this and free this. Well, you know what? Money does not grow on trees, AOC. DETROW: But Pence, Trump and other Republicans are hoping they also win over on-the-fence moderates and unhappy Republicans who may have drifted to Democrats or stayed home in 2018. He repeatedly framed the choice as one between freedom and socialism. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) PENCE: The moment America becomes a socialist country is the moment that America ceases to be America. (APPLAUSE) DETROW: Republicans are clear-eyed about all the energy on the Democratic side. Ted Cruz said his closer-than-expected Senate race against Beto O'Rourke was a warning sign. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) CRUZ: Now, what is the lesson for 2020? We are going to see the left turn out in massive numbers. They're going to flood cash. That differential is going to be the battle for the country. DETROW: Still, most of the people at CPAC are like Florida State University student Corey Adamyk. COREY ADAMYK: Well, I'm going to say this. I feel a lot more confident than I did in 2016, and we saw how that went. DETROW: President Trump comes to CPAC tomorrow to make his pitch for himself.

An Indian fighter pilot shot down and captured by Pakistan has been released in a goodwill gesture that could defuse the gravest crisis in the disputed India-Pakistan border region in years. Pakistani TV showed Wing Commander Abhinandan Varthaman dressed in civilian clothes \u2013 a navy blazer and khaki pants \u2013 walking across the Wagah border crossing into India after dark on Friday. He was accompanied by an Indian diplomat and a Red Cross representative. After an exchange of documents, a large metal gate was opened, Varthaman strode through and soldiers on the Indian side put their arms around the pilot to welcome him home. The transfer was expected much earlier Friday, and Indian media reported a delay over documents. Ahead of the pilot's release, several dozen people waving Indian flags had gathered on the Indian side of the border. But most had dispersed by the time Varthaman finally crossed. Authorities canceled a daily sunset marching drill that involves elaborately strutting border guards from both sides and that often attracts tourists. Pakistani Prime Minister Imran Khan said the pilot was released as a \"peace gesture.\" His fighter jet was shot down over Pakistani-administered Kashmir on Wednesday, when both countries accused the other of entering rival airspace. Following his release, Varthaman was taken for a medical exam, Air Vice Marshal R.G.K. Kapoor told reporters. Next he is expected to be flown to the Indian capital, New Delhi, where his parents are waiting. They received a standing ovation from fellow passengers on a flight to the capital early Friday. Despite hopes on both sides that the pilot's release might prompt a de-escalation, shelling continues along the Line of Control, the de facto border between the Indian- and Pakistani-controlled parts of Kashmir, a Muslim-majority Himalayan region that the two countries have fought three wars over. Two Indian troops and two rebels were reportedly killed in a gun battle Friday on the Indian side. The latest tensions began Feb. 14, when a suicide car bombing killed 40 Indian troops on the outskirts of Srinagar, the main city in Indian-administered Kashmir. A Pakistani-based militant group, Jaish-e-Mohammed, claimed responsibility even though the bomber himself was a local man. In retaliation, India claimed to have conducted airstrikes Tuesday on an alleged Jaish-e-Mohammed training camp inside Pakistani-controlled territory, killing \"a very large number of terrorists.\" But Pakistan denied any damage or casualties, and some international observers have cast doubt on India's claims. Amid tensions between the nuclear-armed neighbors, India has arrested at least 400 separatists and members of a political and religious group that lobbies for an independent Kashmir. Late Thursday, India announced a five-year ban on that group, Jamaat-e-Islami, accusing it of links to militants. The group, created in 1942, runs schools, charities and libraries across Kashmir, and it has been banned in India twice before.

On Friday, Indian police laid razor wire and erected iron barricades in downtown Srinagar, prohibiting weekly Friday prayers at the city's main mosque. Unlike Pakistan's Khan, who addressed the nation and a joint session of Parliament in recent days, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi kept to his regular schedule of travel and rallies. He is running for a second term in elections expected this spring. At an event Friday in Tamil Nadu, the pilot's home state, Modi accused opposition political parties of \"helping Pakistan and harming India.\" \"This is a new India! This is an India that will return the damage done by terrorists with interest,\" Modi told the crowd. Also Friday, India's minister of external affairs, Sushma Swaraj, was the guest of honor at a meeting of the Organization of Islamic Cooperation in Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates. It was the first time India was invited to the gathering of 57 Muslim-majority states. \"If we want to save humanity, then we must tell the states who provide shelter and funding to terrorists to dismantle the infrastructure of terrorist camps,\" Swaraj told the OIC. \"This menace cannot be fought only through military, intelligence or diplomatic means. It is also a battle that must be won through the strengths of our values and the real message of religions.\" The foreign minister of Pakistan, an OIC member, skipped the meeting in protest at Swaraj being invited.",

After filing a sexual harassment complaint against Sheriff Gerald Antinoro, Keener was removed from her position as the sheriff's chief deputy. In a small county in rural northern Nevada, Melanie Keener was once the second-most powerful person in law enforcement. She was Storey County's chief deputy, overseeing detentions, investigations and the patrol division. That ended in 2016 when she reported her boss, Sheriff Gerald Antinoro, for sexual harassment. \"Coming forward has broke me,\" Keener said. Reporting her boss, she said, has ruined her nearly 20-year law enforcement career. She was removed from her position and relegated to an isolated desk in the Storey County Courthouse in Virginia City. Meanwhile, the man she accused, Antinoro, remains the top law enforcement official in Storey County. He's still sheriff even after an internal investigation of her complaint found that Antinoro had violated the county's sexual harassment policy. Accusations against Antinoro aren't limited to Keener's suit. In fact, the county administrator said in court proceedings that there have been \"numerous\" complaints against the sheriff. Court documents, a police report, interviews and state ethics commission hearings detail multiple other allegations. They range from harassment to using racial slurs and misusing government resources. There also are more serious allegations, including rape. The allegations have prompted Antinoro's critics in this rural county, with a population of about 4,000, to ask what it takes to unseat a man accused of so much misconduct, especially toward women.

Antinoro, known as Jerry, has never been prosecuted for a crime. He denies all the allegations that have been made against him, saying they're part of an organized witch hunt by people who don't like having a law-enforcing sheriff in town. In fact, he won his third term to office last year and beat a recall effort by his opponents. \"The people of Storey County haven't bought into their nonsense,\" Antinoro said in an interview at his office in Virginia City. \"And they keep returning me to office because obviously somebody thinks I'm doing a good job and that I'm a decent guy.\" The law enforcement convention Keener's lawsuit details what allegedly happened between her and Antinoro. She claims her troubles began on a business trip to Ely, Nev., for a law enforcement convention in 2015.  Keener and Antinoro drove the roughly five-hour drive together. On the last night, after a little gambling and light drinking, she and Antinoro walked back to their separate rooms. She said she told him about \"blowing\" $80 gambling. In her room, while she was washing her face and changing for bed, she heard the ding of a text message. It was from Antinoro. \"And about that blowing thing...LOL,\" it said, followed by a smiley-face emoji. She deflected what she read as clear sexual innuendo. She texted back that she'd probably lost $100 altogether. She said she was trying to steer the conversation back to a place where she felt comfortable without upsetting her boss. She got another text: \"I'm bored stiff over here. LOL.\" Then another asking her to grab another drink. Keener told him she was going to bed. The next day, the car ride home was equally uncomfortable when he started talking. Overlooking a snow-covered Virginia City.

I was terrified that I would lose my job. So I didn't say anything. And then the treatment just got worse.\" She said she was silent as Antinoro detailed his visits to swinger clubs, his penchant for watching his girlfriend at the time have sex with other men in public. She wrote it all down in a statement for the county's internal investigation, which was included in court proceedings. \"I don't know \u2014 maybe I didn't respond the way he thought I would,\" she said. Her cool reaction to Antinoro's sexual banter, she alleged, led to months of growing hostile behavior. Antinoro would throw his feet up on her desk repeatedly when she was speaking. Once, fed up, she claims she put her gum on his shoe in protest. He scraped it off and threw it at her head. A Polaroid picture of Melanie Keener on her first day as a police officer.

Storey County's development Storey County isn't well known outside Nevada. It's about 22 miles southeast of Reno and some 44 miles northeast of Lake Tahoe, near the California-Nevada border. The county seat, Virginia City, is a former silver and gold mining town that was the setting of the TV Western Bonanza. Many of its storefronts still look like they're right out of the late 1800s. The few hundred locals in Virginia City frequent the Bucket of Blood Saloon, built in 1876. It's just down the street from the sheriff's office, past the Virginia City Outlaws theater and across from Grandma's Fudge Factory. The majority of residents are older retirees, and tourists head here for the preserved charm of the Old West. But there has been a push in recent years to lure high-tech businesses to the area. That infusion of new money is bringing new scrutiny to local government and the people who run it. The county seat, Virginia City, was once a silver and gold mining town.

In this rural area, though, women have few recourses against elected county officials, said Marlene Lockard of the nonpartisan Nevada Women's Lobby. \"In this day and age, the message this sends to women is alarming, and I do think that women in that community are afraid to come forward,\" Lockard said. The Nevada Women's Lobby is pushing for legislation to allow a \"provision of impeachment or removal\" for an elected county official who has been found to have violated sexual harassment policies multiple times. \"[Storey County] really is the last vestiges. It's a tired old saw where the good old boys reign,\" Lockard said. \"I think this legislation and the efforts of many different resources in Nevada will send them a message: Just because you're a lone county in rural Nevada doesn't mean the women there should be treated any differently.\" Virginia City is a small town, which means pretty much everyone knows about the sheriff's troubles \u2014 and about his feud with Lance Gilman. Lance Gilman is a county commissioner and the owner of the famous Mustang Ranch brothel, an important source of revenue for the county.\n                \n                    \n                    Maggie Starbard for NPR\n                    \n                \nhide caption Lance Gilman is a county commissioner and the owner of the famous Mustang Ranch brothel, an important source of revenue for the county. Gilman is also a well-known and powerful man around town. He's a county commissioner and the owner of the famous Mustang Ranch brothel, an important source of revenue for the county. Gilman said it pays hundreds of thousands of dollars in taxes and fees each year. Along with his business partner, Roger Norman, Gilman is responsible for bringing more than 100 companies to the Tahoe Reno Industrial Center. They include tech giants like Tesla and Google. He said the businesses have taken the county from one of the poorest in Nevada to potentially the wealthiest. Gilman wants Antinoro removed from office, saying it's not good for business to have a man accused of sexual assault and harassment in charge of law enforcement. Gilman and his business partner spearheaded an unsuccessful recall effort against the sheriff that ended in 2017. He's also suing Antinoro for defamation. Antinoro said Gilman is out to get him because Gilman doesn't like the way he enforces the law at the brothel \u2014 something Gilman insists is not true. Meanwhile, Gilman said the businesses he has brought to town are concerned. \"It's had a worry impact on the businesses. Obviously they're here. Obviously we're successful,\" Gilman said. \"They are all, unfortunately, aware of what we have going on.\" Allegations of rape The most serious accusation against Antinoro is rape. In a 2014 Sparks, Nev., police report, a woman said that Antinoro, then a deputy in the sheriff's office, raped her in 2006 at the direction of another sheriff's office employee. The woman, afraid of being identified, reported the alleged rape to police under a pseudonym. She didn't know Antinoro, she said, but did know the other man. \"They both were in full uniform with guns,\" their accuser said in an interview with NPR. She spoke on the condition of anonymity, still afraid of the men. She said it took her about eight years to gather the courage to report the alleged rape to police, she said. \"I knew it was gonna be very hard for people to believe that these two had done that,\" she said. After all, they were in law enforcement. \"I was scared.\" The Storey County Sheriff's Office in Virginia City.

Sheriff Antinoro's nine years in the position are marred by multiple accusations that range from harassment to alleged criminal behavior. They include rape, organizing the gang rape of a woman, sexual harassment, using racial slurs and misusing government resources. She's still afraid. She recounted the alleged assault in an interview on the condition that she'd never be identified. She told police she was asleep at home when she heard the crackle of a police radio. \"I was not awake when it first started happening, and when I became fully awake and realized what was going on, I was rigid with fear,\" she said. She said she was forced to perform oral sex on Antinoro at the direction of the other man. Then Antinoro raped her as the other man watched, pleasuring himself. NPR is not naming that man because his accuser is afraid that identifying him will identify her. \"Then they both got up, got dressed and left,\" she said. \"My family doesn't know about it. My friends don't know about it. I'm embarrassed. I know I shouldn't be, because I was the victim. But I am embarrassed that somebody had that kind of control over me.\" Too ashamed to initially confide in friends or family, she turned to alcohol. She said that because of the drinking, she lost her job and custody of her daughter. \"I was trying to block it out. Just trying to get all the memories to go away,\" she said. \"Beating myself up because I shouldn't have let it happen.\" Finally she told a friend. In 2014, she reported it to the Sparks police near Storey County, about eight years after the alleged assault. But police couldn't pursue the case. The statute of limitations had run out. She's sober now, she has a steady job and she has spent a lot of time in therapy. But she's still afraid. Many accusations against Antinoro are documented in hundreds of pages of depositions in the two lawsuits against the sheriff, a police report alleging rape and interviews with alleged victims and their lawyers. And yet he has never been prosecuted.\n                \n                    \n                    Maggie Starbard for NPR\n                    \n                \nhide caption Many accusations against Antinoro are documented in hundreds of pages of depositions in the two lawsuits against the sheriff, a police report alleging rape and interviews with alleged victims and their lawyers.

Because I think, 'What if it's one of them?' \" Antinoro denies he raped the woman. He said in a deposition that it was consensual and didn't involve anyone else. Another alleged assault is also detailed in Keener's sexual harassment lawsuit.  This one involved a woman who said she was romantically involved with Antinoro. She has never reported her alleged rape to police \u2014 she and her lawyer said she's too afraid to speak about what allegedly happened. She did not speak with NPR, and NPR is not identifying her because she is the alleged victim of a sexual assault. In her deposition, she testified that she met Antinoro at her job. In 2015, he heard her birthday was coming up, and he asked her to go skydiving. \"It's always been on my bucket list,\" she said she told him.

Despite many allegations, he has won three elections and beat a recall effort by his opponents. She'd been divorced for a few years, and he seemed nice. So she said yes. \"The more things we did, I, I just felt comfortable with him,\" she testified in her deposition. \"I thought he was an OK guy, you know?\" She agreed to go with him to Lodi, Calif., for a romantic weekend. He asked her to wear a dress he liked. They swam at the hotel pool, had dinner and cocktails, then went for a swim again. That's when things turned. She testified that she looked up from the pool and saw Antinoro speaking to three men she didn't recognize. She asked who they were \u2014 friends of his? He said no, they were there to have sex with her. She said she was shocked and that she didn't want to do it. She threatened to call the police if he didn't make them leave. She said she went to the room; Antinoro followed her. She went to the bathroom. Then the door opened. One of the men from the pool was there. He pulled her out of the bathroom. \"And then they just, they threw me up against one of the other guys,\" she testified. \"I started screaming and screaming, and the other guy that was there put some duct tape on my mouth and threw me on the bed. It was all over after that.\" She testified that the three strangers raped her. Antinoro was there at the beginning, she said, but she was so distraught as she tried to fight the men off that she's not sure if he stayed. The next morning, she said, Antinoro acted like nothing had happened. \"He set me up to get raped,\" she said in her testimony. Afraid, she pretended everything was fine until she got home and away from Antinoro. She has never pressed charges, also out of fear. On the day she was deposed, she was still afraid. \"I'm scared to death of him,\" she said in her testimony. She went on: \"Now that I've given this testimony, well, what's he going to do? ... That's why I didn't want to do this.\" Her statement was referred to police in Lodi, Calif., by the Nevada attorney general. The police opened a case in 2018, then closed it. To protect the identity of any possible victims of sexual assault, they would not discuss the case. Antinoro denies the allegations against him. \"It's a concerted effort by a small group of people to try and remove me from office,\" he said.

He denies the allegations. He spoke at length to NPR from his office about the accusations. He called every assault accusation a fabrication. He attributed the sexual harassment findings and the reports of racist language in the Keener complaint as people being politically correct. He also denies the more serious accusations. The alleged rape in Sparks, Nev.? \"It was false then and it's false now, no truth to it whatsoever,\" he said. The orchestrated gang rape in Lodi, Calif.? \"That is a complete and utter fabrication. Plain and simple,\" he said. He does acknowledge he has called white people the N-word, but he doesn't see that as racist. The conversation about his sex life with Keener, his former chief deputy, during their car ride home from the conference? He said if it bothered her she should've said something. As far as the text messages to Keener? \"There was no sexual innuendo. Never had any interest in her in that manner,\" he said. \"And, you know, it makes me not want to talk to anybody because you can take anything and turn it into sexual connotation.\" Antinoro's opponents say they are determined to remove him from office.\n                \n                    \n                    Maggie Starbard for NPR\n                    \n                \nhide caption Antinoro's opponents say they are determined to remove him from office. So why would so many people make up these stories? \"It's a concerted effort by a small group of people to try and remove me from office,\" Antinoro said. Because \"I enforce the rules, I follow the law and I don't give people breaks.\" Before landing in Storey County, he bounced around different law enforcement agencies in Utah and then in Nevada. He was known as Gerald Cook until about 17 years ago, when he changed his name. He said he wanted to retake his family's Italian name. He was \"invited to leave his position\" as chief enforcement officer at the Nevada Transportation Authority in 2006, he said in court proceedings, though it's unclear why. Later that year, he joined the Storey County Sheriff's Office as a deputy. In 2010, he was elected to his first term as sheriff. He sits at his desk. On the bookshelf nearby is a framed picture of him and President Trump. He said he related to Trump because he was accused of so many \"false\" things driven, he said, by political vendettas. \"That's why,\" he said, he wrote the president a letter of support. \"Knowing what I've gone through,\" he said. He related. He got a signed response back. \"Dear Sheriff Antinoro, thank you for your kind letter of support,\" it reads. \"I appreciate your service to our nation as Sheriff of the Storey County Police Department.\" Antinoro framed it and put it on the shelf next to the picture in his office. Ethics commission investigation Antinoro's opponents, though, are determined to remove him from that office; chief among them is Gilman. Lance Gilman is largely responsible for bringing tech giants like Tesla to Storey County. He and his business partner at the Tahoe Reno Industrial Center spearheaded an effort to recall the sheriff, but Antinoro prevailed.\n                \n                    \n                    Maggie Starbard for NPR\n                    \n                \nhide caption Lance Gilman is largely responsible for bringing tech giants like Tesla to Storey County.

The sheriff's opponents asked the Nevada attorney general's office to review all the allegations. A statement from the attorney general's office said investigators \"spent hundreds of hours conducting a thorough investigation of allegations related to Storey County Sheriff Antinoro, including coordinating with the FBI.\" But it said it \"found no criminal conduct within our office's jurisdiction to prosecute.\" The statement pointed out that matters like sexual harassment fall under the Nevada Equal Rights Commission and the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission. It closed the investigation last year. \"This isn't about politics,\" Keener says. \"This is about an individual that is the highest law enforcement authority in Storey County.\"\n                \n                    \n                    Maggie Starbard for NPR\n                    \n                \nhide caption \"This isn't about politics,\" Keener says. \"This is about an individual that is the highest law enforcement authority in Storey County.\" Now Gilman is pinning his hopes on the Nevada Commission on Ethics. If a county official is found to have \"willfully violated\" the ethics of his office three times, the commission must file a removal complaint with the courts, said Yvonne Nevarez-Goodson, the commission's executive director. Antinoro has been found to have willfully violated the ethics of his office twice. He is appealing one of those decisions and plans to appeal the other. Meanwhile, women like Keener say they worry that she and his other alleged victims will be dismissed as political pawns. \"This isn't about politics. This is about an individual that is the highest law enforcement authority in Storey County,\" she said. \"To see it as politics, that takes away from those that have been victimized by him.\"",

Venezuelan President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro, who is facing international pressure to step down after elections widely seen as rigged, ordered the country's vast border with Brazil to be closed. The move will make it harder for aid groups to get emergency food and medicine into the country. The U.S. and some other countries have recognized Juan Guaid\u00f3, the parliamentary opposition leader, as the legitimate president of Venezuela. Guaid\u00f3 is embracing the support and has promised to bring in emergency aid to help the poor country. However, Maduro and his allies view the aid \u2014 particularly that coming from the U.S. \u2014 as part of an attempt to destabilize his government, ushering in regime change. Maduro has told Venezuelans that he believes the humanitarian effort is actually a pretext for a U.S. invasion. \"Maduro has remained firm, saying that this aid at the border will not come in,\" NPR's Eyder Peralta, reporting from Venezuela, told All Things Considered. \"He views it as a foreign invasion, and he has asked his military to act accordingly.\" Earlier this month, Maduro blocked one of the busiest highways on the Colombian border, preventing the entry of food and medicine there. Maduro said Thursday that he might also shut the border with Colombia, according to The Associated Press. A looming showdown may come to a head on Saturday. That's when Guaid\u00f3 has declared that tons of international aid, currently warehoused along the border, must be brought into the country \u2014 either peacefully, or by force. So far the country's military has stood by Maduro, but President Trump has warned Venezuelan troops against trying to stop the flow of aid. \"If you choose this path, you will find no safe harbor, no easy exit and no way out. You will lose everything,\" Trump said in Miami this week, directly addressing the Venezuelan military. To the crowd, he said, \"End this nightmare of poverty, hunger and death for your people.\" Thousands of volunteers have amassed at the border to help bring the food and medicine into the country. Opposition politicians left the country's capital Thursday to drive to the border, but they were blocked by security officials. Peralta, who was traveling with the politicians, says that thousands of cars were blocked on one of the most important highways in Venezuela. After Maduro announced the Brazilian border would be closed indefinitely, Venezuelans rushed into Brazil to buy groceries, Brazilian media reported.",

And, an update on Syria's humanitarian crisis.  RACHEL MARTIN, HOST: President Trump is starting his 2020 campaign with a push to change the president in a different country. DAVID GREENE, HOST: That's right. He was holding a rally in Miami yesterday. The crowd there was mostly Venezuelan and Cuban immigrants. And President Trump repeated his call for Venezuela's president, Nicolas Maduro, to go. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Maduro not a Venezuelan patriot. He is a Cuban puppet. GREENE: The president reiterated U.S. support for opposition leader Juan Guaido, and he called on the Venezuelan military to abandon Maduro or risk losing everything. MARTIN: We've got NPR White House correspondent Scott Horsley with us this morning. Hey, Scott. SCOTT HORSLEY, BYLINE: Good morning, Rachel. MARTIN: What are the politics behind this speech? I mean, who was the president's intended audience? HORSLEY: Well, this was partly aimed at the military and other parts of the Venezuelan government who've been propping up Maduro. You know, some 50 other countries have now joined the U.S. in supporting the National Assembly president, Juan Guaido, as the legitimate leader of Venezuela. MARTIN: Right. HORSLEY: And Trump is calling on those who are supporting Maduro in Venezuela to do the same. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) TRUMP: The eyes of the entire world are upon you - today, every day and every day in the future. You cannot hide from the choice that now confronts you. HORSLEY: But, Rachel, this speech was also directed at the audience of Venezuelan expats right there in South Florida, a group that is overwhelmingly opposed to the Maduro government and, by the way, a group that could be a big source of support for the president in a 2020 swing state MARTIN: Right. Florida - kind of important. So that's the politics. What about the policy? I mean, what is the next move for the Trump administration when it comes to Venezuela? HORSLEY: The president didn't telegraph his next move, although the White House always says all options are on the table. Of course, the big move that the Trump administration has taken is to impose economic sanctions on Venezuela's national oil company, starving Maduro of an important source of revenue. The U.S. is also trying to deliver humanitarian assistance to the Venezuelan people, although so far that aid has been mostly stopped at the Colombian border. But as we said, this speech was really more of a raucous political rally than a sober foreign policy address, where a lot of new policies were rolled out. MARTIN: Right. And you can't really have a political rally right now in February of 2019 without projecting towards the 2020 election, can you? And the president took that opportunity. HORSLEY: Just as he did in his State of the Union address, the president combined his attack on corrupt socialist government in Venezuela with left-leaning policies put forward by some Democrats here at home. He declared that socialism is dying across the Western Hemisphere, and he repeated his vow that America will never be a socialist country. MARTIN: The implication, of course, being there that the Democrats would put forth some kind of socialist agenda that his base and perhaps others would not find palatable in the 2020 election. Scott Horsley, thank you for your time, as always. HORSLEY: You're very welcome, Rachel. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) MARTIN: OK. It has been months since the midterm elections. A new Congress has been sworn in, but one House seat remains in dispute. GREENE: It sure does. That seat is in North Carolina's 9th Congressional District. Republican Mark Harris leads Democrat Dan McCready in an unofficial tally, but no result has been declared because of these allegations of fraud and misconduct. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) KIM STRACH: We believe the evidence will show that a coordinated, unlawful and substantially resourced absentee ballot scheme operated in the 2018 general election. GREENE: That's the voice of Kim Strach. She's the executive director of North Carolina's state elections board. That was at a hearing yesterday where investigators are detailing what they have learned, and that hearing is going to go on today. MARTIN: NPR's Miles Parks has been covering this story from the beginning and joins us now. Hey, Miles MILES PARKS, BYLINE: Good morning. MARTIN: So unlawful, coordinated scheme - can you just remind us about the scope of these charges? What are we talking about? PARKS: Right. So the investigation is centered on a man named McCrae Dowless, who was working as a political contractor for Republican Mark Harris' campaign. Dowless is alleged to have been paying people to register voters, as well as paying people to pick up ballots, which is illegal in North Carolina. What's still unclear is whether Dowless turned in all the ballots he and his team collected or whether they were manipulated or thrown away or anything like that. The numbers in the county where Dowless worked were really tilted toward Harris in a way that made the state board, as well as election watchers nationally, really suspicious. MARTIN: So this - these hearings are happening, right? Who testified, and what was communicated during the hearing? PARKS: Right. So day one was taken up mostly by Dowless' former stepdaughter. Her name is Lisa Britt, and she said Dowless paid her to pick up people's ballots. She also said she even filled out some down-ballot races for people who left them blank, basically as a means to get rid of a red flag for the state board of elections. The most dramatic moment of the day came when Britt was talking about how Dowless actually tried to interfere in the state board's investigation. Britt said Dowless reached out to her multiple times, and he even tried to tell her exactly what to say at Monday's hearing. MARTIN: So what is Dowless himself saying? PARKS: Nothing at this point. He was actually called to testify at the end of the day yesterday, but that didn't end up happening. Basically, he wasn't compelled legally to testify because under state law, for the board to do that, they would have had to also grant him immunity from being prosecuted for that testimony at a later date. Here's board chair Robert Cordle. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) ROBERT CORDLE: And this board is unwilling to give a witness here, and particularly Mr. Dowless, immunity from his testimony. PARKS: Dowless' attorney, Cynthia Singletary, told reporters after the hearing that Dowless would, quote, \"love to testify under the right circumstances,\" but she did not elaborate on what those right circumstances would have to be. MARTIN: But, clearly, there's still some legal jeopardy ahead perhaps for him. Is the end game a new election? I mean, what happens with the seat? PARKS: That's definitely one possibility. The board is made up of three Democrats and two Republicans, and they need to come to some sort of bipartisan agreement at the end of this hearing to either hold a new election or to certify Harris. If they don't, then Harris does technically get certified no matter what. But that certification goes to the U.S. House to approve it or deem the seat vacant. A lot of this just depends on what is the exact amount of fraud or manipulation that deems an entire election in an entire congressional district moot. We know that Dowless and his team filled out more than a thousand registration forms, but we still don't know how many ballots were actually affected by them and how close that actually was to Harris' 900-vote lead. We may never know exactly how many ballots Dowless and his team affected. MARTIN: What about broader implications of this case? PARKS: Well, we know that Democrats in the House have decided to make election security a big priority now that they control the chamber. So you can definitely see the writing on the wall, if this does end up being deadlocked at the state level and get to the national level, that Democrats in the House will - can make this a sort of rallying cry. We saw that in Georgia, and we saw that in Florida in the midterms, as well, with election administration. People I've talked to in the elections world have also been really interested in the fact that President Trump hasn't weighed in yet. MARTIN: Right. Because he has done so on this issue before when it was to his advantage, even though those claims were unsubstantiated. NPR's Miles Parks, thanks. PARKS: Thank you. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) MARTIN: All right. We're going to turn now to Syria and the last stand of ISIS in the region. GREENE: Yeah, and a pretty tense situation. So here it is. You have U.S. forces in Syria. They are holding hundreds of ISIS fighters who traveled to Syria from Europe. The Trump administration is getting ready to pull its troops out of the country, and as part of that, they want European countries to take responsibility for those prisoners by accepting them back to their home countries. MARTIN: NPR's Ruth Sherlock has been following this closely and joins us now from Beirut. Hey, Ruth. RUTH SHERLOCK, BYLINE: Hello. MARTIN: So we're talking about hundreds - 800 prisoners - that the U.S. is holding that have kind of a European connection, are from Europe. What are European nations saying? Are they going to take these prisoners back? SHERLOCK: Well, I mean, first of all, the problem is actually much bigger than just the 800 prisoners. There's also about 2,000 women and children from some 46 countries that the Kurds are holding. So, you know, you've also got a lot of civilians. Over a thousand of these people are children. MARTIN: Wow. SHERLOCK: But - yeah. But taking these people back is very politically unpalatable for many European countries. So Britain has stripped some of these people of their nationality. Belgium and France apparently tried to strike a deal whereby they'd take back the children but not the women and certainly not the male prisoners. President Trump is now urging them to take these people back, but so far, France has responded by sort of ignoring that request, saying, no, we're going to deal with them on a case-by-case basis. The Kurds that are holding them, by the same token, are also afraid to just release these people because, you know, should there ever be a terror attack in Europe in the future and should ever be traced back to any of these people, that would be very dangerous for them, too. They would get blamed. MARTIN: Meanwhile, the fight against ISIS continues, even though President Trump keeps insisting that their defeat is near. How much ISIS - how much territory does ISIS actually still hold in Syria? SHERLOCK: Well, it comes down to a few hundred square meters. And it's really just a hamlet of tents now. You can actually look through binoculars and see people moving around. They can't take this area, though, because there are lots of civilians, locals - fighters I've spoken to estimate there's over a thousand civilians - that's U.S.-backed fighters. Most of these are hostages that ISIS have taken or families of ISIS fighters. So negotiations are underway to try to find a solution to this. I should say, that though the territory that ISIS controls is about to be taken back, ISIS remains a threat, according to U.S. officials. The group itself is not defeated. MARTIN: Right. And, of course, all this is affecting countless civilians. And you have been to Syria. You have heard some of these stories. Can you just give us a sense of what life is like right now? SHERLOCK: It's terrible. The conditions in al-Hol camp that we went to, the main camp for where people from this area have been fleeing, are awful. People can't even get tents in some situations. The International Rescue Committee says that more than 60 people have died trying to leave this area and get - or once they arrive in the camp. And overall, you know, entire swathes of northeastern Syria and the whole city of Raqqa has been decimated in the fight against ISIS. So civilians are suffering desperately. Many thousands have died, and many don't have their home. They don't have homes to go to any longer. MARTIN: NPR's Ruth Sherlock for us this morning. Ruth, thank you so much. We appreciate it. SHERLOCK: Thank you. (SOUNDBITE OF JESSE COOK'S \"STEAMPUNK RICKSHAW\") Copyright \u00a9 2019 NPR.  All rights reserved.

A new NPR/PBS NewsHour/Marist poll finds most Americans don't think there is an emergency. More than 6-in-10 Americans disapprove of President Trump's decision to declare a national emergency so he can build barriers along the U.S border with Mexico, a new NPR/PBS NewsHour/Marist poll finds. Loading... Don't see the graphic above? Click here. Nearly 6-in-10 also don't believe there is an emergency at the southern border and that the president is misusing his presidential authority. They also believe that his decision should be challenged in court. \"All things related to the declaring of a national emergency, the president is striking out in the court of public opinion,\" said Lee Miringoff, director of the Marist Institute for Public Opinion, which conducted the survey. \"He's maintaining his base and little else.\" Republicans and Trump supporters are firmly with the president, while Democrats and independents disapprove. These numbers slightly outpace, but are largely reflective of, the president's overall approval rating. Loading... Don't see the graphic above? Click here. \"This is not a break-his-base issue,\" Miringoff said. \"This is a reinforce-his-base issue, but this is not an expand-beyond-his-base issue.\" So, to sum up: Not many beyond his base like this; it's unprecedented; and Americans are very polarized. That's been the story of the Trump presidency so far. Trump has done little to move beyond his base, and that theory of politics \u2013 revving up the base and not winning over the middle \u2013 is going to be tested in 2020. It's part of what led to Democrats to winning 40 seats that were previously held by Republicans in the 2018 midterms. Some key numbers from the poll: --61 percent disapprove, 36 percent approve Trump declaring a national emergency to build a wall along the U.S.- Mexico border. (85 percent of Republicans approve, 84 percent of Democrats disapprove, 63 percent of independents disapprove) --60 percent think his decision should be challenged in the courts, including 60 percent of independents --58 percent do not think there is a national emergency at the border. (84 percent of Republicans and 90 percent of Trump supporters think there is. Democrats and independents don't.) --57 percent think Trump is misusing his presidential power. (89 percent of Democrats and 61 percent of independents think he is, while 80 percent of Republicans don't). --54 percent say this decision makes them less likely to vote for Trump in 2020, but for context, the president's disapproval rating in the January NPR/PBS NewsHour poll was 53 percent. The NPR/PBS NewsHour/Marist poll was conducted Feb. 15 through Feb. 17, surveyed 807 adults and has a margin of error of +/- 4.6 percentage points.",

Updated at 6:15 p.m. ET Calling it \"a great thing to do,\" President Trump declared a national emergency on Friday in order to help finance a long-promised wall on the U.S.-Mexico border. It's a highly unusual move from an unconventional president. In circuitous remarks in the Rose Garden, Trump said he was declaring an emergency because of \"an invasion of our country with drugs, with human traffickers, with all types of criminals and gangs.\" The move came a day after Congress approved a spending bill giving Trump around $1.3 billion in border security funding, far short of the $5.7 billion he had called for. Trump signed the bill Friday afternoon, averting another government shutdown until at least October. Invoking emergency powers frees up additional funding. Legal challenges and pushback even from some within his own party await Trump in the next phase of the ongoing national political battle over border security and immigration policy \u2014 cementing the issues at the forefront of his bid for a second term. The House Judiciary Committee announced Friday evening that it is launching an \"immediate investigation\" into Trump's decision to declare the national emergency. The committee is requesting that those involved in the declaration, including White House counsel Pat Cipollone, testify on Capitol Hill. Chairman Jerry Nadler, D-N.Y., and six other House Democrats who chair subcommittees of the judiciary panel, signed the letter to the president, writing that \"we believe your declaration of an emergency shows a reckless disregard for the separation of powers and your own responsibilities under our constitutional system.\" Opponents of the declaration say that Trump's claim of a crisis at the border is overblown and that the move is unnecessary. Illegal border crossings in the most recent fiscal year (ending in September 2018) were actually lower than in either 2016 or 2014 and much lower than at their peak around 2000, as NPR has previously fact-checked. Many of the most recent arrivals are Central American migrants seeking asylum, citing a fear of violence or persecution back home. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., issued a statement sharply critical of the president's action. The statement said, in part: \"The President's unlawful declaration over a crisis that does not exist does great violence to our Constitution and makes America less safe, stealing from urgently needed defense funds for the security of our military and our nation. ... \"The President's actions clearly violate the Congress's exclusive power of the purse, which our Founders enshrined in the Constitution. The Congress will defend our constitutional authorities in the Congress, in the Courts, and in the public, using every remedy available.\" White House officials say Trump's executive action, including the emergency declaration, will free up about $8 billion for border wall construction. That includes the $1.375 billion in the funding bill passed by Congress on Thursday. The balance of the funds include: No disaster money will be used. Rep. Adam Smith, a Washington Democrat who chairs the Armed Services Committee, called the reallocation of funds \"utterly disrespectful of U.S. national security and the needs of our men and women in uniform, and it further undermines his credibility in requesting the upcoming defense budget.\" White House officials say the $8 billion should allow Trump to build as much wall as he wanted to \u2014 234 miles of barrier \u2014 had Congress authorized the $5.7 billion he asked for. Officials say plans are to construct a metal bollard barrier, not a concrete wall, at locations to be determined by Customs and Border Protection. Trump said Friday that he expects such legal challenges and predicted they would eventually reach the Supreme Court, where, he said, \"We'll win, I think.\" \"I didn't need to do this,\" Trump said in response to a reporter's question about the emergency declaration. \"I just want to get it done faster, that's all.\" Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., who had previously cautioned Trump against declaring a national emergency, said Thursday he was on board with the president's move. However, others within the GOP have pushed back. Centrist Sen. Susan Collins, R-Maine, who is up for re-election in 2020, called Trump's planned move a \"mistake\" in a statement Thursday. Collins also argued that the National Emergencies Act was only \"intended to apply to major natural disasters or catastrophic events, such as the attacks on our country.\" \"Such a declaration would undermine the role of Congress and the appropriations process; it's just not good policy. It also sets a bad precedent for future presidents \u2014 both Democratic and Republican \u2014 who might seek to use this same maneuver to circumvent Congress to advance their policy goals. It is also of dubious constitutionality, and it will almost certainly be challenged in the courts,\" Collins said. Rep. Will Hurd, R-Texas, whose districts covers about 800 miles along the U.S.-Mexico border, said Friday on The View that the declaration was \"unnecessary\" and expressed concerns about the land seizures that would have to take place in order to build the wall. \"What we should be talking about is the strategy on how to defend our border, not one specific tool, which is the wall,\" Hurd said. But to Trump, declaring a national emergency likely seems to be the only way he can claim victory after weeks of back-and-forth over funding for border security that included a record 35-day partial government shutdown.

John Cornyn (on the left of him) and Ted Cruz (on the right) near the Rio Grande in McAllen, Texas, on Jan. 10. Another shutdown would have been risky, and there wasn't much appetite for going that route again among congressional Republicans. But there's little support among the public for Trump's approach either. A CNN poll earlier this month showed Americans oppose \u2014 by more than 2 to 1 \u2014 Trump using a national emergency declaration to build a border wall. That seems to be one of the messages Democratic leaders will home in on during what is likely to be a new phase in the standoff over border security. In the Democrats' Spanish-language response to Trump's State of the Union earlier this month, California Attorney General Xavier Becerra said he would sue the administration if Trump declared a national emergency to find funds for a border wall. On Friday, appearing alongside California Gov. Gavin Newsom, Becerra said a lawsuit would likely be coming soon. \"This is not 9/11. This is not the Iran hostage crisis of 1979,\" Becerra said, citing past presidential emergency declarations. \"This is a president showing his disdain for the rule of law and our U.S. Constitution.\" Added Newsom, \"Donald Trump, we'll see you court.\" NPR's Scott Horsley, Tamara Keith and Kelsey Snell contributed to this story.",

The New Hampshire primary is tentatively scheduled for Feb. 11, 2020, which is only \u2014 or \"still,\" depending on your tolerance for campaign coverage \u2014 about a year away. And for the past half-century, one of the most recognizable symbols of the Granite State's early electoral contest has been Dixville Notch's midnight vote. Since 1960, the citizens of this tiny hamlet about 20 miles south of the Canadian border have gathered at midnight to cast the first official ballots in the presidential race, while camera crews gather to cover a ritual that's viewed by many as democracy in its purest form. The tradition is so storied that it was once even part of plotline fodder on The West Wing. But Dixville Notch has recently found itself facing a less flattering kind of spotlight: from the New Hampshire attorney general's office. State election investigators started scrutinizing its local voter checklist shortly after the 2016 presidential election, in response to complaints questioning whether everyone who was voting in Dixville Notch actually lived there. Voters prepare to cast their ballots inside polling booths just after midnight on Nov. 6, 2012, in Dixville Notch, N.H.\n                \n                    \n                    Rogerio Barbosa/AFP/Getty Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption Voters prepare to cast their ballots inside polling booths just after midnight on Nov. 6, 2012, in Dixville Notch, N.H. One of the complaints that triggered the state's investigation came from a woman who watched television coverage of Dixville Notch's famous tradition. She recognized one of the people voting in Dixville Notch because he lived in her hometown. \"The transparency of the media coverage is part of what led to the concerns that were raised with our office regarding Dixville Notch and whether there were irregularities with the 2016 elections,\" says New Hampshire Associate Attorney General Anne Edwards. Once investigators started looking more closely, it didn't take long to pinpoint those irregularities \u2014 because Dixville Notch's voter lists aren't very long. Fewer than a dozen people voted in Dixville Notch in 2016. Most of them, the state determined, probably should have voted somewhere else. 'Ghost town' Dixville Notch isn't the only New Hampshire community that opens its polls for presidential elections at midnight. But it gets most of the press coverage. That has meant longtime Dixville Notch voters like Peter Johnson, who has been casting a ballot there since the 1980s, have made cameos in all kinds of news stories on this quadrennial political tradition. Johnson, for example, has been quoted everywhere from CNN to The Sydney Morning Herald. But all of those news stories left out one crucial detail: Johnson doesn't live in Dixville Notch. He used to, but he moved away when his property there got tied up in a contentious divorce case. He never updated his voter registration, however, because he always planned to go back. The way he saw it, it didn't make any difference where he was casting his ballot for president \u2014 as long as he wasn't voting in more than one place. \"Does it make any difference when I vote for Donald Trump, whether I vote in Campton, N.H., or Newport, N.H., or Dixville Notch, N.H.?\" Johnson said. \"As far as I know, it doesn't make one damn bit of difference at all.\" New Hampshire voting law allows someone who has taken a \"temporary absence\" from a community to continue voting in that place if they intend to return. But state officials say Johnson's case went beyond the boundaries of that statute, and they ordered him to stop voting in Dixville Notch unless he puts back down roots there.

Hale in 1895, is shown March 24, 2006, in Dixville Notch, N.H. Johnson isn't the only Dixville Notch voter who raised concern among state officials. Investigators also questioned the eligibility of people who voted in Dixville Notch while living there part time to work on a project to reopen The Balsams Grand Resort Hotel, a shuttered hotel that once served as the lifeblood of the community and the backdrop for the midnight voting tradition. Some former employees of the Balsams, who were displaced when it closed down in 2011, also got warnings from the state for voting in Dixville Notch after moving elsewhere. The man in charge of overseeing Dixville Notch's elections, Tom Tillotson, said all of the people singled out by state investigators had genuine connections to his community \u2014 and therefore, he had no regrets about allowing them to vote there. \"My god, when we have less than 50 percent of the people in this country voting, we should be doing everything to enfranchise and empower people to vote, not disenfranchise, which is what seems to be happening,\" Tillotson said. (New Hampshire's turnout in 2018 was 54.6 percent, slightly above the national average of 50.3 percent, according to the United States Elections Project.) But looking ahead to 2020, Dixville Notch is facing an even more existential problem than questions about its residency standards: It's running out of people to run its elections. There were just five people left on the voter rolls last fall, but the state says Dixville Notch needs to fill seven positions to stay in compliance and only some of those roles can overlap. Tillotson is optimistic that Dixville Notch can find a way to scrape together the roster it needs in time for next year's presidential elections. But he also knows the clock is ticking \u2014 and even he acknowledges, \"it's getting to be a ghost town here.\"",

Gavin Newsom walks up up the center aisle of the Assembly chambers to deliver his first of the State of the State Tuesday in Sacramento, Calif. In his first State of the State speech Tuesday, California Gov. Gavin Newsom wasted no time in criticizing what he called President Trump's \"fear-mongering\" over the \"so-called 'border emergency'\" as a \"manufactured crisis\" and \"political theater.\" \"The answer to the White House, with all due respect: No more division, no more xenophobia and no more nativism,\" he said, one day after signing an order removing most California National Guard troops from the Mexican border. In the speech, Newsom also announced plans to scale back California's bullet train, and talked about combating the state's surge in wildfires, the bankruptcy of its largest utility in PG&E, public school funding and expanding health care coverage. In addition to immigration, the governor criticized the White House on health care as \"laser-focused \u2014 has been for years \u2014 on destroying the Affordable Care Act,\" blaming the end of the individual mandate to purchase insurance coverage for a sharp increase in premiums on California's state-run health care exchange. Newsom wants to create a state individual mandate, using the money it raises to expand subsidies on the exchange to middle-class Californians. He also wants to expand California's Medicaid program, Medi-Cal, to immigrants under age 26 living in the state illegally. (California children are already covered, regardless of immigration status.) But the only time the governor mentioned Trump's name was to praise him. \"I want to thank President Trump for calling attention to prescription drug prices last week in his State of the Union,\" Newsom said, noting he's ordered his administration to begin working toward a single-purchasing system that he argues will cut costs. \"This is a bipartisan issue \u2014 at least it should be \u2014 and I hope he follows through, and takes the lead of California in the process,\" he said. Announcing he'll scale back the state's bullet train project, a signature of his predecessors, Newsom said, \"Let's be real: The current project, as planned, would cost too much and take too long.\" The $77 billion high-speed rail line was first approved by voters in 2008, when the projected cost was $33 billion. The project's price tag at one point hit $99 billion. Specifically, the governor proposed delaying construction of a train connecting Los Angeles and San Francisco \u2014 let alone the larger goal of Sacramento to San Diego \u2014 and instead focus on a route between the smaller Central Valley cities of Bakersfield and Merced. He acknowledged critics would ding this move as a \"train to nowhere, but I think that's wrong and I think that's offensive.\" \"Let's get something done once and for all,\" he said, arguing the Central Valley should not be left out of the project's \"economic transformation.\" One of the nation's most powerful Republicans signaled an openness to Newsom's announcement. \"I look forward to working w/ Governor Newsom and federal officials in the coming weeks to best mitigate what has already been wasted on high-speed rail due to the previous Administration,\" tweeted House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy. But other Republicans scorned the governor for trying to have it both ways. \"He admitted it has been a failure, but he committed to keep spending billions on the failed project\" by changing it to \"a Central Valley commuter train,\" state Sen. Jeff Stone said in a statement. \"That's not what people were promised, and the project should be killed outright.\" Newsom's announcement seemed to confuse supporters and critics alike, prompting his administration to clarify that the Central Valley segment's prioritization does not mean the abandonment of the entire project. \"Importantly, [the governor] also reaffirmed our commitment to complete the environmental work statewide, to meet our 'bookend' investments in the Bay Area and Los Angeles and to pursue additional federal and private funding for future project expansion,\" California High-Speed Rail Authority CEO Brian Kelly said in a statement. And in a tweet, the governor's chief of staff, Ann O'Leary, said Newsom \"fully committed to high speed rail as part of All in California economic transformation, and clean energy future.\" In his address \u2014 which lasted nearly 45 minutes, more than twice the length of the average State of the State speech by former governors Jerry Brown and Arnold Schwarzenegger \u2014 he also signaled support for a single Delta tunnel. It's a reduction of former Gov. Brown's vision for two tunnels along the Sacramento River that would transfer water to Southern California, but one already under consideration during the waning weeks of the Brown administration. \"The status quo is not an option,\" the governor said of the contentious project. \"Our collective effort must be to cross the finish line on real agreements to save the Sacramento-San Joaquin Bay Delta.\" Newsom ended his address with the story of registered nurse Allyn Pierce, who braved the flames of the Camp Fire in Paradise, Calif. to help treat and evacuate patients from the town's hospital. \"Taking care of each other, showing courage when it matters most \u2014 this is what we do in California,\" the governor said after recognizing Pierce in the Assembly gallery. \"Yes, we have much left to do, but I believe in the remarkable talent assembled here, and I believe in our state. And I know this, in the bottom of my heart: The best is yet to come.\"",

Updated 4:14 p.m. ET President Trump said on Tuesday that he's not \"happy\" with a potential budget deal being worked out by congressional negotiators but added that he doesn't think there will be another partial government shutdown. \"I have to study it,\" Trump told reporters during a Cabinet meeting at the White House. \"I'm not happy about it. It's not doing the trick. ... Am I happy at first glance? I just got to see it. The answer is no, I'm not happy.\" He said that he would be \"adding things to it.\" He continued, \"I don't think you're going to see a shutdown. ... If you did have it, it's the Democrats' fault.\" Details of the deal are still being finalized, but broad outlines include nearly $1.4 billion for 55 miles of physical barriers at the border and a limit of about 40,000 detention beds at Immigration and Customs Enforcement facilities. Currently, ICE has capacity for just over 49,000 detentions. The deal is a breakthrough after talks broke down during the weekend over the number of people ICE could detain, which is tied to the number of beds it is allowed. Democrats wanted an even lower cap on the number of beds, arguing that this would force ICE to focus on criminals and those who are truly violent. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., praised the compromise and urged Trump to sign it. \"I think he's got a pretty good deal here,\" McConnell said. \"I think he's done just fine, and I hope he'll conclude that, because he has to sign the bill.\" Still, it remains unclear if Trump will accept the compromise, especially since ahead of the previous partial shutdown, on Dec. 22, Trump had seemed inclined to back a funding bill but then changed his mind amid blowback from conservatives. The amount for physical barriers, after all, does not come close to the amount the president has been demanding for a wall \u2014 $5.7 billion. The government will partially shut down again early Saturday if a deal is not reached. McConnell hasn't asked Trump yet for a commitment to sign the bill, given that final details and text are still being worked out, but the Senate's leading Republican said, \"If it becomes what we think it is, I do recommend he sign it.\" Speaking at a campaign rally Monday night soon after news of the agreement broke, the president suggested the deal reached by lawmakers was not the end of the discussion about a border wall. \"We probably have some good news,\" Trump said, somewhat unenthusiastically, in El Paso, Texas, before adding, \"I don't even want to hear about it. ...  Just so you know, we're building the wall anyway.\" Talking directly to his base at the rally, he said, \"It was between the deal and you, and I had to choose you.\" Many conservatives have decried the bill. Fox News host Sean Hannity called the potential deal \"garbage.\" Rep. Jim Jordan, R-Ohio, of the conservative Freedom Caucus tweeted that it was a \"bad deal.\" While the President was giving a great speech in El Paso, Congress was putting together a bad deal on immigration.#DoWhatWeSaid It's possible that Trump could sign the bill, then take executive action, declare a national emergency or somehow move funds around to continue building a wall. \"I'm considering everything,\" Trump said at the Cabinet meeting on Tuesday, not ruling in or out any option. Trump noted that regardless of what happens with the budget deal, a Southern border wall will be built. \"It's all going to happen,\" Trump said. \"We're going to build a big, beautiful, strong wall.\" Asked about the president trying to use other authority, such as an emergency declaration, to spend additional money outside of the deal to build a barrier along the Southwest border, McConnell \u2014 who has urged Trump not to go that route \u2014 simply said that Trump \"ought to feel free to use whatever tools he can legally use to enhance his effort to secure the border.\" Senate Appropriations Committee Chairman Richard Shelby, R-Ala., one of the architects of the deal, called it a \"down payment\" for border barriers. \"Build the Wall\" was a 2016 campaign theme on placards and was chanted at Trump rallies. Signs that now say \"Finish the Wall\" are a fixture of his re-election rallies. Seemingly acknowledging his political base, Trump said at the Cabinet meeting, \"We're building a wall. Now I'm saying, 'We're finishing a wall.' \"",

There's a huge 2020 Democratic field forming for the chance to take on President Trump. Two more candidates officially announced over the weekend \u2013 Sens. Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota and Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts. And while those two potentially embody the core split within the Democratic primary \u2013 pragmatism vs. pugilism \u2013 Trump will be waiting in the general election with another distinction he hopes to make: \"socialism\" vs. \"greatness.\" \"The Democrat Party has never been more outside of the mainstream,\" Trump said in El Paso, Texas, on Monday night in what was his first campaign rally of 2019. \"They're becoming the party of socialism, late-term abortion, open borders and crime.\" It's a message he began trying out a week ago during his State of the Union address. He tied the unrest in Venezuela to domestic U.S. politics. \"Here in the United States, we are alarmed by the new calls to adopt socialism in our country,\" he said. \"America was founded on liberty and independence, and not government coercion, domination and control. We are born free, and we will stay free. Tonight, we renew our resolve that America will never be a socialist country.\" The denunciation of socialism and the attempt to tie the philosophy to Democrats is Trump's and his campaign's attempt to invert the argument that he is an extremist. The president's sluggish approval rating means he is going to have to try and pull Democrats down with him \u2014 and given that surveys also show he would lose at this point to a generic Democrat, Trump also needs to show their candidates to be unelectable and out of step with the rest of America. \"He's the first president to never crack 50 [percent approval] in his first two years,\" said Bruce Mehlman, a Republican strategist and attorney who worked as an assistant secretary in the Commerce Department for technology policy. \"The resistance is really energized, and that's part of why you saw the highest midterm turnout since 1914 last November. The economy has been really strong, but it's showing some worrisome signs. Mr. Mueller's report and/or Democratic oversight will likely make the waters choppier. And voters want change.\" Republicans tried a version of Trump's inversion strategy to no avail in the 2018 midterm elections. They tried to paint Democrats as wanting to abolish ICE (the Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency) and create single-payer health care. Republicans said if the election turned out to be about that, as opposed to a more nuanced discussion of border security and pre-existing conditions, they felt they could win or hold their own. It didn't happen. Instead, in an election where Trump was front of mind, Democrats won over suburban voters and independents, and took back the House by flipping 40 seats. In 2020, Trump gets to try to make the argument himself. And people close to him think he can make a winning one. \"At the end of the day, politics and elections are typically binary choices,\" said Andy Surabian, who worked in the 2016 Trump campaign war room, was political director for Tea Party Express and is now a political adviser to Donald Trump Jr. \"The biggest gift to Trump is for Democrats to nominate what I call a 'kneeler,' someone who supports kneeling for the national anthem.\" Mehlman added: \"If the Dems are able to nominate a presidential nominee that appeals to the middle of the country, that's going to be very powerful. But if they go hard left, there is a path for Donald Trump to get re-elected.\" It is, in theory, an advantage a president has when he's up for re-election with a locked-down base and no primary opposition \u2014 yet. His potential Democratic opponents will have to outflank each other, and that often can mean being the most stridently progressive (or conservative, in GOP primaries). The new debate over \"socialism\" Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., speaks at a campaign rally at the University of Iowa on Sunday.\n                \n                    \n                    Scott Olson/Getty Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., speaks at a campaign rally at the University of Iowa on Sunday. Already, many of the Democrats running or thinking about it are embracing Medicare-for-all and the Green New Deal. Both of those ideas have been put forward by the party's two highest-profile democratic socialists \u2014 Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, an independent who caucuses with the Democrats, and New York Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. This is a fairly new debate to be taking place within the mainstream of the Democratic Party rather than at the fringes. Sanders caught fire in the 2016 primary race and gave a surprisingly strong challenge to Democratic front-runner Hillary Clinton. Sanders didn't prevail, but the boldness of his ideas did. It's going to be interesting to see how Democrats walk and define the line when it comes to socialism. The word makes many Americans \u2014 and some Democrats, especially older ones \u2014 uncomfortable. A remarkable shift has happened in just the past decade, since the 2008 financial collapse \u2014 more Democrats now have a positive view of the word \"socialism\" (57 percent) than \"capitalism\" (43 percent), Gallup found last year. Loading... Don't see the graphic? Click here. That diverges from the country overall, as only slightly more than a third (37 percent) of Americans have a positive view of socialism. Socialism also rates lowest when people are asked about it in a list that includes small business, entrepreneurs, free enterprise, capitalism, big business and even the federal government. Since Trump's election, however, socialism is the only one on that list to gain popularity. There is a huge generational divide: A majority of young people, those aged 18 to 29, see socialism positively and have a dimmer view of capitalism. Older Americans have a more sharply negative view of the term \u2014 41 percent of those aged 30 to 49, 30 percent of those aged 50 to 64 and just 28 percent of those 65 and older view it positively. This younger generation, after all, are not Cold War kids. Someone who is 29 was born the year before the fall of the Iron Curtain. The word socialism just doesn't have the same meaning for them as for those who lived through the nearly 50-year, post-World War II arms race with the Soviet Union and the underlying debate over the ideal society. Loading... Don't see the graphic above? Click here. As viewed by Americans, that debate was between the free, capitalistic West on one side and the repressive communism and socialism of the USSR on the other. Some Democrats are trying to find more nuance. Sen. Brian Schatz of Hawaii, for example, sparked an interesting debate on the left with his tweet that he's \"not a socialist\" but does \"believe that every American deserves health care,\" that \"college should be debt free, and that America must lead boldly on climate change.\" I\u2019m not a socialist. But I believe that every American deserves health care. I also believe that college should be debt free, and that America must lead boldly on climate change. That doesn\u2019t mean I want America to be Venezuela. It means I want America to be America. And Schatz may be on to something. When younger voters respond positively to \"socialism\" in polls, they're not saying they want the country to become like Venezuela or Cuba. To them, \"socialism\" is synonymous with a strong social safety net and an economy where big banks and billionaires pay \u2014 proportionately \u2014 their fair share in taxes. President Trump is moving aggressively to define the Democrats as old-fashioned, Cold War-style socialists. Now, it's up to the Democrats to define what it is they are for. Much of the difference comes down to semantics \u2014 the wording and view of what socialism really is. The problem, though, is nuance doesn't usually play well in campaigns, especially in primaries.",

President Trump delivered a wide-ranging State of the Union address Tuesday night that went an hour and 21 minutes. That's the third-longest ever. So what should we make of Trump's third address to Congress, and in a year when Democrats are gearing up for a crowded primary to decide who will face Trump in 2020? 1. Trump did not acknowledge the new political reality in Washington Each of the past four presidents, including Trump, had lost the House at some point during their presidency. And every one of them that came before Trump \u2014 Bill Clinton in 1995, George W. Bush in 2007 and Barack Obama in 2011 \u2014 nodded to that change. Not Trump. Instead, he barreled ahead with pitching his agenda. 2. The speech was like whiplash The president had some bipartisan overtures \u2014 talking about a recently enacted criminal justice law, paid family leave, lowering prescription drug costs and dangling, once again, infrastructure. But the speech went from optimistic vagueries (\"Our most thrilling achievements are still ahead\") to misleading fears (calling a new caravan of Central American immigrants a \"tremendous onslaught\" and describing the Southern U.S. border as \"very dangerous\" and \"lawless.\" NPR fact-checked the claims here.) And Trump even fired this warning shot at Democrats about whether anything will get done: \"If there is going to be peace and legislation, there cannot be war and investigation.\" House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., took that as a threat, saying in a statement after the speech: \"[H]e threatened the United States Congress not to exercise its constitutional responsibility of oversight.\" 3. There was news on North Korea The only real bit of news in the speech was that Trump announced he would be meeting with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un for a second summit Feb. 27-28 in Vietnam. But the president also raised eyebrows, claiming that if he hadn't been elected, \"we would right now, in my opinion, be in a major war with North Korea.\" Oddly, Trump both overstates (\"major war\" potential) and understates (it hasn't denuclearized) the threat posed by North Korea. 4. There wasn't any progress on avoiding another shutdown The president spent a good chunk of the speech on immigration. He argued in favor of a wall: \"Simply put, walls work, and walls save lives.\" And he did not seem like someone ready to negotiate on a wall or border security funding to avoid a shutdown. \"My administration has sent to Congress a common sense proposal to end the crisis on the Southern border,\" Trump said. \"It includes humanitarian assistance, more law enforcement, drug detection at our ports, closing loopholes that enable child smuggling and plans for a new physical barrier or wall to secure the vast areas between our ports of entry. In the past, most of the people in this room voted for a wall, but the proper wall never got built. I will get it built.\" Trump also did not mention federal workers or the government shutdown in the speech. So it appears, unless something drastic changes, the country is headed for either another partial shutdown or the president will declare a national emergency. 5. He's running; Trump's speech was aimed at creating a choice between himself and Democrats Big sections of the speech felt like 2020 messaging. He was reinforcing his base, not just in talking about immigration, but he also denounced abortion in some of his strongest language (using the word \"execute,\" for example). It was also strongly pro-Israel and stressed national security. When he talked about Venezuela, he used it as an opportunity to tie it back to a criticism of Democrats domestically: \"Here, in the United States, we are alarmed by new calls to adopt socialism in our country. America was founded on liberty and independence \u2014 not government coercion, domination and control. We are born free, and we will stay free. Tonight, we renew our resolve that America will never be a socialist country.\" Trump's speech was billed as one of unity, but he subtly inserted campaign slogans and created a binary choice between him and Democrats, between \"greatness\" and \"resistance.\" \"We must choose between greatness or gridlock, results or resistance, vision or vengeance, incredible progress or pointless destruction,\" Trump said early on in his address. \"Tonight, I ask you to choose greatness.\" He came back to that theme at the end with another campaign theme: \"I am asking you to choose greatness ... we must keep America first in our hearts.\" 6. Democratic women were a show of force Democratic women, dressed all in white in honor of suffragettes, react as President Trump notes the record number of women in Congress.\n                \n                    \n                    Mandel Ngan /AFP/Getty Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption Democratic women, dressed all in white in honor of suffragettes, react as President Trump notes the record number of women in Congress. One of the moments of levity in the speech was when Trump noted: \"No one has benefited more from our thriving economy than women who have filled 58 percent of the newly created jobs last year.\" That prompted Democratic women, clad in white outfits in honor of suffragettes, to let out a Bronx cheer. After all, women were a major reason why Democrats took back the House last year. The irony seemed lost on the president, who remarked, \"You weren't supposed to do that.\" Trump then noted, \"We also have more women serving in Congress than at any time before.\" But that is entirely because of Democratic women. The numbers of Republican women in Congress actually went down after the 2018 elections. 7. Stacey Abrams fared pretty well Delivering the response to the State of the Union has been a tough task over the years, but Georgia Democrat Stacey Abrams held up. There was no awkward walk down stairs, no desperate reaches for water and no fumbles. She made her case, slammed Trump over the recent partial shutdown and even said she didn't hope for his failure. The bottom line is Abrams, who narrowly lost her bid for governor in 2018, did nothing to dissuade Democrats from wanting her to run for the U.S. Senate seat in Georgia in 2020.",

            "article_content": "President Trump will deliver his State of the Union address Tuesday night to Congress and the nation. It's his first major speech as the 2020 election cycle gets under way.  STEVE INSKEEP, HOST: You can think of tonight's State of the Union speech as a civic ritual. An update on the state of the union is required by the Constitution, and almost everybody who's anybody in government will be there. But this is also the president's first major speech as the 2020 election cycle gets under way. NPR national political correspondent Mara Liasson looks at Trump's position as he gears up for re-election. MARA LIASSON, BYLINE: Less than two years away from facing the voters again, Donald Trump is stuck. His approval rating, around 40 percent, is steady but not very high. And in several new polls, majorities of voters say they will definitely not vote for him in 2020. Republican strategist Bruce Mehlman says Trump still has a good economy working for him, but he is facing a lot of headwinds. BRUCE MEHLMAN: He's the first president to never crack 50 in his first two years. The resistance is really energized, and that's part of why you saw the highest midterm turnout since 1914 last November. The economy has been really strong, but it's showing some worrisome signs. Mr. Mueller's report, and or Democratic oversight, will likely make the waters choppier. And voters want change. LIASSON: Voters want change, and they voted for change in eight of the last 10 federal elections. In 2016, Trump was the change candidate. He made two core promises. One, to be a fighter, to stick to his principles, and when attacked, punch back twice as hard. He's been true to that first promise. But the second one, says political analyst Amy Walter, not so much. AMY WALTER: The second was, because I'm not a politician, I can get stuff done because I don't follow those silly old rules that those career politicians follow. He's going to be a dealmaker. And not only has that not worked, but he seems to be actively working against making that work. LIASSON: On top of the stinging rebuke Trump suffered in the midterm elections, there was his bruising losing fight over the government shutdown, triggered by his insistence that Congress fund his border wall. Polls show more voters blame Trump than Democrats for the shutdown for government's failure to perform even its most basic functions. Republican pollster John McLaughlin, who worked on Trump's 2016 campaign, says the president still has the support of his base, but... JOHN MCLAUGHLIN: He needs to raise his job approval. He needs to bring in more people into his voter coalition. I think the Democrats are trying to contain him because if he gets over 50 percent job approval, as President Obama did, as George W. Bush did, he will get re-elected. LIASSON: Can Trump climb out of the hole he has mostly dug for himself? Yes, says former Bush administration official Lanhee Chen. Chen says Trump still has plenty of time even though he is currently in a tenuous position. LANHEE CHEN: I don't think it's a tenuous position without any exit. I think he's got some opportunity to bridge the gap, to raise support amongst independents and moderates. And should he keep that base support, I think he would be a formidable candidate going into the 2020 cycle. LIASSON: Chen thinks the formula for Trump is to keep fighting for the wall but also go beyond it and offer some olive branches to Democrats. Tonight, for instance, Trump will put forward some policies Democrats could support - an infrastructure plan and a way to curb prescription drug prices. CHEN: That might be a way for him to garner additional support amongst more moderate voters that potentially are disaffected by the way he's treating the immigration debate. LIASSON: Even though many of the president's advisers are concerned that he starts the 2020 cycle with a lot of self-inflicted wounds, they console themselves with one important fact. A re-election campaign is not only a referendum on the incumbent. Andy Surabian worked in the Trump White House. Now he's a political adviser to Donald Trump Jr. ANDY SURABIAN: At the end of the day, politics and elections are typically binary choices, and the biggest gift to Trump is for Democrats to nominate what I call a kneeler, someone who supports kneeling for the national anthem. LIASSON: In other words, someone on the liberal side of the culture wars that President Trump loves to fight. The Democrats' recent missteps over late-term abortion and the left-wing tilt of the current Democratic field is fueling those Republican hopes. But, says Bruce Mehlman... MEHLMAN: If the Dems are able to nominate a presidential nominee that appeals to the middle of the country, that's going to be very powerful. But if they go hard left, there is a path for Donald Trump to get re-elected. LIASSON: And that's why the president, a master marketer who believes in the power of repetition to brand himself or his opponents, has been saying this over and over again. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Super-left Democrats, the radical Democrats, what's going on in that party is shocking. The Democrats had become radicalized. It's radical. Democrats, they've become a radicalized - they really have. They have become a radicalized party. LIASSON: And that was just in the span of one day. The president clearly has 2020 on his mind. He's talking about it, and he's tweeting about it. And tonight, he'll have the biggest audience he'll have all year to not just define the Democrats but to lay out an affirmative case for himself.

            "article_content": "The border wall fight has swamped President Trump's agenda ahead of the State of the Union address. Aides say he has other priorities, but it's unclear if they're achievable in this political climate.  ARI SHAPIRO, HOST: President Trump will deliver his second State of the Union address tomorrow night in the House chamber. The event had been scheduled for a week ago, but then the partial government shutdown happened. As NPR's Tamara Keith reports, the fight over the border wall that was at the heart of that shutdown still looms large. TAMARA KEITH, BYLINE: For the record-setting 35 days of the partial government shutdown, there was really just one thing on President Trump's agenda. (SOUNDBITE OF MONTAGE) PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: We're going to have a wall. And we need a wall very soon. And we're building the new wall as we speak. We're building the wall right now as we speak. If we had a wall, we wouldn't have any problems. We have to have the wall. Walls are not immoral. Nothing like a wall. KEITH: The wall dominated all else. Even in Iraq to greet the troops the day after Christmas, President Trump brought up the wall and border security. For days on end, all alone at the White House, as he put it, Trump had no meetings or public events on his schedule. There were no new policy rollouts, no theme weeks. RON BONJEAN: The wall is actually a wall against getting anything else done (laughter) at this point. I mean, it's literally a legislative wall. KEITH: Ron Bonjean is a Republican strategist who has worked with the Trump administration. And while the wall and shutdown have been nearly all-consuming for Trump, he points out it temporarily stymied the ambitious agenda of House Democrats, too. The president's State of the Union address comes at an unsettled time politically with the clock ticking down for Trump and Congress to reach a deal on border security funding. And it gives Trump a big moment on the national stage to make his pitch. But for what? Bonjean says he expects Trump to throw down the gauntlet on the wall to prove that even if he lost round one, he doesn't intend to lose round two. BONJEAN: He has to demand funding for his wall. I mean, it would be malpractice for him not to. At the same time, Americans want to hear much more than immigration. They want to hear solutions to health care, to infrastructure, to data privacy, foreign policy. You know, you name it. KEITH: These are the sorts of things President Trump talked about in the press conference he held the day after the midterms. (SOUNDBITE OF PRESS CONFERENCE) TRUMP: Hopefully we can all work together next year to continue delivering for the American people, including on economic growth, infrastructure, trade, lowering the cost of prescription drugs. These are some of the things that the Democrats do want to work on. KEITH: White House advisers say these potentially bipartisan items will make an appearance in Trump's State of the Union. But in the midst of all this partisan rancor, can President Trump actually walk into the House chamber, stand right in front of Speaker Nancy Pelosi and act as if this is a normal address in a normal time? Another president 20 years ago did just that. (SOUNDBITE OF STATE OF THE UNION ADDRESS) BILL CLINTON: Because of the hard work and high purpose of the American people, these are good times for America. KEITH: In 1998, President Clinton's State of the Union simply ignored the Monica Lewinsky scandal swirling around his presidency, says Russell Riley with the Miller Center at the University of Virginia. RUSSELL RILEY: By dent of his speaking skills and his personality, he was able to go in and change the tone of the debate. There were a lot of people within the Clinton White House that felt that that saved his presidency. KEITH: It's not the same situation, but Riley says this speech does present an opportunity for Trump. RILEY: Really to kind of reset his presidency if he chooses to do it. He may not. He may find that this is an opportunity to go in and to aggravate emotions over the border wall. KEITH: Or he could do what almost every other president has done in these addresses and talk about finding common ground. RILEY: A strategic-thinking White House operation, if it were effectively working for the president, would convince them that it's better at this point to go in and start trying to get some wins on the board looking ahead to his re-election season. KEITH: It may be too late and too toxic for bipartisan cooperation. Many of the president's allies are convinced Democrats are unwilling to give him a victory on anything large or small just because Trump is Trump. And Trump is so focused on keeping his base with him he may have a hard time compromising with them. Tamara Keith, NPR News. Copyright \u00a9 2019 NPR.  All rights reserved.

            "article_content": "What do Republican and independent voters in Colorado make of President Trump's ongoing call for a border wall? We talk to voters in the Denver suburbs.  RACHEL MARTIN, HOST: It was on. Then it was off. And now that the government shutdown is over, at least for the time being, President Trump's State of the Union address is back on again. The government was shut down because of the debate over a border wall with Mexico, which President Trump is still pushing for. So what do Americans make of all this? NPR's Don Gonyea has been talking to voters in the Denver suburbs. DON GONYEA, BYLINE: This state was once considered a classic political battleground, but it's been going more and more Democratic in statewide elections. Our first stop, Aurora, a sprawling suburb just east of Denver. Forty-seven-year-old Bob Nelson stopped to talk outside a local supermarket. He described himself as apolitical and no fan of Republicans or Democrats. And he did not vote for Trump. I asked him about the border wall. BOB NELSON: I understand the need for border security, but we do not have a crisis - the crisis that he's imagining. GONYEA: Nelson nods to a past Republican president, Ronald Reagan, who in 1986 worked with Congress to pass an immigration law that granted amnesty to immigrants who had entered the country illegally. NELSON: So the - what we need is people who actually talk to each other again. GONYEA: Also outside the grocery store, 35-year-old Jessica Polacek. She's a government accountant who was furloughed during the shutdown. Polacek also describes herself as an independent politically. She voted for Trump but, these days, says she's just fed up with politics. Are you going to watch the State of the Union? JESSICA POLACEK: Probably not. GONYEA: Why not? POLACEK: Because it's politics. It's arguing no matter what (laughter). GONYEA: She says she doesn't know if she agrees or disagrees with the idea of a border wall but thinks it's not something to shut the government down over. She's pessimistic that another shutdown can be avoided. She does not want the president to declare a national emergency to get the wall. POLACEK: The point of government is checks and balances, and claiming a national emergency is just saying, well, you don't agree with me; I'm going to do what I want anyway. And that I don't like. GONYEA: Now to a part of the Denver suburbs that is still very Republican. (CROSSTALK) GONYEA: This is an early morning meeting of the local GOP group in a downtown diner in the city of Parker. It's in Douglas County. You can hear the frustration over Colorado's changing politics. Sixty-three-year-old Pat Bygott is a businessman and geophysicist in Parker. PAT BYGOTT: Well, simply, it's going from conservative to progressive liberal dramatically. GONYEA: Bygott, a self-described constitutional conservative, is very happy with his vote for Trump. So, too, is 58-year-old Tressa Server who runs a small e-commerce business and who volunteers at the local food bank. Server says at times, she feels vilified for her political beliefs. TRESSA SERVER: A large part of the reason we're defensive is the media. I mean, as we're learning now, if you wear a MAGA hat, that means you're a racist. GONYEA: Or, she says, you're labeled homophobic or sexist or misogynist. SERVER: No, we're not. And - but it puts us on the defense 'cause we're being attacked daily on our beliefs. Just because we associate with a candidate or just because we associate with an issue doesn't mean we're racist or sexist. Maybe we just have another way of looking at something. GONYEA: For her part, Server will be watching the president tomorrow night. Still, you can hear the anxiety in her voice over the nature of our politics today. Whether it's stress or frustration or just worrying about where this is all going, it's something that each of these voters seemed to share whether they support the president or not.

The Pentagon is fulfilling a Department of Homeland Security request to assist Customs and Border Protection.  ARI SHAPIRO, HOST: The Pentagon is sending thousands more active-duty troops to the U.S.-Mexico border. Orders were signed today for an initial deployment of 2,400 troops with more to follow. NPR Pentagon correspondent Tom Bowman joins us now with more. Hi, Tom. TOM BOWMAN, BYLINE: Hey, Ari. SHAPIRO: Is this a surprise? BOWMAN: You know, it really isn't. Acting Defense Secretary Patrick Shanahan raised the issue publicly at a White House meeting a few weeks back. And, of course, troops were first sent to the border last year in the run-up to the midterm elections. Now, the numbers have since come down, but the Department of Homeland Security asked the Pentagon for more assistance. So today, orders were signed for another 2,400 active-duty troops to be sent to the border within a couple of weeks, another 1,100 active troops within a month. And they'll join the active-duty troops there already, about 2,300, with the Guard troops there, another 2,100. And they'll be stringing concertina wire, providing mobile surveillance transport for Customs and Border Protection. SHAPIRO: Why does the Trump administration say these troops are needed right now? BOWMAN: Well, there's a lot of wire to string, a lot of razor wire - 150 to 160 miles mostly in California and Arizona. And the additional active troops will bring the numbers back up to the original force of almost 6,000 that were deployed last fall. Now, President Trump says the numbers of migrants heading to the border - it's a crisis, a threat to national security. He said it's an invasion. But there's a lot of skepticism in D.C. and along the border about whether this is necessary. And also at the Pentagon, people I talk with say, listen; this is a waste of money. You don't use active-duty troops for this. You can use - they don't believe there is a crisis or an invasion. They say you can use some Guard troops for this. And, of course, all of this is happening in the midst of a fierce debate about whether to provide funding for the border wall President Trump wants to build. SHAPIRO: Right. Members of Congress are negotiating on that right now. How do they play into all of this? BOWMAN: Well, members of Congress - two days ago, there were - Pentagon officials testified before the House Armed Services Committee about military assistance at the border. John Rood, who's the undersecretary of defense for policy, was there. And he basically didn't mention anything about these additional troops heading to the border. And today, the chairman of the committee, Democrat Adam Smith of Washington state, put out this blistering statement. He said he only learned about the deployment by making a phone call to acting Defense Secretary Patrick Shanahan, although Shanahan mentioned it at a press briefing. I actually asked him about this. Are you going to send more troops? He said a few thousand. So Adam Smith, the congressman, put out a statement saying, quote, \"this was at best an error in judgment and at worst flat-out dishonesty by Pentagon officials.\" SHAPIRO: That's NPR Pentagon correspondent Tom Bowman on the deployment of thousands more troops to the U.S.-Mexico border.

With the government reopened \u2014 at least for now \u2014 following a 35-day partial government shutdown, President Trump's State of the Union address has been rescheduled for Tuesday, Feb. 5. In a letter sent to the president on Monday, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., wrote that the two had agreed upon the new date next week, after she had postponed her original offer of Jan. 29 amid the shutdown. \"When I wrote to you on January 23rd, I stated that we should work together to find a mutually agreeable date when government has reopened to schedule this year's State of the Union address. In our conversation today, we agreed on February 5th,\" Pelosi wrote. \"Therefore, I invite you to deliver your State of the Union address before a Joint Session of Congress on February 5, 2019 in the House Chamber. Thank you for your attention to this matter.\" Trump responded with a letter of his own, accepting the new invitation. \"Thank you for your letter inviting me to deliver the State of the Union Address before a joint session of Congress on Tuesday, February 5, 2019,\" the president wrote to Pelosi. \"It is my great honor to accept. We have a great story to tell and yet, great goals to achieve! I look forward to seeing you on the 5th.\" The annual address to Congress was a casualty of the longest government shutdown in U.S. history, which finally ended Friday. Earlier this month, Pelosi wrote to Trump rescinding her initial offer of Jan. 29, citing security concerns as both the Secret Service and Department of Homeland Security officials were working without pay during the partial shutdown. Trump initially pushed back, tweeting that \"It would be so very sad for our Country if the State of the Union were not delivered on time, on schedule, and very importantly, on location!\" The White House was also reportedly looking at other locations for the major speech, but then last Wednesday, Trump agreed with Pelosi that his address should wait until the government was reopened. \"[There] is no venue that can compete with the history, tradition and importance of the House Chamber,\" the president tweeted. \"I look forward to giving a 'great' State of the Union Address in the near future!\" Trump's speech is likely to focus heavily on immigration and his continued push for a wall along the Mexican border \u2014 which was the sticking point in spending negotiations that led to the partial shutdown in the first place. But the president backed down on Friday; Trump agreed with congressional leaders to reopen the government for three weeks as negotiations over funding for border security and other aspects of immigration policy continue with a bipartisan group of lawmakers from both the House and the Senate. But if those talks don't produce a breakthrough or a compromise suitable to Trump, the country could be facing another partial shutdown, with funding for the agencies and departments that had been affected set to expire Feb. 15. Trump hinted as much in his speech in the Rose Garden last week, saying that if discussions don't result in funding for the wall or steel barrier he has made the hallmark of his administration, \"the government would either shut down again\" or he could declare a national emergency to build a Southern border wall. The national emergency route is something Trump has floated for weeks and is an idea sure to be challenged in court. \"I have a very powerful alternative, but I didn't want to use it at this time. Hopefully it will be unnecessary,\" Trump teased on Friday. White House press secretary Sarah Sanders didn't deny the possibility of another shutdown during a rare briefing on Monday with reporters. \"The president doesn't want to go through another shutdown. That's not the goal. The goal is border security and protecting the American people,\" Sanders said. \"Ideally, Democrats would take these next three weeks to negotiate in good faith, as they've indicated that they would, and come up with a deal that makes sense, that actually fixes the problem, so we don't have to go through that process.\"",

The longest government shutdown in U.S. history is finally over. The government is back open \u2014 at least until Feb. 15 \u2014 after President Trump announced Friday that he would be in favor of opening and funding it for three weeks while he and congressional negotiators try to work out a broader deal on immigration and border security. Congress then quickly acted to reopen the government Friday evening. There are no two ways about it \u2014 Trump caved. He blinked Wednesday night when he agreed with House Speaker Nancy Pelosi that he would not deliver the State of the Union address next week from the House chamber until the shutdown ends. Then, early Friday afternoon, after a day dominated by the news that his former political adviser Roger Stone was indicted as part of the Mueller Russia probe, Trump completely gave in. Why? The shutdown was taking a political toll on the president, and Democrats showed no signs of budging on negotiating over border wall funding while the government was shut down. So what did we learn from this standoff and what happens now? Here are seven takeaways: 1. Nancy Pelosi outmaneuvered Trump, and now she's strengthened It might be hard to remember, but there was a time \u2014 about a month and a half ago \u2014 when Nancy Pelosi was no sure bet to rise to speaker again. She had a restive group of Democratic freshmen, who wanted a younger generation of leaders to emerge for the party. Now, for most Democrats, there's probably no one else they could imagine in that role right now. Trump has seemed flummoxed on how to deal with Pelosi (or as he calls her, \"Nancy\") since the Dec. 11 meeting in the Oval Office \u2014 10 days before the shutdown began \u2014 with Pelosi and Democratic Senate leader Chuck Schumer. Pelosi was determined to make Trump understand that Congress is a co-equal branch of government, and now with this win, Trump, ironically, helped sew up Pelosi's place as a strong speaker. Call it growing pains for Trump, but he is having a difficult time adjusting to the new power dynamic in Washington, a consequence of Democrats taking back the House after the 2018 elections. 2. Trump has put himself in a box Before the shutdown, the president was all set to sign off on a short-term deal to keep the government open, but it wouldn't have included funding for a wall. And then came the backlash from some corners of conservative media. On Friday, there was again an outcry. Right-wing website Gateway Pundit's headline after Trump's speech: \"TRUMP CAVES! Ends Shutdown with NO BORDER WALL....\" Here's how the conspiratorial far-right news blog @GatewayPundit is playing this: \"TRUMP CAVES!\" Meanwhile, @FoxNews has a sunnier spin on this news: \"BACK IN BUSINESS.\" pic.twitter.com/5cb0wYWfdU Commentator Ann Coulter called him \"the biggest wimp ever to serve as President of the United States.\" Good news for George Herbert Walker Bush: As of today, he is no longer the biggest wimp ever to serve as President of the United States. The president responded to the outcry in a tweet: \"This was in no way a concession.\" It's highly unlikely that the base abandons Trump. Prior predictions of that have failed. And many callers Friday into conservative talk radio shows seemed to have the president's back. But Trump has done little to reach beyond his base in the two years since he has become president. He has alienated large portions of the country and has seen massive declines with the middle. His base might return, but his political skills are about to be tested, because he likely needs to mitigate some of the damage he's done with independents. And that's a box he built for himself. 3. Shutting down the government is more of a third rail for Trump than not building a wall Trump has been badly damaged during this partial shutdown \u2014 majorities have mostly blamed him instead of Democrats; his approval ratings have slipped, even with his base; and large numbers of people said shutting down the government for wall funding is not a good idea or strategy. There's a pause now, and there are three weeks to figure out a long-term solution, but will the president now be more cautious about shutting down the government? There's a reason there wasn't a shutdown for almost 20 years after the 1995-1996 shutdown, which is now the second-longest shutdown in history. 4. Is Trump laying the groundwork for a bold move? To that point, if there's no agreement in the next three weeks, will the president pull the trigger and invoke a \"national emergency\" to fund a wall? He noted that he could do so, during his speech Friday from the Rose Garden at the White House. \"I have a very powerful alternative,\" Trump said, \"but I didn't want to use it at this time.\" He added, \"I think we have a chance, yeah. I think we have a good chance [to get a deal]. We'll work with the Democrats and negotiate, and if we can't do that, then we'll do a \u2014 obviously we'll do the emergency because that's what it is, it's a national emergency.\" That could come with its own political consequences, and it might not hold up in court \u2013 another loss the president would like to avoid. 5. Do Democrats give at least some on a wall now that they got the government back open? House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer answer questions following an announced end to the partial government shutdown Friday.\n                \n                    \n                    Win McNamee/Getty Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer answer questions following an announced end to the partial government shutdown Friday. Democrats had been prepared to offer a big pot of money that could be as much as $5.7 billion or more for border security as part of funding for the Department of Homeland Security. That could have included money for new fencing or fixes, and Schumer indicated Friday that there are plenty of measures Democrats can support \u2014 drug screening, ports of entry security, humanitarian needs. But what is a wall, and how it can get built, is very much open to debate and interpretation. Pelosi was asked about wall money Friday after Trump's announcement, and she said: \"Have I not been clear on a wall? Ok. No, I've been very clear on the wall.\" She has, so far, said no to anything more than $1 for a \"wall.\" But can Democrats sustain saying \"no\" indefinitely? Polling, so far, has been very much on Democrats' side during the shutdown, but there was at least one number that should give them pause. CBS found that 52 percent believe Democrats should accept a budget that includes money for a wall. 6. Americans' eyes may have been opened some to just what government does During this shutdown, the costs and consequences of a shutdown have become clear. Federal employees and contractors across the country who weren't getting paid were directly affected. And there have been further ripples for the economy \u2013 think landlords and small businesses serving those workers worried about their own bills. Americans are generally disconnected from government, but large majorities said the shutdown \u2013 with trash piling over at national parks and closed D.C. museums \u2014 was \"embarrassing.\" 7. Expect lines of attack from 2020 Democrats Trump also gave 2020 Democrats openings \u2014 on competence and empathy. Trump's vacillations on the negotiations show him to be hardly The Art of the Deal protagonist he bills himself as. Trump Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross' comments that he didn't understand why some federal workers were going to food pantries and not taking out loans also handed Democrats a gift. \"It's really hard for some in the administration to understand how people live paycheck to paycheck and how marginal some of their existences are,\" Pelosi said Friday after Trump spoke. Expect Democrats eyeing the White House in 2020 to pick that up in similar ways on the campaign trail, painting the Trump administration as one of out-of-touch multimillionaires and billionaires (a central theme of Elizabeth Warren's early campaign messages). That's an image Republicans have had trouble shedding in past presidential years, and Ross' comments won't help.",

            "article_content": "There's still no end in sight for the partial shutdown of the government \u2014 or the line of politicians considering a presidential run in 2020. NPR's Ron Elving examines the latest political news.  SCOTT SIMON, HOST: We're going to go to NPR's senior editor and correspondent of the Washington Desk, Ron Elving, now to talk about this week and the continuing government shutdown. Ron, thanks so much for being with us. RON ELVING, BYLINE: Good to be with you, Scott. SIMON: How do you see what I think we can fairly refer to now as a face-off between President Trump and Speaker Pelosi? You know, you can't give the State of the Union address here. Well, then, you're not flying to Afghanistan. ELVING: We've seen face-offs before. President Bill Clinton and Speaker Newt Gingrich, 1995 and 1996. That shutdown drama was highly personalized, as well. And so part of what's going on here, aside from the wall and the workers, is establishing the relationship between the new leader of Congress, which is, after all, a coequal branch of the government, and the leader of the executive branch, the president. And she has been the Democratic leader now since 2002. She's been speaker before. And she thinks that she has accomplished a great deal, just as the president feels his political standing reflects the same. SIMON: Why don't we hear more from Mitch McConnell in the middle of this shutdown? ELVING: Because he doesn't want to get in the middle of this. He doesn't feel like he has to. He comes out on the Senate floor from time to time, and he speaks, and he tries not to make news. He doesn't want or need this. He's getting some heat from a handful of his Republican senators who are going to be on the ballot in 2020. And he just hasn't heard from enough of those yet. Most of the Senate Republicans don't want to bail on Trump. They think they can blame the media. They can blame the Democrats. So until that changes, McConnell is not likely to change. He's going to ride it out and survive. SIMON: The president said he plans to make a major announcement this afternoon on the southern - about the southern border and the shutdown. Do you have any ideas what we can expect? ELVING: We don't really. We don't know whether the president is going to directly respond to the shutdown or if he is going to take this opportunity to talk more about the BuzzFeed story you were just talking to David about or whether, most likely, he's going to focus on what he sees as the threat to the United States from its southern border, from the people who live to the south of our country. That seems to be the most likely thing, but we'll have to wait and see what the president has to say when he speaks to us this afternoon from the White House. SIMON: The president met with the North Korean delegation Friday, says there'll be a second meeting with Kim Jong Un. And he announced plans for a new missile defense system, including one in space. Does this president have the mandate or political standing right now to undertake such huge policies when his ability to hold office is under investigation? ELVING: You know, Scott, he has the office, and he has the authority and the will, so he needs to go forward on these things because that's his job and also because he needs people to see him doing it on a world stage. This morning, the president has gone to Dover, Del., to meet the aircraft that's returning the remains of the U.S. servicemen killed this past week in Syria. Earlier in the week, as you say, he went to the Pentagon. He met with some North Koreans for quite a while and emerged saying he would meet again with Kim Jong Un - date and location still uncertain. All this projects the importance of the presidency, and it sends the message that the nation needs to unite behind him even if his standing at home is at its weakest point yet. SIMON: More candidates for 2020 this week. ELVING: Yes, we picked up a couple more this week. Kirsten Gillibrand, senator from New York, is seen as a serious player, even though she announced her candidacy on a late-night comedy show, which people do these days. Tulsi Gabbard, a Democratic member of the House - there are going to be a lot of these candidates. Starbucks magnate Howard Schultz was talking about maybe running as an independent. We're going to break all records, Scott. We're going to need to have brackets just like for the football playoffs. SIMON: (Laughter) Ron Elving, thanks so much. ELVING: Thank you, Scott.

A new caravan of at least several hundred Hondurans has set off toward the United States on foot or in vehicles. Some have already crossed into Guatemala. Hundreds of Honduran migrants have crossed the Guatemalan border as they travel in the direction of the United States. The group that reached Guatemala on Tuesday is the first wave of a caravan that could consist of thousands. It's the first national border crossed by the migrants on their journey that started Monday night. Some migrants told reporters they were looking for new opportunities in the U.S. Some said they were fleeing violence. But no matter their reason for seeking a new life, they have already become symbols in the ongoing battle between President Trump and congressional Democrats over border security as the government shutdown enters its 26th day.  Trump seized on news of the caravan as another reason to fund his proposed border wall. \"A big new Caravan is heading up to our Southern Border from Honduras,\" Trump tweeted Tuesday. \"Tell Nancy [Pelosi] and Chuck [Schumer] that a drone flying around will not stop them. Only a Wall will work. Only a Wall, or Steel Barrier, will keep our Country safe! Stop playing political games and end the Shutdown!\" A big new Caravan is heading up to our Southern Border from Honduras. Tell Nancy and Chuck that a drone flying around will not stop them. Only a Wall will work. Only a Wall, or Steel Barrier, will keep our Country safe! Stop playing political games and end the Shutdown! This caravan is different from the one that traveled to the U.S. in October, reporter Maria Martin tells NPR. \"This particular caravan appears to be composed of disparate migrant groups, each traveling at its own pace.\" The first group of several hundred who arrived at the Guatemalan border was held at the border checkpoint of Agua Caliente for several hours as officials checked documentation. Many were then allowed to enter Guatemala, but some unaccompanied minors were returned to Honduras or placed in the care of Guatemalan welfare agencies, Martin reports. \"One caravan member said he wasn't afraid of President Trump and his threat to build a wall,\" Martin adds. \"Many said joining the caravan was their only option, due to a lack of opportunities in Honduras.\" Honduran officials have estimated the caravan consists of between 800 and 1,000 people, The New York Times reports. Honduras' National Human Rights Commission says there could be as many as 2,000 migrants in the caravan. Some are traveling by foot, and some hitched rides to the Guatemalan border. \"We are going out of necessity, because of the poverty,\" a former police officer, Edilberto Hernandez, told the AP. After losing his job he could find only low-paid construction work, he said. He was traveling with his wife and four children. Secretary of Homeland Security Kirstjen Nielsen said the U.S. is \"closely monitoring\" the caravan. \"To be clear \u2014 participation in a caravan does not grant you a special status or provide you special treatment,\" she said. The earlier caravan became a pivotal issue in the midterm elections, as Trump used the specter of hordes of criminals crossing the border to energize his base. U.S. Customs and Border Protection officials hardened the border in November as they prepared for the first caravan's arrival, installing concertina wire and positioning barricades. U.S. agents fired tear gas at members of that group of migrants, who they said were trying to breach the border. UPDATE: Another migrant caravan headed to U.S.  Nearly 1,000 people from Honduras.  Designed to overwhelm our system & undermine U.S. law. These caravans will continue without end. Is this how U.S. immigration policy should be set - by other countries? #BorderSecurityNow If this caravan reaches the U.S., migrants wishing to seek asylum will join thousands of migrants from October's caravan who are still waiting their turn to apply, The Washington Post reports. \"I want to apply for asylum in the U.S., but I would stay in Mexico if I had to,\" 23-year-old Jimmy Senteno, traveling with his 5-year-old daughter, told the Post. Senteno said he hadn't been able to find work in Honduras, and he was afraid to leave his house because of gang violence. So he decided to take his chances with the caravan. \"I know only some in the last caravan made it, but I have to try.\"",

            "article_content": "The Democratic presidential field grew over the weekend, with two more candidates joining the race. But more than a dozen are poised on the sidelines of the 2020 primary.  MARY LOUISE KELLY, HOST: It may be 2019, but the 2020 presidential campaign has already begun. Some potential Democratic candidates have taken big steps towards running, the latest being Julian Castro. The former mayor of San Antonio and former Obama cabinet member announced this weekend he's running for president. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) JULIAN CASTRO: When my grandmother got here almost a hundred years ago, I'm sure that she never could've imagined that just two generations later, one of her grandsons would be serving as a member of the United States Congress and the other would be standing with you here today to say these words. I am a candidate for president of the United States of America. (CHEERING) KELLY: For more about how the 2020 Democratic field is filling out, we are joined by NPR's lead political editor Domenico Montanaro. Hello, Domenico. DOMENICO MONTANARO, BYLINE: Hey there, Mary Louise. KELLY: Start with Castro and that announcement we just heard. What struck you about it? MONTANARO: Well, you know, the fact is Castro is Latino. And you know, he made a lot of comments during this speech that were bilingual, frankly. He also said in Spanish, (speaking Spanish); I am a candidate for president of the United States. And that really struck a lot of Latinos in a really emotional way because to be able to see this - for any immigrant family, frankly - see somebody go - able to cross this threshold is really fundamental, especially in this era of President Trump, to be honest. KELLY: In this era of talking about the border and immigration - and he's a third-generation Mexican-American. Another well-known name who has jumped in recently - well-known name who's jumped in recently is Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren. She has been all over the map for months. She was in New Hampshire this weekend. What are we learning about the case that she's going to make to voters? MONTANARO: Well, she's a fighter, right? And she's been making a very strong case about corporations and Wall Street going unregulated and kind of working within the system. She talks about CEOs and executives getting rich while the little guy gets the scraps. And she was in New Hampshire this weekend, and she went a little bit broader than just that. So let's take a listen there. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) ELIZABETH WARREN: We need to make change in this country - not little bitty change, not change at the margins, not a nibble around the edges, not even pass one good law here and one good law there. We need to make systemic change in this country. MONTANARO: And that might sound a lot like Bernie Sanders - kind of radical, take down the system, change things from the way they are. KELLY: Bernie Sanders, who is also thinking about making a run in 2020. MONTANARO: Absolutely. And, you know - but the difference here with Bernie Sanders in this time around if he decides to run - people are wondering if his base will stay with him because you have so many more options. It's not just Bernie versus the establishment. And frankly, I think a lot of people are looking at this election as pugilism versus pragmatism. Are you somebody who's going to be a fighter and fight for those causes, or are you going to be somebody who takes incremental change? And what one strategist said to me was that they want to find somebody they can fall in love with, somebody that they can go to the mat for, especially because President Trump has such a loyal following. KELLY: Circle you back quickly to Elizabeth Warren, who the president has a habit of tweeting about. He had a pretty stunning... MONTANARO: Yeah. KELLY: ...Tweet about her over the weekend. What did it say? MONTANARO: He did. You know, he again called her Pocahontas. He went further, saying that it would've been a smash if her husband had dressed in full Indian garb and filmed it from Bighorn or Wounded Knee. And there's so much going on there that a lot of people have found racist or offensive. I mean, hundreds of people were killed. Women and children were massacred at Wounded Knee. Congress apologize for this in 1990. But the fact that he's going after her is very telling because he goes after opponents he sees as threats. KELLY: All right, a lot of jockeying in the months to come as the Democrats try to figure out who might be able to take on and beat President Trump in 2020. Domenico Montanaro, thanks very much. MONTANARO: Absolutely - be more to talk about. KELLY: Oh, yes. Copyright \u00a9 2019 NPR.  All rights reserved.

President Trump spoke to the centennial gathering of the American Farm Bureau Federation Monday, cultivating ties to rural voters who were a key factor in his 2016 election. \"I'm proud to be a great friend of the farmer,\" Trump said, addressing the group's convention for the second year in a row. The president drew applause as he recounted administration efforts to reduce regulation and save the very wealthiest farmers from the estate tax. Trump devoted much of his speech to the ongoing stalemate over the border wall, a fight that has shuttered parts of the federal government, including much of the U.S. Department of Agriculture. \"The USDA is doing everything in its power to help farmers deal with the ongoing shutdown,\" Trump said, even as crop forecasts have been delayed by the standoff and Farm Service Agency offices around the country are closed. \"The people who work in these offices, they're our neighbors,\" said Kristin Duncanson, who raises hogs, corn, and soybeans in Mapleton, Minn. \"You've got to feel bad for them not getting a paycheck.\" Trump once again insisted that Congress approve funding for his $5.7 billion border wall, to address what he called a humanitarian and security crisis on the U.S. border with Mexico. Illegal border crossings were actually lower in the last fiscal year than in 2014 and 2016, and at one point, Trump seemed to acknowledge that the situation on the border hasn't changed dramatically. \"It's been there for years. It's been there for decades,\" Trump said. Arizona rancher Jim Chilton, whose property borders Mexico, echoed the president's call for a new barrier. \"Mr. President, we need a wall,\" Chilton said, when he briefly joined Trump on stage. Other farmers are more concerned with securing sufficient labor from south of the border. \"You need people to help you with the farms,\" Trump conceded. \"I'm going to make that easier.\" He did not elaborate. While exit polls show Trump won 62 percent of the rural vote in 2016, the farm belt has not necessarily shared in the booming U.S. economy. Net farm income fell an estimated 12 percent last year. And it's down about 40 percent from its peak in 2013. \"We've got to get the farm economy booming again, not only for the farmers and ranchers but when our folks are prospering, that helps our industry sector partners,\" said Dale Moore, executive vice president of the Farm Bureau Federation. The drop in farm income is partly a result of cyclical factors including over-production and a resulting drop in commodity prices. But Trump has added to farmers' woes by picking trade fights with China, Mexico, Canada and the European Union. \"We weather the weather across the world well,\" Duncanson said. \"It's weathering the politics that makes managing our businesses a little tougher than they have in the past.\" Trump's withdrawal from an Asia-Pacific trade deal has put U.S. exporters at a disadvantage in markets such as Japan. And other countries have imposed retaliatory tariffs on a wide variety of farm produce. Trump tried to reassure his audience that his aggressive trade policies will soon pay off. \"We are fixing broken trade deals that are horrible,\" Trump said. \"Many, many new markets are being opened up.\" China, which had been a major purchaser of U.S. soybeans, all but stopped buying last year in retaliation for Trump's tariffs. There are signs of a thaw, however, as trade talks with China continue. Trump boasted that an updated version of the North American Free Trade Agreement will boost agricultural trade with Mexico and Canada, provided it wins approval from Congress. In the meantime, the administration is offering $12 billion in aid to farmers who have been hurt by the trade wars.",

            "article_content": "President Trump acts like his campaign promise to build a border wall means the difference between keeping his base of supporters and losing them. But is that really the case?  AUDIE CORNISH, HOST: Immigration has always been President Trump's signature issue, from the day he rode down the golden escalator at Trump Tower and talked about Mexican rapists to his warning about approaching caravans of migrants during the midterm campaign. Most importantly, for the president, he sees it as the issue that motivates his core support. NPR's Mara Liasson has this report. MARA LIASSON, BYLINE: Donald Trump always trusts his gut, and he believes he has a keen understanding of the political perils for him in this latest debate about immigration. In the Oval Office yesterday, he spelled them out. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: If I did something that was foolish, like gave up on border security, the first ones that would hit me are my senators. They'd be angry at me. The second Hmongs would be the House. And the third ones would be, frankly, my base... LIASSON: His base, as he often points out, is behind him all the way. And he does have very strong approval ratings among Republicans. Matt Schlapp, chairman of the American Conservative Union, says a big reason for that support is immigration. MATT SCHLAPP: The base of the party actually wants to see security first. And they want to see that southern border sealed. And so Donald Trump is the candidate, and now the president, who identifies with that very strong conviction for Republicans and for conservatives. He has a great deal of credibility on the issue of immigration with these folks. LIASSON: A great deal of credibility, but apparently not unlimited credibility. In private, several of the president's advisers state flatly that Trump can't win re-election if he doesn't build the wall or at least do everything in his power to get it done. Back in December, when the president indicated he might sign a budget bill without wall funding, he got tremendous pushback from conservative talk show hosts, who Trump's advisers believe speak for a lot of Trump supporters. It turns out his base took him literally and seriously when it came to the wall. Fox News host Laura Ingraham reacted against Trump's assertion that the wall was already being built. In her view, merely renovating current border barriers just wouldn't cut it. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) LAURA INGRAHAM: That's not a wall. Stop saying it's a wall. There's no wall. If you want a wall, say we don't have the wall and - I know it's bad because he made the promise, but they're not building the wall. LIASSON: But now, President Trump has come up with a way to keep faith with his base even if he can't convince Democrats to fund a wall. If a compromise is impossible, the president said today, he'd, quote, \"definitely\" do an end run around Congress, declare a national emergency and build the wall with unobligated Pentagon funds. And even if that gambit is stopped in court, he'll have shown his supporters he did everything he could. Pollster John McLaughlin, who worked for Trump during the 2016 campaign, says in that case, his base will be satisfied. JOHN MCLAUGHLIN: They see him fighting. And if they realize the Democrats don't give it to him, they've seen him fight the good fight. LIASSON: Polling on immigration depends a lot on how the questions are worded, but almost every poll shows that while border security is broadly popular with voters, the wall and shutting down the government to get a wall is not - except among Trump's core supporters. And now that Trump is promising to act alone if necessary, he's getting praise from some of the same conservatives that previously attacked him for waffling on the wall. Over the weekend, Rush Limbaugh told his listeners that Trump has to do this all by himself. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) RUSH LIMBAUGH: It remains a one-man show, Donald Trump against the Democrat Party and the media. We are very fortunate the guy does not cave. LIASSON: Regardless of how the shutdown and the battle over the border is resolved, this fight will not end in 2019. Today, on his way out of the White House, Trump made sure to describe the border issue as more than just a wall. The Democrats, he said, don't care about crime. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) TRUMP: I really don't think they care about crime. And, you know, sadly, they're viewing this as the beginning of the 2020 presidential race. And that's OK with me. LIASSON: It's OK with him because he sees it that way too, as he tweeted in December, quote, \"we have the issue - border security 2020 - exclamation point.\" Mara Liasson, NPR News, Washington.

Even so, it's calling attention to administration priorities about the Southern border. Updated at 1:25 p.m. ET The ongoing government shutdown didn't stop the Justice Department's public affairs office from issuing statements this week about cases involving America's Southern border. Officials in Washington, D.C., instructed field office workers on Dec. 21 that the public affairs unit would \"only issue press releases to the extent it is necessary to ensure public safety or national security, such as a terrorist attack or something of similar magnitude.\" That's why the pair of announcements this week raised some eyebrows \u2014 the cases involved the sentencing of foreign-born defendants who participated in an international sex trafficking operation, forcing young women and girls from Mexico and Central America into prostitution. Even though the government is shut down, those announcements appeared ahead of a speech scheduled for Tuesday night in which President Trump is expected to make a case that there's an \"emergency\" on the border and a later trip to the border to see it himself. \"As this is the only public release that DOJ has put out during the government shutdown, it is of high national importance,\" a Justice Department spokesperson said in a written statement Monday. Authorities also highlighted the cases in an official Twitter stream. Five Members of Mexican Sex Trafficking Organization Sentenced to Prison  https://t.co/TCKg20Wb5R Longtime law enforcement observers wondered to NPR how those cases fit into the public safety or national security exception, especially because the defendants had been held in federal custody for years before their sentencing. But the DOJ emphasis on trafficking does fit with recent rhetoric from Trump, who has been citing the threat of sex trafficking as one of the reasons he wants to build a wall along the Southern border. Trump has said, without evidence, that such a wall would have a \"huge effect\" on trafficking. The administration wants Democrats to agree to authorize some $5 billion for a border wall and end the impasse over funding the government that has idled much of the Justice Department and other agencies. Democrats won't go along. They argue the United States can enhance its border security without a physical barrier and also want to deny Trump the ability to fulfill a signature campaign promise \u2014 although Trump had also said that Mexico would pay for a wall. Former prosecutors pointed out to NPR that the public fight over the wall has largely pushed developments in the ongoing investigation of Russian election interference out of the news. The special counsel, Robert Mueller, and his team are covered by a separate funding stream and are at work despite the partial federal government shutdown. Justice Department spokeswoman Kerri Kupec said that the decision about whether to issue press releases publicizing cases is a \"discretionary\" one and that despite the furlough, her small team is continuing to operate in a \"limited manner.\" \"We've tried in our limited capacity to answer requests as we're able and are issuing occasional news releases,\" Kupec told NPR. Across the country, U.S. attorneys have issued more than a half-dozen news releases since the shutdown about cases of interest, including the indictment of Russian lawyer Natalia Veselnitskaya for alleged obstruction of justice.",

Venezuelan Justice Christian Zerpa left the country for the U.S., denouncing the re-election of President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro. A Venezuelan Supreme Court judge who once supported President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro has fled to the United States and publicly denounced Maduro's re-election days before the inauguration. Justice Christian Zerpa left Venezuela with his wife and two daughters, according to Miami broadcaster EVTV. Their destination in the U.S. was unclear. Zerpa met a reporter in Orlando and told the outlet, \"I think the president,  Nicol\u00e1s Maduro, does not deserve a second chance because the election he supposedly won was not a free election, was not a competitive election.\" Maduro won the May 2018 race amid widespread accusations of fraud. He will begin his second term on Thursday. Zerpa said he did not speak out against the election results months ago out of concerns for his family's safety. Maduro's Socialist Party \"gradually but steadily\" co-opted the Supreme Court and \"turned it into an appendage of the executive branch,\" according to the International Commission of Jurists. In 2016, following a landslide electoral victory by the opposition, Zerpa helped Maduro consolidate power through a court decision that diminished the powers of Congress, according to Reuters. \"They chose me [for the court] because I was one of the loyal, disciplined members in the United Socialist Party of Venezuela,\" Zerpa told EVTV.

Venezuela's Supreme Court of Justice responded to Zerpa's decision to leave by noting he was being investigated for sexual harassment, lewd acts and psychological violence. Zerpa \"fled the country, exercising his constitutional right, to avoid justice and so his crimes remain unpunished,\" said Supreme Court President Maikel Moreno, who said the investigation began last November. According to a Reuters investigation, Moreno himself was arrested in connection with the homicide of a teenager in 1989 and was defrocked as an appeals court judge in 2007 for improperly releasing two murder suspects. \"Under Moreno as chief justice, the court proceeded to dismiss every legal challenge to Maduro's authority that has reached the bench,\" the report stated. Zerpa is not the first Venezuelan justice to flee to the United States. Former Supreme Court Judge Eladio Aponte Aponte fled in 2012 after accusing the government of corruption. Maduro, then the foreign minister, called him a fugitive who \"sold his soul.\" Under Maduro, who succeeded President Hugo Ch\u00e1vez in 2013, the once thriving country has seen hyperinflation, shortages of food and medicine, and waves of fleeing citizens rushing the border out of desperation. Caracas has faced angry protests, U.S. sanctions and a slump in oil exports. The government has also cracked down on dissent through the \"arbitrary arrests and detentions\" of thousands of people, according to human rights groups. Many detainees say they were tortured and sexually abused. The new president of Venezuela's opposition-controlled National Assembly, Juan Guaido, was sworn in last week. U.S. State Department spokesperson Robert Palladino called the body \"the only legitimate and last remaining democratically elected institution that truly represents the will of the Venezuelan people.\"",

Trump stood firm on his demand for billions of dollars to fund a border wall with Mexico, which has forced a shutdown of the government now entering its third week. Updated at 10:15 p.m. ET The White House is planning a media blitz as President Trump pushes for a wall along the Southern border, which congressional Democrats have repeatedly rebuffed. This week's events involving the president come as a partial shutdown of the federal government drags into its third week with no apparent end in sight to the impasse. Trump tweeted he will \"Address the Nation on the Humanitarian and National Security crisis on our Southern Border\" on Tuesday night. It will be his first Oval Office address as president. The president is asking the television networks for 7-8 minutes of airtime, White House deputy chief of staff Bill Shine told NPR. After CNN and other outlets reported that all the major broadcast and cable networks will carry the Trump Oval Office address, the two leading Democrats on Capitol Hill demanded airtime to respond. \"Now that the television networks have decided to air the President's address, which if his past statements are any indication will be full of malice and misinformation, Democrats must immediately be given equal airtime,\" House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., said in a joint statement. I am pleased to inform you that I will Address the Nation on the Humanitarian and National Security crisis on our Southern Border. Tuesday night at 9:00 P.M. Eastern. White House press secretary Sarah Sanders also announced Monday that Trump will travel to the border on Thursday \"to meet with those on the frontlines of the national security and humanitarian crisis.\" A wall on the Southern border with Mexico was Trump's hallmark campaign promise, and he is under pressure from his base and conservative commentators to deliver. But unable to obtain the funding he desired for it under a GOP-controlled Congress for the past two years, Trump last month said he would not sign any spending measure that did not contain sufficient funding for its construction. As a result of the standoff, about a quarter of the government shut down on Dec. 22. In 2019, the president is now hitting even more resistance from the newly installed Democratic House after a bruising midterm election cycle where Democrats won 40 House seats. It's an argument Trump and his allies have struggled to make since before they took office, but now they will try to use his bully pulpit to move public opinion. An NPR/PBS NewsHour/Marist Poll last month found that Americans \u2014 by a 21-point margin, 57 percent to 36 percent \u2014 wanted Trump to compromise on the wall instead of shutting down the government. Over two-thirds also said a wall shouldn't be an immediate priority for Congress. Weekend talks between Vice President Pence and congressional staffers to resolve the shutdown stalemate produced no breakthrough. Although Trump characterized the talks as \"productive,\" Democrats said there was no progress. Pence told reporters at the White House on Monday that Trump was \"considering\" declaring a national emergency \u2014 the option is being \"looked at and examined\" \u2014 which could allow him to begin construction of the wall. Over the weekend, the White House did formalize its request for $5.7 billion to fund the border wall \u2014 a number Pence said Monday Trump will not retreat from. In a letter to lawmakers, the administration said that sum would pay for 234 miles of new barrier, at a cost of roughly $24 million per mile. The material used would now be steel, not concrete. The administration is also seeking hundreds of millions of dollars for additional Border Patrol agents, immigration judges, detention beds, drug detection equipment and to address what it calls \"urgent humanitarian needs.\" Pence argued that this approach represented a compromise on the White House's part, to go beyond just a wall and fund things Democrats want too. And he pushed back on criticism that this was just a way to appeal to Trump's \"base.\" \"This isn't about [the] base. This is about the American people. This is about human trafficking; this is about a humanitarian crisis; this is about the flow of illegal drugs, illegal immigrants and the president's determination to address that issue with action and with resources,\" Pence said. Congressional Democrats are resisting the president's demand for wall funding. Trump \"is still demanding that American taxpayers pay at least $5.7 billion for his wall, which can't pass either chamber of Congress and of course Mexico is not paying for,\" Pelosi and Schumer also said in their statement Monday night. In an exercise in political messaging, the House is expected to begin voting Tuesday on a series of bills to reopen shuttered government agencies without additional money for a border barrier. Although a handful of Republican senators from swing states have expressed a desire to end the partial shutdown, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., is adamant that the Senate will not vote on funding bills that don't have support from the president. Meanwhile, Senate Democrats say they will block even bringing up the start of legislative business this week. According to a senior Democratic aide, Schumer has notified the caucus he will vote against proceeding to the first bill of the session because Senate Republicans should instead be bringing up the Democratic-led House-passed bills to reopen the government. Friday is a scheduled payday for federal workers. If the impasse is not resolved by then, some 800,000 federal employees will miss being paid for the first time during the shutdown. If the standoff continues into the weekend, it will be the longest shutdown in recent history. It also has the potential to impact February food stamp benefits provided by the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program. Tax refund checks might have been disrupted too, but the White House said Monday the IRS will issue refunds during the shutdown.

            "article_content": "The 116th Congress officially convened on Thursday with Democrats taking control of the House of Representatives for the first time in eight years. And with Democrats' newfound power and Republicans' first time in the minority in nearly a decade, both parties saw a shuffle in their leadership teams. The Democratic leadership is a diverse slate, representing the record number of women and minorities their new caucus brings to Capitol Hill \u2014 Nancy Pelosi is resuming her place as the first female House speaker in history, with four other top positions either being filled by a woman or person of color. Republicans, however, have a leadership slate made up almost entirely of white males. Here's who you need to know in House leadership for both parties in the new Congress: House Democratic Leadership Top row: House Majority Whip James Clyburn of South Carolina (left), Speaker Nancy Pelosi of California, Democratic Caucus Chairman Hakeem Jeffries of New York. Bottom row: Assistant House Speaker Ben Ray Lujan of New Mexico (left), Majority Leader Steny Hoyer of Maryland and Congressional Campaign Committee Chairwoman Cheri Bustos of Illinois.\n                \n                    \n                    Saul Loeb/AFP; Mandel Ngan/AFP (2); Drew Angerer; Zach Gibson/AFP; Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption House Democratic Leadership Top row: House Majority Whip James Clyburn of South Carolina (left), Speaker Nancy Pelosi of California, Democratic Caucus Chairman Hakeem Jeffries of New York. Bottom row: Assistant House Speaker Ben Ray Lujan of New Mexico (left), Majority Leader Steny Hoyer of Maryland and Congressional Campaign Committee Chairwoman Cheri Bustos of Illinois. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif. Pelosi made history as the first woman speaker ever when she took the gavel in 2007. Now, she retakes it again 12 years later, also making her the first speaker to reclaim the position in more than six decades. The San Francisco lawmaker has had her detractors, and many incoming freshmen in swing district campaigned on new leadership. On Thursday, fifteen in her caucus either voted for someone else or simply voted present. Still, those defections were much fewer than the 78-year-old feared last fall, showcasing her deal-making prowess that even many Republicans privately praise her for. She'll have to manage a caucus with diverging opinions and a vocal progressive wing, and have to grapple with a Republican Senate \u2014 something she didn't have to contend with during her first tenure. And, of course, plenty of clashes with President Trump also likely await. First on the agenda: trying to find an end to the partial government shutdown, with Pelosi pledging not to budge on funding for the wall on the southern border with Mexico that Trump says is a requirement before he will sign spending measures that would end the shutdown. House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer, D-Md. The 79-year-old Hoyer also resumed the same post he had during Democrats' last turn in the majority, moving up from serving as minority whip for the past eight years. Pelosi and Hoyer have a had a long, sometimes testy, relationship. She hails from the legendary Maryland D'Alesandro political family, but that hasn't always endeared the two to each other, though they've denied any friction in recent years. Pelosi first beat Hoyer for whip in 2001 and she backed a challenger to Hoyer for majority leader when Democrats last took control in 2006. As The New York Times, recently wrote, the \"Pelosi-Hoyer frenemies dynamic, long a subject of intrigue in the Capitol, is growing ever more complex\" as they're back in power together. But Hoyer has been a political survivor. He's the longest-serving current Democrat in the House, first elected in 1981. Hoyer is also the only white male in the top ranks of Democratic leadership. House Majority Whip Jim Clyburn, D-S.C. The 78-year-old Clyburn is the highest-ranking African-American lawmaker in Congress. He served as whip when Democrats had the majority from 2007 until 2011, and then served as assistant House Democratic leader while Democrats were in the minority \u2014 a post Pelosi created especially for him when Hoyer and Clyburn were competing against each other after the 2010 elections. When Democrats were last in the majority, Clyburn served as chairman of the House Democratic Caucus. It wasn't lost on many Democrats this year, though, that the trio at the top of the leadership ranks are all in their late seventies. And there's a proposal Pelsoi has backed to change that, term-limiting the top three spots to bring change over the next few years. Assistant Speaker, Ben Ray Lujan, D-N.M. Lujan was awarded this No. 4 post after leading the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee for the past two cycles, resulting in a 40-seat gain in November and Democrats flipping control of the chamber. The position makes the 46-year-old the highest-ranking Latino in Congress, and part of a new generation of potential Democratic leaders once the top three leaders eventually step aside. Democratic Caucus Chairman Hakeem Jeffries, D-N.Y. Jeffries narrowly defeated California Rep. Barbara Lee in caucus elections in November to claim the No. 5 leadership post. Some of Lee's allies claimed sexism and ageism in the vote, and criticized Jeffries as too centrist. Still, the victory set up the 48-year-old New York lawmaker, once called \"Brooklyn's Barack Obama,\" as a possible speaker of the House one day, which would make him the first black Speaker in history if that happens. And his addition means there's another African-American in Democratic leadership. Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee Chairwoman Cheri Bustos, D-Ill. Bustos has the tough task of protecting Democrats' newfound majority, but she brings credentials to the table unlike the others atop leadership \u2014 she represents a somewhat rural Illinois district that Trump narrowly carried, not unlike many of the seats Democrats will have to defend in 2020. A political protege of Senate Minority Whip Dick Durbin, D-Ill., the centrist lawmaker even got four votes for speaker from incoming moderate Democratic freshmen. House Republican Leadership Top row: House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy of California (left) and National Republican Congressional Committee Chairman Tom Emmer of Minnesota.

Bottom row: Republican Conference Chairwoman Liz Cheney of Wyoming (left) and House Minority Whip Steve Scalise of Louisiana. House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif. The 53-year-old California lawmaker would have far preferred the title of \"Speaker\" following Paul Ryan's retirement, but now he will have to learn how to maneuver being in the minority for the first time in eight years. McCarthy defeated House Freedom Caucus co-founder Jim Jordan of Ohio to win the top GOP post, and he should still expect to try to contend with a vocal conservative minority within the caucus \u2014 issues that plagued both of his predecessors. He's endeared himself to Trump (reportedly even keeping his favorite Starburst flavors on hand), and McCarthy's relationship with the president will be worth watching as Trump tries to win re-election and Republicans try to win back control of the House. House Minority Whip Steve Scalise, R-La. Scalise keeps the same role he's held since 2014, albeit this time for the minority party. The 53-year-old Louisiana lawmaker survived a near-fatal shooting attempt in June 2017 after a man opened fire during a congressional baseball game practice, and had continued rehabilitation. \"I had miracles. I had angels,\" he would later tell Politico about the assassination attempt. Scalise unanimously won the whip spot again when Republicans held leadership elections in November. Republican Conference Chairwoman Liz Cheney, R-Wyo. The 52-year-old Wyoming lawmaker assumes the No. 3 House GOP leadership post more than three decades after it was once held by her father, former Vice President Dick Cheney. She's the highest-ranking woman in GOP leadership, and assumed the position after Washington Rep. Cathy McMorris Rodgers decided not to seek another term in the party's leadership ranks. The political scion was first elected in 2016 and didn't make much noise during her first term, but now she could become one of the GOP's most visible faces, especially as Republicans try to counter a large number of new freshmen women Democrats. National Republican Congressional Committee Chairman Tom Emmer, R-Minn. Emmer has to try to find a way to win back the 18 seats Republicans need to regain control of the House in 2020. He takes the position after serving as a deputy NRCC chair during the 2018 cycle. There could be divergent views within the caucus on how to do that, though. He's already gotten in a flap with New York Rep. Elise Stefanik, who said she'd help more GOP women win in primaries next year. After Emmer said it would be a \"mistake\" for Stefanik to try to intervene in primaries, she hit back, saying \"I wasn't asking for permission.\" Also on the GOP leadership team are Republican Conference Secretary Jason Smith, R-Mo., and Republican Policy Committee Chairman Gary Palmer, R-Ala.",

He does not want them to know what he's doing to clean air and clean water and the rest in his department of interior and of EPA. He does not want them to know how he is hurting them. So he keeps the subject on the wall. He's a master of diversion. INSKEEP: Pelosi spoke as new lawmakers from both parties settled into the Capitol. Combat veterans, many women, people of color and others posed for photos - quite dramatic scenes. Late in the day, President Trump emerged from the White House. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: I have never had so much support as I have in the last week over my stance for border security, for border control and for, frankly, the wall or the barrier. INSKEEP: Surveys have shown the demand for a border wall to be unpopular, though it is favored by many of his core supporters. MARTIN: All right, so we are joined now by NPR's lead political editor, Domenico Montanaro, to get the latest on the shutdown, when it's going to end. He's got all the answers, right, Domenico? DOMENICO MONTANARO, BYLINE: All of them, always. MARTIN: All of them, all the answers. OK... MONTANARO: How's it going, Rachel? MARTIN: It goes well. So Nancy Pelosi, one of the first items of business, passing this package of bills to keep the government open, no border wall funding. Is this going to go anywhere? MONTANARO: Not really because Republicans aren't going to take it up in the Senate. And the president said that he would veto it if it passed Congress. So we're back where we've been. Nancy Pelosi says that what passed was, quote, \"a mature way out\" for the president because she's not giving in on the border wall. As we heard her say, she might take a dollar but that's about all. And this measure would open the government back up, funding several agencies for a year. It would kick the fight over border funding another month, tied to funding for the Department of Homeland Security. Democrats point out this was basically what Republicans were set to pass before the president reversed course in December. MARTIN: Well, Republicans up until this point, led by Mitch McConnell, have been fairly unified on this, saying, we don't want to take up anything the president's not going to sign. But there appear to be some cracks in that front right now. MONTANARO: There are a couple cracks. At least two Republican senators are calling for funding the government without this border wall fight. That's Cory Gardner of Colorado and Susan Collins of Maine. Gardner said that Congress needs to take further action on border security, but that work should be done when the government is fully open. Collins said that the government basically should not be held hostage to this debate over border security. Oh, and by the way, Rachel, both of them are up for re-election in 2020. MARTIN: Right. MONTANARO: And we've seen Republican Senate Leader Mitch McConnell want to protect a lot of his members who are up for re-election. But so far, he's stayed on the sidelines. And a lot of people think he might be one way out of this because he would be needed to kind of move the impasse forward. MARTIN: So President Trump came out yesterday. It was supposed to be the first press briefing, with Sarah Sanders, of the new year - instead a surprise visit by the president. What did he say? MONTANARO: Yeah, it was not a press briefing. Instead, we had the president come out - seemed to be a direct response to Pelosi returning to the speakership, congratulated her but dug his heels in and tried to make the case again for the border wall funding. MARTIN: All right, NPR's Domenico Montanaro. Domenico, thank you. We appreciate it. MONTANARO: You're welcome. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) MARTIN: At one point, the president said if Congress doesn't give him the money that he wants to build a border wall, more than $5 billion, he'll just have the U.S. military do it. The president appears to be moving ahead with that idea. INSKEEP: Yeah, the Pentagon is sending more U.S. troops to the border. Their job is to build or upgrade 160 miles of fencing. It's along the border in Arizona and California. Now, bear in mind, those two states are already mostly fenced. Acting Defense Secretary Patrick Shanahan described the deployment. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) PATRICK SHANAHAN: The Army Corps of Engineers is dialed in on doing this cost effectively, quickly and with the right amount of urgency as to where we can build additional stand-up walls quickly and then get after the threat. The threat is real. INSKEEP: Troops will also provide medical care to migrant families. MARTIN: NPR's Pentagon correspondent, Tom Bowman, joins us this morning. Good morning, my friend. TOM BOWMAN, BYLINE: Hello, Rachel. MARTIN: So how many troops are we talking about here? BOWMAN: You know, at this point we don't know. And here's a challenge for the administration. There are about 2,300 active-duty troops along the border together with about 2,000 National Guard troops. Now, the deployment for the active troops wraps up at the end of the month. So they're going to have to make some decisions. Do we extend the current troops? Do we send more troops? And I'm told that for the fencing portion of this, you're looking at more combat engineers. They could possibly be sent. And also Homeland Security's (inaudible) more medical units as well. Of course, two children died along the border in the custody of U.S. officials, so they need additional help - and also aviation units to provide surveillance along the border. So they're going to have to make some decisions pretty quickly because again, the deployment wraps up at the end of the month. MARTIN: Right. And this - this is in addition to the U.S. troops who were already sent down there to manage the so-called caravan of migrants, right? BOWMAN: That's right. MARTIN: So it's also happening, obviously, during a partial government shutdown. So where are they going to get the money for this? Is this coming out of the Pentagon's previous budget? BOWMAN: They're getting it from the Pentagon budget. And also, the Pentagon has not shut down. They're still - they're still working, as we see, along the border. So yeah, there's some grumbling about this at the Pentagon. It's a waste of money, or this is not what you use active-duty troops for. This is generally a National Guard mission. So privately, there is some grumbling about this. But they say, listen, this is a legal order from the president. We'll carry it out. MARTIN: You mention decisions are going to have to be made soon. Do we have any idea, at this point, when - when we could see troops there on the border actually reinforcing fencing? BOWMAN: Well, I don't have a sense of exactly when they're going to start this mission. But I'm told it could take several months. And this is, you know - talking about a lot of mileage here. So this could, you know, require a substantial amount of troops. One official told me a few thousand troops perhaps. Another said, well, the current troops there could at least start this effort as you bring more troops in. But at this point, I know the Pentagon is working on this, planning this. And we don't have any specifics on it right yet. MARTIN: All right, NPR Pentagon correspondent Tom Bowman for us this morning. Tom, thanks. We appreciate it. BOWMAN: OK, you're welcome. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) MARTIN: All right, next we're going to turn to Israel, where thousands of new homes for Israeli settlers are being planned in the occupied West Bank. INSKEEP: Most countries denounce Israeli settlements because they're spread out across land that Palestinians demand for their own state. The Trump administration has been tolerant, though, of Israeli settlements. In fact, a watchdog group says there's been a building frenzy in the settlements since President Trump took office. MARTIN: NPR's Daniel Estrin has been visiting those areas in the West Bank. And he is on the line now. Good morning, Daniel. DANIEL ESTRIN, BYLINE: Good morning. MARTIN: What can you tell us about - about these construction plans? ESTRIN: Well, last week Israel advanced plans to build nearly 2,800 new settlement homes in the West Bank. And the big picture here, Rachel, is that in the last two years, during Trump's presidency, Israel has pushed forward a lot of settlement construction plans. And it's a big difference from the last two years of the Obama presidency. This anti-settlement watchdog group you referenced, Peace Now, tracks these numbers. And it says that in Trump's first year of office, the number of housing plans that Israel advanced was about 2 1/2 times higher than the number in the last year of the Obama administration. MARTIN: So, I mean, it's hard to overstate just how sensitive this issue is, right? ESTRIN: Yeah. MARTIN: I mean, so much of it plays into the history of the region, the identity of the peoples. Can you just explain kind of contextually how important this is for Israelis and Palestines - Palestinians, rather? ESTRIN: Settlements are at the heart of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. They are spread out in the West Bank. That's where Palestinians live, and that's where Palestinians want an independent state. And most countries want to see Israel give up at least most of the West Bank for Palestinians to have their own state. And they say that's the only way that there will be a solution to this long-running conflict. And the more Israel builds up its settlements, the more entrenched Israel becomes in that land. MARTIN: So as we noted, you've been out visiting some of these very areas where Israel has - has made these plans, advanced the settlement construction. What have you seen there? ESTRIN: Well, this morning I visited a small village, a Palestinian village called Nahalin. And across the valley is one of the biggest Israeli settlements. And it's growing. You can see the construction vehicles. You can hear the bang, bang, bang of the construction vehicles. They're building a new neighborhood to expand the settlement. And I was surprised they were even working on a Friday, which is a weekend day here. And it's one of three settlements that surround this village where Israel has recently announced new planned housing. So the Palestinian mayor of the village said he feels he's being choked. He says this is unjust. And then I drove to the settlement next door. And I met a devout Jewish Israeli there. And he said, well, this construction is good. God promised us this land in the Torah. This is our land. This is not their land. Palestinians don't deserve this land. Arabs have plenty of countries. This - there's only one Jewish state. INSKEEP: Daniel, I want to note that you said that Israeli settlement construction plans advanced during the Obama administration and the Trump administration - just a little bit slower in the Obama administration. Is the point of view of the Israeli government becoming essentially what that settler told you, that no matter what any U.S. administration says, they're going to go ahead as much as they can? ESTRIN: Well, I think a lot of - especially in the - in the settler community here, they believe that Trump is giving them a green light, whereas Obama gave them a yellow light. I remember being at a Trump election victory party in 2016. Settler activists were drinking Trump-branded vodka. They were hoping Trump would allow this to happen. And it seems - the numbers suggest that it is. MARTIN: All right, NPR's Daniel Estrin for us this morning on these new plans. Israel is planning to construct new Israeli settlements on the West Bank. Daniel, thanks. We appreciate you sharing your reporting with us. ESTRIN: You're welcome. Copyright \u00a9 2019 NPR.  All rights reserved.

Journalist Humberto Sanchez explains the priorities of his state's Hispanics.  LULU GARCIA-NAVARRO, HOST: Starting in February, Iowa and New Hampshire will be the first states to hold primaries or caucuses to choose the Democratic nominee for president. But after that comes Nevada, the first Western state to vote. What happens in Nevada could serve as a litmus test for the Latino vote. The swing state is 29% Latino. Getting the temperature of the Latino vote matters because for the first time, Latinos will be the largest non-white group to vote in a presidential election. In Nevada, candidates and their campaign staff have spent months seeking endorsements from Latino community leaders. (SOUNDBITE OF MONTAGE) UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #1: (Speaking Spanish). UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #2: (Speaking Spanish). UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #3: Joe Biden. UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #4: (Speaking Spanish). ELIZABETH WARREN: When I become president, Latinx families will have a champion in the White House. UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #5: (Speaking Spanish). GARCIA-NAVARRO: But is it working? We reached out to journalist Humberto Sanchez. He writes for the online news website The Nevada Independent. Welcome. HUMBERTO SANCHEZ: Thank you. GARCIA-NAVARRO: Can you tell me a little bit more about the demographic there? I mean, obviously, Latinos are very diverse. I mean, what does the Latino electorate look like there? SANCHEZ: They're very young. They're working-class. They are active in their unions. It's a growing population that's starting to feel its power within the electorate. GARCIA-NAVARRO: What are the issues that they care about? SANCHEZ: Latinos care about health care. They care about education because they're a young group. But they, most importantly, care about immigration. It's a tight-knit community, so everybody knows someone who's been caught up in the system. So it hits home the issue, and so people are very engaged for that reason. GARCIA-NAVARRO: Can you tell me a story about a Latino voter there that might, you know, exemplify some of the things that they're thinking about right now? SANCHEZ: Well, it's interesting. Somebody whose endorsement is highly sought is someone who cannot vote - who's Astrid Silva. She's a very important voice in Nevada. She's a DREAMer. She gave the retort to the State of the Union in 2017. Her endorsement has been sought, but ironically, she cannot vote. GARCIA-NAVARRO: What have Democratic candidates been doing? I mean, we have, obviously, the culinary union. It's very strong there. It really made a big difference in 2018. What are we seeing on the ground in Nevada? SANCHEZ: The candidates are flooding to Nevada every weekend, every day there's an event. They're speaking to the unions. They're speaking to the casinos. They're going and trying to reach people wherever they can. Elizabeth Warren has had people in Nevada since January. It's been a very impressive flood of staff. GARCIA-NAVARRO: Nevada hasn't been getting a lot of national media attention in the same way as South Carolina or Iowa, but it is much more representative of the diversity of the country. And with the Democratic race still so wide open, how important is Nevada right now? SANCHEZ: Nevada's really important. It's pretty much the gateway to the West for the Democratic nominee. That's because doing well in Nevada could set yourself up for doing well in California, which has 495 delegates up for grabs, which could be all she wrote after that. GARCIA-NAVARRO: Joe Biden currently leads in Latino polling, with Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren right behind. Why? SANCHEZ: Joe Biden is seen as somebody who can beat Donald Trump, and that is something that's really important to Nevadans and the Latino community. Recently, Representative Dina Titus - she endorsed Joe Biden, and she made that very point that he is the candidate that can beat Donald Trump. And her district is very diverse and is where most of the Democrats live in the state. GARCIA-NAVARRO: So we saw a big change, though, in Nevada with more Latinos coming out to vote in 2018, and that felt like there was a real sea change. I mean, is there an expectation now that Latinos in Nevada have reached their sort of electoral potential and that they're an engaged part of the electorate? SANCHEZ: Well, it's a young community, and it's growing more and more - are eligible to vote every year. So the trend has been that they are starting to flex their muscles more. So if that continues, then they'll be growing power within the state for years to come. GARCIA-NAVARRO: That was Humberto Sanchez of The Nevada Independent. Thank you very much. SANCHEZ: Thanks for having me. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) Copyright \u00a9 2019 NPR.  All rights reserved.  Visit our website terms of use and permissions pages at www.npr.org for further information.

The U.S. Supreme Court's conservative majority signaled Tuesday that it may let the Trump administration shut down the Obama-era program that granted temporary protection from deportation to roughly 700,000 young people, commonly known as DREAMers. Brought to the U.S. illegally as children, the DREAMers were allowed to legally work and go to school if they met certain requirements and passed a background check. The program, begun in 2012, is known as DACA \u2014 Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals. The Supreme Court heard arguments Tuesday on the DACA program.\n                \n                    \n                    Susan Walsh/AP\n                    \n                \nhide caption The Supreme Court heard arguments Tuesday on the DACA program. Until Tuesday the administration had consistently maintained that it had no choice but to pull the plug on the program because, as President Trump's attorney general put it in September 2017, the DACA program was \"illegal\" and \"unconstitutional\" from the time it was first put in place in 2012. Three federal appeals courts disagreed and ruled that when an administration revokes a policy like this, on which so many people, businesses and even the U.S. economy have relied, the administration must provide a fully supported rationale that weighs the pros and cons of the program, the costs and the benefits. Faced with those lower court decisions, the Trump administration appealed to the Supreme Court, which seemed Tuesday to be on the verge of a contrary decision. Hundreds of people gather outside the U.S. Supreme Court to rally in support of DACA.\n                \n                    \n                    Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption Hundreds of people gather outside the U.S. Supreme Court to rally in support of DACA. Can the Supreme Court even decide this case? Solicitor General Noel Francisco opened the argument, telling the justices that they have no authority to review the policy change because DACA is a discretionary program under which the Obama administration used its prosecutorial discretion to defer deportations for certain qualified individuals. The court's liberals pushed back. \"There's a strange element to your argument,\" Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg told the solicitor general. She pointed out that he was arguing that \"this is a discretionary matter\" and therefore \"not reviewable because it's committed to agency discretion. But on the other hand, you say the agency had no discretion because this program was illegal.... So how can it be committed to your discretion when you're saying 'we have no discretion'?\" Ginsburg said that even a second memo, written after the litigation began, was \"infected\" with the idea that DACA was illegal. Justice Sonia Sotomayor pointed to Trump's conflicting remarks about DACA recipients, noting that the president told the DREAMers that they were \"safe under him\" and then abruptly ended the program. \"We own this\" But when the lawyers representing the DACA plaintiffs rose to argue, they got a fusillade of doubt from the conservative wing of the court. Chief Justice John Roberts sought to minimize the number of immigrants covered by previous programs similar to DACA, dating to the 1950s. Other members of the conservative majority fired different rounds. The case tests the legality of DACA, a federal immigration policy that has given protection from deportation to 700,000 people brought illegally to the U.S. when they were children.\n                \n                    \n                    Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption Justice Samuel Alito posed this hypothetical: Let's say an administration decides not to prosecute drug cases involving less than 5 kilos of cocaine, and the next administration decides to change the amount to 3 kilos. Would that be reviewable by the courts? Lawyer Theodore Olson, who represented the plaintiffs, replied that DACA is different because of the huge number of people and industries and businesses that have relied on the assurances in the existing program. If the government wants to change such a program, he said, it has to lay out its policy reasons, and not just by fiat say that the DACA policy was illegal from the get-go. \"What more would you have the government say?\" interjected Justice Neil Gorsuch. \"What good would another five years of litigation over the adequacy of the explanation serve?\" Replied Olson: \"We don't know what the administration would do.\" The Trump administration \"did not want to own this decision.\" It was not an independent decision reached by the acting secretary of homeland security because DHS was bound by the attorney general's one-sentence decision saying DACA was illegal, Olson said. In rebuttal, Francisco, the Trump administration lawyer, batted that down, saying the administration has decided that even if DACA was and is legal, Trump has decided to shut it down. \"We own this,\" he said.",

            "article_content": "The Supreme Court hears arguments in a case involving DACA recipients. New transcripts from key officials involved in Ukraine policy are released. And, Turkey begins repatriating ISIS fighters.  NOEL KING, HOST: What is the future for hundreds of thousands of young immigrants who were brought to this country illegally by their parents? STEVE INSKEEP, HOST: That is the question for the Supreme Court today. The case focuses on the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program known as DACA. President Obama first approved this plan. It offers temporary protections to people who are often called DREAMers. President Trump tried to revoke the program, only to have the lower courts temporarily block his action in a case that the highest court now decides. KING: NPR's John Burnett covers immigration, and he's been watching this case closely. Good morning, John. JOHN BURNETT, BYLINE: Morning, Noel. KING: So give us a little history of DACA, if you would. Remind us what it is exactly. BURNETT: Sure. It was enacted by Obama in the summer of 2012, and it's called Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals. And it does just that. It protects these people from deportation, and it lets them work and go to school. To qualify, immigrants had to have arrived before they were 16, be a high school graduate or a veteran and have committed no serious crimes. It applies to more than 700,000 young people. Some have started families. They have jobs. They're nurses and teachers. And many don't remember their birth countries. They consider themselves thoroughly American. KING: What happened that DACA ended up now in front of the Supreme Court? BURNETT: So the Trump administration says that Obama never had the executive authority to create DACA in the first place, it's illegal. And immigration hard-liners believe the program is really nothing more than a dressed-up amnesty for people who came to the country unlawfully. And so Trump's Homeland Security secretary rescinded it in 2017. But the DREAMers have lots of defenders, and immigration attorneys pounced. They sued the administration, saying Trump didn't cancel the program the right way. And three separate federal judges have agreed with them. One said the kill-off of DACA was arbitrary and capricious. The government appealed. And today it's before the high court, where Trump believes conservative justices will see things his way. KING: So what do we know about what each side is going to argue in front of the court? BURNETT: Right. Well, the attorney for the DREAMers will say that the government broke administrative rules when it pulled the plug on DACA and it should be reinstated. The government attorney will defend the program's cancellation as lawful and justified. And meanwhile, the future of hundreds of thousands of young people in the U.S. hangs in the balance. One of them is Michele Segura (ph). She's a 25-year-old grad student in business administration, and she works as a college counselor in Los Angeles. MICHELE SEGURA: You know, there's nine people in the Supreme Court who are deciding the fate of 700,000 people, myself included. I've been living, since 2017 - since the Trump administration rescinded DACA, I've fallen into depression. And everything is just on the line. BURNETT: And she told me that she's been camping out in the line that's formed outside the Supreme Court in the cold to get a seat in the public gallery to watch these historic oral arguments today. KING: Temperatures were, like, in the 20s last night. God, I shiver just to think of it. So John, the Supreme Court will issue an opinion next year. If it doesn't rule in favor of the DACA recipients, of the DREAMers, what happens to them? BURNETT: Well, the Supreme Court could tell the administration - if you want to end DACA, you have to go about it a different way. But it gets into politics because the program is very popular. Amicus briefs in support of DACA have come in from business groups and universities and law enforcement, religious leaders. And polls show big majorities of Democrats and Republicans sympathetic to these young people, who are mostly from Latin America. An analyst told me what ultimately has to happen if DACA is to be reserved, Congress needs to enact the law. KING: OK. NPR's John Burnett. John, thanks so much. BURNETT: Happy to be here. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) KING: The impeachment inquiry will go public tomorrow. INSKEEP: Of course there have been private interviews before impeachment investigators up to now. And some new testimony from that process is emerging. These are witnesses who appeared before the House Intelligence committee and other committees. Transcripts of their testimony appear to support the case that the Trump administration tied military aid for Ukraine to investigations of President Trump's political rivals. KING: NPR congressional reporter Claudia Grisales has been working her way through the newest documents. Good morning, Claudia. CLAUDIA GRISALES, BYLINE: Good morning, Noel. KING: OK. So more pages of testimony from behind closed doors. Let's talk about who this time, and let's talk about what you found. GRISALES: Well, yes, the committee's released three additional transcripts for closed-door testimony for two State Department diplomats and a Pentagon official. Catherine Croft and Christopher Anderson both work at the State Department. And they corroborated the testimony from their colleagues on several fronts, including that military aid to Ukraine was held up and that Trump's personal attorney, Rudy Giuliani, was running shadow diplomacy operations in Ukraine. In fact, Anderson said that he was warned by former National Security Adviser John Bolton that Giuliani was a, quote, \"key voice\" on Ukraine and \"could be an obstacle.\" It was also clear in the testimony that Trump was fixated on the issue of corruption in Ukraine and that he appeared to tie it to a debunked theory that Ukraine interfered in the 2016 elections. Laura Cooper is a Pentagon employee. She testified that military aid to Ukraine was held up for weeks and Pentagon officials were kept in the dark as to why. She told Congress that the order to withhold the funds came from the Office of Management and Budget. And Mick Mulvaney, who is the acting chief of staff at the White House, has been running that division. KING: OK. So a lot of what you have read in these newest documents has corroborated what we've heard before. Let's move forward to tomorrow, a big day... GRISALES: Right. KING: ...On Capitol Hill as this all goes public and televised. GRISALES: Yes. KING: What are we expecting? GRISALES: Yes. So as we get closer to tomorrow's hearing, lawmakers have been filling in more of the blanks of what's to come - kind of pulling back the curtain, if you will, on this weeks-long process behind closed door and these depositions. And three witnesses will testify this week. It's all expected to kick off tomorrow at 10 a.m. And the witnesses are now household names - acting Ambassador to Ukraine Bill Taylor and Deputy Assistant Secretary of State George Kent as well as the former Ambassador to Ukraine Marie Yovanovitch. We also have more clues on the structure of the questioning. Each side will get 45 minutes to ask questions. And - but even with all of this parameter in place, the questioning could go on all day. And of course we know that Adam Schiff will chair these proceedings of the panel. And a key Trump ally, Jim Jordan of Ohio, has been added to the panel, and he'll be asking questions as well. KING: And Claudia, we should note before we let you go that Republicans have a list of witnesses that they want to call. On that list, Joe Biden's son Hunter and the whistleblower. So we shall see how things go from there. NPR's Claudia Grisales, thank you so much for your time. GRISALES: Thanks for having me. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) KING: All right. Now here's something that's become a big geopolitical question or quandary. Who is responsible for foreign fighters who went to Syria to fight for ISIS and then were captured in combat? INSKEEP: By who is responsible, of course we mean, who has to take them and hold them? Well, whoever may be responsible, Turkey says, it isn't us. The country has begun proceedings to return hundreds of fighters from Turkey's prisons to their countries of origin. Some are known to be European. Turkey's Interior Ministry says one is American. And Turkey is trying to send them back just as Turkey's president arrives in Washington this week, where he meets President Trump. KING: NPR's Peter Kenyon has been following all of this from Istanbul. Good morning, Peter. PETER KENYON, BYLINE: Hi, Noel. KING: So some of these guys have been in Turkish prisons for a very long time. Why is the Turkish government pushing so hard now to try to send them home? KENYON: Well, Turkey's been saying for some time now - other countries have got to take these people back; they're your citizens. They went to join these terrorists. Inside Syria, the so-called ISIS caliphate is no more. The U.S. has partially withdrawn forces; some are still there. The regime of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad is trying to move, take control of more parts of the country with Russia's help - very complicated situation. And Turkey's interior minister is saying, look, we are not a hotel for ISIS terrorists. And now it looks like Ankara is trying to force the issue, start removing some of those fighters and family members, raising that question you just mentioned. Where will they wind up? KING: OK. So I wonder what we know about these fighters. Steve mentioned one American, some European. Broadly, do we know where they come from? KENYON: Well, the Interior Ministry says seven Germans are scheduled to be, quote, \"repatriated\" on Thursday. Also, proceedings are aimed at deporting 11 French citizens captured in northern Syria. Other deportations planned for foreign fighters from Ireland, Germany, Denmark. Some European countries now, we have to note, are stripping some of these people of their citizenship. That doesn't make things any easier. But President Erdogan says that doesn't matter; they're going back anyway. And as you mentioned, there's an American in the mix - one foreign fighter described as a U.S. citizen. The latest video has shown him not sent home but in this buffer zone - a no man's land between Turkey and Greece on the land border. There was video showing him hands raised, as if to say - where do I go now? Greek police say they denied him entry twice. President Erdogan said he's not our problem. He did repeat his threat - President Erdogan did - to open the gates and send large numbers of refugees, including ISIS prisoners, towards Europe again. KING: OK. So he is using that as leverage. I want to ask you, lastly, about this American fighter and what we know about him and also about the sort of diplomatic aspect of this because President Erdogan, as Steve said, will be at the White House tomorrow. Is this going to come up between him and President Trump? KENYON: Well, it's likely to come up. But top of the agenda? - hard to say. It'll be competing with a lot of other stuff. Turkey's acquisition of Russian missiles - that's got people saying Turkey doesn't belong in NATO anymore. Turkey's very unhappy with U.S. support for these Syrian Kurdish fighters that Ankara sees as terrorists. There was a deal to move them, and now Turkey's saying that hasn't been fulfilled. But it wasn't the U.S., it was Russia that made that promise and said the Kurdish fighters had been cleared away. So how much can be gained by dealing with the White House on this is open to question. KING: OK. NPR's Peter Kenyon in Istanbul. Peter, thanks so much for your reporting. KENYON: Thanks, Noel.

Kamala Harris, Kirsten Gillibrand and Cory Booker.\n                \n                    \n                    Jim Watson/AFP/Getty Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption Former Vice President Joe Biden was directly challenged by several other candidates, including Sens. Kamala Harris, Kirsten Gillibrand and Cory Booker. Updated at 1 p.m. ET The second night of the Democratic debates in Detroit did not stray from its predicted script: It was open season on front-runner Joe Biden right from the start. But it was also something of a free-for-all, with every candidate for himself or herself. And the intensity and outcome of the exchanges may have come as a surprise to some of the people onstage. Unlike the first night, when two featured performers (Sens. Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren) collaborated against the rest of the field, Wednesday night was an extended crossfire focused on the debaters at center stage. Biden, the clear leader in national polls, stood at the epicenter flashing his toothsome, squinting smile as often as he could \u2014 while also looking befuddled or lost at times. His shorter answers tended to be crisp, while longer ones wandered or lost focus at times. To his left stood Sen. Kamala Harris of California, who at last month's debate in Miami had assailed Biden's onetime stance on school busing and propelled herself into the top tier of candidates. Harris was back with fresh ammunition about Biden's performance on criminal justice and other issues, but the former vice president was prepared this time. Credit:  NPR He began his new approach with a rather cryptic aside to Harris during the introductions, saying with a grin: \"Go easy on me, kid.\" While some saw this as pure Biden badinage, many in the Democratic Twittersphere sensed disrespect in calling a female senator \"kid.\" Harris was in no mood to take it easy, highlighting among other issues the number of deportations carried out while Biden was vice president. Biden came back with a defense of former President Barack Obama's overall approach to immigration, including his Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals initiative for DREAMers. But Biden did not directly answer her accusation regarding deportations. Instead, he compared his own position on busing in an earlier decade to a position Harris herself had advocated at one time. When she criticized him for supporting legislation that swelled the ranks of federal prisoners, Biden came back at Harris' reputation as a tough criminal prosecutor in California. Biden got some backup when one of the lesser-known candidates \u2014 Rep. Tulsi Gabbard of Hawaii, who is also a veteran \u2014 turned on Harris with an accusation that she withheld evidence as a prosecutor that would have helped a defendant in a capital case. Harris, seemingly taken aback by this and other charges from Gabbard, denied the statements and stood by her record \u2014 but also seemed knocked off balance. Standing to Biden's right throughout the evening was Sen. Cory Booker of New Jersey, who scoffed at Biden for saying that he would rejoin the Paris agreement on climate change. \"Nobody should get applause for [that],\" Booker said. \"That is kindergarten.\" As expected, Booker was also eager to critique Biden's history as a Judiciary Committee chairman in the Senate. \"Every crime bill had your name on it,\" he said, adding that Biden and others \"used that phony tough-on-crime rhetoric that got a lot of people elected but destroyed communities like mine.\" Sen. Cory Booker directly challenged former Vice President Joe Biden on criminal justice records during the debate.\n                \n                    \n                    Jim Watson/AFP/Getty Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption Sen. Cory Booker directly challenged former Vice President Joe Biden on criminal justice records during the debate. However, Biden came back with questions about decisions Booker made as mayor of Newark during a period of increased crime, including the use of stop-and-frisk police tactics. Booker was able to absorb that counterpunch and keep going, showing far more energy and engagement than he had in the June debate. His strong but sunny moments going toe-to-toe with Biden may well have made Booker the biggest beneficiary of the night. Former Housing and Urban Development Secretary Juli\u00e1n Castro did not have as many chances to shine as he had in June, but he generally made them count. At one point he joined in upbraiding Biden about positions he took on immigration as vice president. \"It looks like one of us has learned the lessons of history and one of us hasn't,\" he said, to one of the audience's larger bursts of laughter and applause. Not to be outdone, Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand of New York weighed in with a quotation from an op-ed Biden had written decades ago citing family deterioration as an issue when women work outside the home. Biden seemed to shrug, speaking of his own years as a single parent and the careers of his first and second wives. He then recalled how Gillibrand had praised his record in a joint appearance at Syracuse University. \"I don't know what's happened except that you're now running for president,\" he added, to audible approval from the audience. (The crowd had been relatively subdued on Tuesday night but was more boisterous on Wednesday. Several loud protesters were removed after interrupting the proceedings early on.) In format and style, the second CNN debate was almost a clone of the first. Perhaps with an eye toward fair treatment of both panels, the moderators reused some of Tuesday's questions nearly verbatim. And they were just as quick to abbreviate the candidates' responses with a curt \"thank you\" and \"please abide by the rules.\" Once again, the emphasis was on finding points of contention and stoking the tension between individual contestants. Several of the questions quoted one candidate onstage and then asked a second why the first was wrong. And once again, those candidates most willing to continue punching in the clinches were awarded with extra time to do so. Again, by far the most time was devoted to discussing health care and the candidates' competing proposals and plans for dealing with coverage and costs.  At times the blizzard of numbers in the millions, billions and trillions seemed to confuse even the candidates themselves. Only about 15 minutes were allotted for foreign policy and even less time for discussing the possible impeachment of President Trump. In one sense, the only program needed to understand Wednesday night's proceedings in the historic Fox Theatre was a summary of the Quinnipiac University poll released earlier in the week showing Biden moving up in the midsummer weeks, receiving a full one-third of all the votes in a field of two dozen. Harris, by contrast, had lost 8 percentage points and slipped from second place to third. Her 12% trailed Sen. Elizabeth Warren's 15 percentage points and basically tied with Sen. Bernie Sanders' 11%. South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg at 6% was fifth, as he had been in the earlier July 2 Quinnipiac poll. Those who remain mired at 1% or less in national polling risk \"falling off the stage\" when the debating resumes mid-September. The Democratic National Committee has raised the qualifying criteria to 2% in four polls and 130,000 unique donors. By those standards, it is possible the field will winnow to a dozen or fewer candidates by next month. But this week may have scrambled the hierarchy and breathed new life into some of the more marginal candidacies. For example, some believe self-help author Marianne Williamson helped herself enough on Tuesday night to clear the threshold. On Wednesday night, half the stage seemed locked in a survival contest. New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio used his height and voice to his advantage as he hurled challenge after challenge at Biden from the far end of the row of candidates. In marked contrast, at the other far end, Sen. Michael Bennet of Colorado persevered in being soft-spoken and philosophical \u2014 even more than in the June debate. Generous with his rivals (\"you said it better\") he repeatedly returned the focus of the discussion to Trump. A common theme of the night was the need to move beyond intra-party struggles to defeat the incumbent president. Andrew Yang, the tech entrepreneur who supports a universal basic income of $1,000 month for every adult citizen, managed to deliver a steady stream of trenchant observations that led him back to his signature talking point. He also warned that climate change had gone so far that it was time to start moving people \"to higher ground.\" On this issue Yang had the full support of Washington Gov. Jay Inslee, who spoke of climate change in apocalyptic terms and returned to the subject at every opportunity. Inslee said the time had passed to speak only of realistic responses to the challenge, adding \"survival is realistic.\"",

The fates of almost 1 million people brought to the country illegally as children, known as DREAMers, are now in the hands of the U.S. Supreme Court. The court granted an appeal to the Trump administration's decision to end the DACA program, or Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals. The Obama-era program to protect DREAMers will get a one-hour hearing before the high court next term. The court said it would consolidate three appeals into one argument. The program provided temporary legal status and protection from deportation for nearly 800,000 young people who were brought to the U.S. without legal papers when they were children. An immigrant reads a guide of the conditions needed to apply for DACA protection.\n                \n                    \n                    Damian Dovarganes/AP\n                    \n                \nhide caption An immigrant reads a guide of the conditions needed to apply for DACA protection. President Trump sought to revoke their protected status in 2017, seven months after taking office. The administration claimed in court that it could revoke DREAMers' status anytime because the original Obama program was illegal. It also asserted that the courts had no power to review its decision. Four federal appeals courts subsequently rejected those arguments, and the Supreme Court earlier this month refused to expedite high court consideration of the cases. Now, the court will hear arguments next term, with a decision expected a year from now \u2014 just as the 2020 presidential election will be kicking into high gear. While public approval for DREAMers is high \u2014 around 80% in most public opinion polls \u2014 the issues in the case are tricky. Were the administration willing to concede that President Barack Obama acted legally in enacting the program, the Trump administration could rescind the program as long as it provided a good reason and followed the rules for such a policy reversal. But the administration has hinged its legal position on its contention that Obama acted illegally. And that is a tough sell, given that other administrations of both parties have used deferred action to permit certain large categories of people to remain in the United States. The DACA controversy also has been intertwined with politics. President Trump sought to use the program as a bargaining chip to get Democrats to agree to build a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border. And when that failed, and the administration still maintained that DACA was illegal, the administration's  push to get the case into the Supreme Court earlier was seen by some critics as an effort to shift the blame for an unpopular act onto the court. The question of what to do about DREAMers was intensely debated within the Trump administration in the summer of 2017. John Kelly, then the secretary of homeland security, twice declined to close the program. The president's daughter Ivanka and his son-in-law, Jared Kushner, were both said to be DACA supporters, and the president himself had often spoken approvingly about DREAMers, calling them \"great kids\" and expressing his \"love\" for them.",

Legislative districts in Virginia that the Supreme Court previously said were racially gerrymandered have to remain in their redrawn form, the court said Monday, giving Democrats in the state a victory. The majority decision was written by Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, who noted that because the entirety of state government wasn't suing to keep the fight going \u2014 the case was brought by the state's GOP-controlled House \u2014 then it is throwing the case out. \"In short, Virginia would rather stop than fight on,\" Ginsburg wrote. \"One House of its bicameral legislature cannot alone continue the litigation against the will of its partners in the legislative process.\" The court previously decided that 11 districts in the state were sorted by race and they had to be redrawn. They were redrawn, and then the state's GOP-controlled House intervened to take it to the Supreme Court. The case was 5-4, but not along the usual conservative-liberal lines. Instead, the majority in this case was Ginsburg with liberal justices Sonia Sotomayor and Elena Kagan, as well as conservatives Clarence Thomas and Neil Gorsuch. For the number of cases remaining, the court appeared to be clearing out the underbrush Monday. It decided four cases, and none of them in a major way. It also punted a controversial Oregon cake-shop case \u2014 dealing with gay rights vs. religious freedom \u2014 sending it back to a lower court. And it did nothing yet on Trump administration appeals of lower-court rulings that his administration violated the law on DACA, Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals. The court could deal with it by the end of the term, possibly next week. This now leaves 20 undecided cases \u2014 11 of which could be major decisions \u2014 and just one scheduled decision day remaining: June 24.

Underlying many of Booker's points is a belief that it's possible to create bipartisan consensus, even while the partisan divide in America seems to grow ever wider.\n                \n                    \n                    Amr Alfiky/NPR\n                    \n                \nhide caption Cory Booker poses for a portrait at NPR headquarters in Washington, D.C. Underlying many of Booker's points is a belief that it's possible to create bipartisan consensus, even while the partisan divide in America seems to grow ever wider. Sen. Cory Booker talks about politics in grand, even spiritual terms. Speaking to NPR about his run for the presidency, the New Jersey Democrat used phrases like \"coalitions of conscience,\" \"sacred honor\" and \"courageous empathy.\" But those hopeful ideas pose a major challenge for Booker: how to translate his aggressively optimistic view of American democracy into any sort of policy action, especially with such gaping differences between the two parties on a wide range of policy areas. He's the first of the 2020 presidential candidates whom NPR's Morning Edition spoke to in a series of conversations to explore their core campaign messages called Opening Arguments. Host Steve Inskeep interviewed Booker about not only what he wants to accomplish as president, but also why he thinks large (and often progressive) policy leaps are possible. \"The founders were imperfect geniuses. They wrote a lot of our bigotries into [the Constitution]. ... If you think about how we have overcome those things, it's always been by creating, first, calls to consciousness, speaking truth about the injustices, and then bringing together those uncommon coalitions.\" \"We are a nation of conscience, and I found partners on the other side of the aisle who agree with me on these issues. And we can build from there. In fact, when I first came to the Senate, people laughed. I had people telling me, 'There's no way you're going to get a comprehensive criminal justice reform bill done.' \" Underlying many of Booker's points is a firm belief that it's possible to create bipartisan consensus, even while the partisan divide in America seems to grow ever wider. Booker argues that he's the man to create that consensus because of his record as mayor of Newark, where he at times worked with Republican Gov. Chris Christie; his work passing the bipartisan FIRST STEP Act on criminal justice; and legislation he worked on with Sen. Tim Scott, R-S.C., to create \"opportunity zones.\" The basic idea is that investors would get a tax break for putting their recent investment gains into projects in low-income areas. Booker acknowledges that building bridges between Republicans and Democrats will be difficult. He told NPR the story of a Midwestern farm family that at first refused to meet with him. \"They call the person that was showing me around and said, 'Hey we're a Christian family. We can't have Cory Booker in our home.' Because we have these outrage machines that are making the highest corporate profits they've ever made, because of their telling us to hate each other so much,\" Booker said. In the end, however, Booker said he won the family over via \"dad jokes\" and finding some common areas of agreement on farm policy. \"This is a system that just grinds people into it who are the most vulnerable. You know, you can judge a lot by a country by who they incarcerate. \"There are some countries that incarcerate political opposition, some countries that incarcerate the media ... but if you look at our prisons and jails we incarcerate overwhelmingly the addicted, mentally ill, low-income, low-income, low-income folks ... and then disproportionately people of color.\" Criminal justice reform is one of Booker's key policy areas in his presidential policy platform \u2014 he often cites the statistics that the U.S. has 5 percent of the world's population but 25 percent of its incarcerated population. He was a key force behind the FIRST STEP Act, which President Trump signed into law. Among other things, that law ends the \"three-strike penalty\" that gave some offenders automatic life sentences, it helps judges avoid imposing mandatory minimum sentences, and it gives prisoners more access to rehabilitation programs. Booker will soon introduce what he calls the Next Step Act, a package of further criminal justice changes. It includes provisions that would legalize marijuana at the federal level, eliminate the sentencing disparity between crack and powder cocaine, and give felons the right to vote. This is one big area where Booker would likely have an uphill battle with Republicans. A recent Florida measure to give felons the right to vote faced stiff GOP opposition, though it passed and went into effect in January. \"You can judge a lot by a country by who they incarcerate,\" Cory Booker tells NPR.\n                \n                    \n                    Amr Alfiky/NPR\n                    \n                \nhide caption \"You can judge a lot by a country by who they incarcerate,\" Cory Booker tells NPR. \"We were one vote shy from bringing down Medicare eligibility to 55.

I'm going to fight for that one vote when I'm running in 2020, because what would that have done?\" Booker is one among several 2020 presidential candidates backing Bernie Sanders' Medicare-for-all bill. However, he stressed in this interview that he has also backed other, less-sweeping health care proposals, like reducing the Medicare eligibility age to 55, from the current age of 65. He also said that despite pressure from some on the left, he would not eliminate the Senate filibuster to pass a health care overhaul like Medicare-for-all. His reasoning is that without the filibuster, \"the kind of things they could have done in the first two years of the Trump administration would have been so damaging to people.\" \"And we need to understand that there's good reason to have a Senate where we're forced to find pragmatic bipartisan solutions,\" he added. \"Why do we need to universally condemn entire sectors of our society, as opposed to talking about what's happening within them that is in violation of values and creating regulations and rules that make sure that they are affirming what's in the best interest of our country?\" Booker has close ties to the technology industry, even while he has co-sponsored greater regulation on tech companies. A recent piece from Recode's Theodore Schleifer detailed the tension at the heart of this relationship. As tech companies are at the center of discussions about privacy, political misinformation and hate speech, Booker's past friendliness with the industry \u2014 and potential for taking donations from the Silicon Valley elite \u2014 could turn off some progressive voters. Booker is staking out positions critical of tech companies, saying that he supports more regulation on privacy and security issues. He said too few companies control too much of the industry to expect them to self-regulate, and he criticized practices like contracting low-wage jobs, instead of providing corporate benefits to those workers.

Scott Applewhite/AP\n                    \n                \nhide caption The Supreme Court justices, pictured in November 2018, start a new term on Monday. The Supreme Court may be eager to portray itself as an apolitical institution. But this term, political questions writ large are knocking at the high court door. The upcoming term will almost surely be a march to the right on almost every issue that is a flashpoint in American society. Among them: abortion, guns, gay rights, the separation of church and state, immigration and presidential power. Also headed to the court are cases testing the power of Congress to get information from the executive branch and elsewhere, information that is relevant to congressional oversight and potentially, to impeachment. Clearly, President Trump had something like that in mind when he said of the current impeachment inquiry, \"It shouldn't be allowed. There should be a way of stopping it, maybe legally through the courts.\" And if that isn't enough, pending before the court is a sleeper case testing the very structure of our presidential election system. The Supreme Court, by tradition, has tried to stay out of big controversies in an election year. But the justices, even if reticent, don't always have control over their docket. When the lower courts are divided on major questions, the justices cannot always escape their responsibility to be the final decider. Here are themes to watch: Some justices are itching to play their conservative cards The Supreme Court is a very different place since the 2018 retirement of Justice Anthony Kennedy, a centrist conservative, who often cast the deciding vote in closely contested cases. With President Trump's appointment of Justice Brett Kavanaugh to replace him, hard-core conservatives now have a firm majority on the court. And some of them have been itching for quite some time to reverse Roe v. Wade, to expand gun rights, religious rights and more. If there is a new swing justice now, it likely will be Chief Justice John Roberts. But his swings to the left have been rare indeed \u2014 upholding Obamacare in 2012, and seven years later, repudiating the citizenship question on the census. SCOTUSblog publisher Tom Goldstein calls the chief justice \"a solid conservative vote.\" The disagreement among the five justices on the right of the court, he adds, has been, \"How fast do you move?\" Is the right to abortion going to be struck down? The first place that disagreement could become apparent is on abortion, in a case that asks the court to essentially reverse a 2016 decision that struck down a Texas law making it very difficult for clinics that perform abortions to exist. And now the Supreme Court has agreed to hear arguments in a case that presents a nearly identical law from Louisiana. Goldstein, who frequently argues cases before the court, expects the conservative court majority to eventually reverse Roe v. Wade outright, or to hollow it out. \"It's coming.\" he says. \"But nobody knows whether it's in one year, five years, or maybe 10.\" Guns: a major test At a time when voters seem to approve of more gun regulation, the court seems headed in the opposite direction. Before the court is the first major test of gun regulations in the more than 10 years since the justices ruled that there is a constitutional right to own a gun for self-defense in one's home. Court observers have long attributed the hiatus on gun cases to a closely divided court on which neither the four conservatives, nor the four liberals, were sure how Justice Kennedy would cast his deciding vote. But now Kennedy is retired, replaced by Kavanaugh, who as a lower court judge was an outspoken critic of gun regulations and a strong supporter of expansive gun rights. How separate should church and state be? Also before the court this term are major questions involving the separation of church and state. For generations, the court sought to erect a relatively high wall of separation. But that has begun to change, and religious rights advocates are poised to pounce. \"I actually can't recall a time in the last 20 years where there were so many cases ready for decision\" in this area of the law, says Mark Rienzi, president of The Becket Fund for Religious Liberty. In particular, Rienzi and others have set their sights on invalidating or undermining provisions in most state constitutions that bar direct or indirect aid to religious schools. \"The mood music at the court\" is that the justices \"would probably say that's just discrimination on the basis of religion, and that's forbidden by the federal Constitution,\" says former Solicitor General Paul Clement. Can an employer fire an employee because he is gay? On another hot-button issue, the court will hear a case that tests whether employers are free to fire gay employees because of their sexual orientation, or trans employees because of their gender identity. The 1964 Civil Rights Act bars discrimination in employment \"because of sex.\" The fired employees contend that that language protects them from such discharges. The employers argue that the law was never meant to cover gay or transgender employees. A victory for the LGBTQ community would be \"huge,\" says Georgetown University Law professor Paul Smith, who notes that discrimination against gay and trans individuals remains \"rampant,\" especially in the private sector. The Dreamers Then too, there are a variety of immigration cases, the biggest being the Trump administration's attempt to roll back the Obama administration program that continues to protect from deportation some 700,000-800,000 \"Dreamers\" brought to the U.S. by their parents, without legal authorization, when they were children. Presidential power and impeachment Multiple cases are on \"rocket ships headed towards the Supreme Court,\" notes SCOTUSblog's Goldstein. That, he says, is \"because the president has been so aggressive in asserting his immunity from investigations,\" whether they are criminal investigations, subpoenas for his financial records, or potentially records relating to the impeachment inquiry. The court, as Goldstein observes, is going to \"hate the idea\" of tackling these cases in a presidential election year, but \"they may not have a way out.\" Faithless electors, the Electoral College and the 2020 election Finally, pending before the court is a case that could involve the 2020 election. It is a test of \" faithless elector\" laws. These are laws passed in many states that impose penalties on Electoral College delegates or sometimes provide for the removal of electors who refuse to vote for the presidential candidate of their designated party. The question is: Are these laws constitutional? The Supreme Court has never before weighed in on the issue. There have been 167 faithless electors in the history of the United States, and in no case has the outcome of an election turned on the vote of these electors. But there is no guarantee that won't happen in 2020.",

This builds on a blueprint that President Trump and his son-in-law and senior adviser Jared Kushner announced in May and that addressed border security and legal immigration but didn't deal with the millions of people currently in the country illegally, including young people known as Dreamers. \"In Washington, I find a lot of people are very quick to say what they are against,\" Kushner said during a Cabinet meeting at which he shared details of the plan. \"But it's very important for us to articulate as an administration what we're for, but to do it in detail. And we're not afraid to put out details because we think that this proposal is a very very good proposal that really is great for America.\" The push for a new immigration bill comes just days after Trump ignited a furious controversy by tweeting that four non-white members of Congress should \"go back and help fix the totally broken and crime infested places from which they came.\" All four members are American citizens, and three of the four were born in the United States. When the immigration blueprint was first announced, it was greeted with mixed reviews and a heavy dose of skepticism about its political prospects. After that initial burst of energy, Congress seemed to ignore it and the White House stopped talking about it. But Kushner said it remained a top priority. \"The Trump administration, despite what some people say, believes in safe, legal immigration and is against illegal and random migration,\" he said. During the Cabinet meeting, Trump threw his support behind the Kushner-led plan. He called it \"compassionate\" and \"the best of everything.\" \"Our country really has a tremendous immigration gap,\" Trump said, calling the current system a \"maze of complexity.\" This bill, which hasn't been introduced and may not be, was drafted in consultation with about 25 Republican Senate offices and a handful of House Republicans, the official said. The senior administration official said the process included adding items, taking others out and tightening language. \"Now we are at a place where we feel like the bill is substantially complete,\" the official said. It's not clear how having legislative language will get this proposal any closer to becoming law, but the senior administration official said officials had planned to meet with Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy on Tuesday. That meeting has been postponed. McConnell has said that any major immigration effort needs to be bipartisan, but Democrats are unlikely to agree to sweeping border security measures without some kind of protections for the so-called Dreamers, brought to the country illegally as children, or the larger 11 million people in the country illegally. Distrust between the White House and Democrats is at perhaps its highest point. This distrust comes as the administration is being criticized for its handling of detained migrant children, its touting of planned immigration sweeps and its defense of the president's racist comments about several progressive lawmakers. But getting Democratic support is not necessarily the president's objective.  White House officials recognize the challenges gaining support from Democrats, but a senior administration official said part of the goal is unifying key factions of the GOP about a path forward. Supporters say it also should give Republicans something to rally around for the 2020 elections. And Trump said as much in the Cabinet meeting, saying that \"if it doesn't get passed, it's a campaign issue.\" The senior administration official touted support its received from conservative groups and pundits, including Rush Limbaugh and Laura Ingraham. He bragged that they were able to work with twenty-five Senate offices and a dozen House offices without any any leaks. \"While this plan doesn't make every needed change or fulfill every campaign promise, it offers the country a viable path forward in the face of Democrat immigration extremism,\" said RJ Hauman, the government relations director at FAIR, which advocates for stronger immigration enforcement. The plan includes an updated legal immigration system that replaces allowing entry to low-skilled workers with a merit-based system that prioritizes immigrants with special skills. It would also strengthen border security, increase interior enforcement and tighten asylum procedures. The proposal would also include installing a nationwide federal employment verification program, known as E-Verify, federal program to check whether new employees were legally allowed to work. Conservative groups have long pushed for the program, but big business has lobbied against it. But that may be changing. The U.S. Chamber of Commerce, which lobbied Congress against a national E-Verify mandate during the Bush and Obama administrations, has since welcomed the idea as long as it includes an improved guest worker proposal. The National Association of Manufacturers also supports mandatory employment verification system like E-Verify. When asked about the political realities of a Democrat-controlled House of Representatives, a fast-approaching August recess, budget fights and an election year on the horizon, the official returned to what has been a common posture for the Trump White House. \"People in Washington think very conventionally all the time, and immigration is something that has been troubling people for 25 years. Everyone can say what they're against, but nobody can say what they're for,\" the official said. The goal for this document, the official argued, was \"seeing if we can unify the Republicans around this proposal.\" The official readily admitted that the White House could put this out and nothing will happen at all. And \"this will be something that we talk about during the election, but at least the president will be on record saying, 'This is what I am for' in a very detailed capacity.\"",

            "article_content": "A onetime supplier to Donald Trump's Chicago tower is now distributing \"resistance beer\" to support causes the brewer feels have been harmed by the administration's actions.  SCOTT SIMON, HOST: Story now about a small Chicago brewery called 5 Rabbit. It was the first company to break ties with the Trump Organization after the president's infamous comments about Mexican immigrants when he entered the 2016 campaign. Since President Trump's election, the Hispanic-owned beermaker has made a business of brewing protest. It's even the subject of a documentary that premieres this weekend. NPR's Tim Mak has more. TIM MAK, BYLINE: This is how it all started. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: They're bringing drugs. They're bringing crime. They're rapists. And some, I assume, are good people. MAK: This was a big problem for Andres Araya and his wife, who were producing a house beer for the Trump Tower in Chicago. Araya and his partners decided to take a stand and became the first business to cut ties with Trump for this. ANDRES ARAYA: When we hear the comments that he makes, it went in direct opposition to the founding principle of our brewery. MAK: But this came with costs. They had the equivalent of 20,000 pints of beer sitting in their warehouse. ARAYA: It was going to cost us $10,000. That is, basically, our working capital at that moment. MAK: Local bars and restaurants hearing about their ordeal agreed to take the barrels they had on hand and sell it as a generic golden ale but not before workers in Araya's warehouse put a colorful twist on the name. Here's Jason Polevoi, who, along with his colleague Nick Jenkins, produced the documentary we mentioned. JASON POLEVOI: Some of the guys working in the brewery wrote on the keg collars - there's no direct translation from Spanish to English. But the closest is [expletive] your mother. MAK: In Chicago beer circles and on social media, critics began questioning why they had to bring Trump's mother into all of this. Beer historian Liz Garibay, a friend of the brewery founders, suggested something else that wasn't much more polite. LIZ GARIBAY: So as we were on the phone, I said, you know, why don't we just change it to be about his hair, him and his hair? So I suggested call it [expletive] tu pelo, which means [expletive] your hair. MAK: Beer sales took off at Chicago bars friendly with 5 Rabbit, backed by a logo that became an iconic sketch of Trump's tufts made by a local artist. Here's Scott Weiner, who owns a number of restaurants and bars in Chicago. SCOTT WEINER: We sold an extreme amount in a short period of time. MAK: As Trump's campaign ended, 5 Rabbit's founders thought that was the end of the story. But when Trump won the election, they decided to use that same beer recipe and make it into a social justice-themed beer called La Protesta. Each batch benefits a different cause - one for the environment, one on DACA and another on transgender rights. Here's Araya again. ARAYA: We're a small business. But, you know, those small things of just getting involved with organizations that are working towards things that you think are important or just voicing your concerns or getting involved in politics - that matters. MAK: We should point out that The Trump Organization did not comment despite multiple requests. It's been 3 1/2 years since Araya pulled out of Trump Tower in Chicago, and batches of La Protesta are still in demand. Tim Mak, NPR News.

            "article_content": "The Senate is expected to vote this week on a bill to fund the government. TSA staff are working without pay during the government shutdown, and about 10 percent of TSA workers called out sick Sunday.  DAVID GREENE, HOST: So the Senate is expected to vote on a bill this week to fund the government. RACHEL MARTIN, HOST: Yeah, the Senate Appropriations Committee released text of the package last night. It includes President Trump's offer to extend protections for DACA recipients for three years. And in exchange, he would get the $5.7 billion he wants for a border wall. That alone had Democrats calling the deal a nonstarter before it was even written. But it also adds $12.7 billion for natural disaster relief. This is something Democrats have pushed for. So could that sweeten the deal here? GREENE: Well, let's ask that question, among others, to NPR national political correspondent Mara Liasson. Hi, Mara. MARA LIASSON, BYLINE: Hi, David. GREENE: All right, so tell us more about what's in this bill that the Senate's going to be taking a vote on. LIASSON: Well, the bill has disaster relief in it, as you said, as a sweetener. And the big question is, could this proposal of the president's that will be on the Senate floor bring us any closer to the end of the shutdown? And it could. I don't think it's the final deal. But the president is now talking the language of compromise. He's come off the notion that the wall has to be 2,000 miles long. He's added relief for the DREAMers, young people brought here, sometimes illegally, by their parents. This is not the final deal. Democrats would need more. Trump has not said how much less money for the wall he's willing to take than $5.7 billion. But the first step is to see if this can get 60 votes on the Senate floor. Democrats say it can't. But then they'll have to keep talking. GREENE: Will they have to keep talking? I mean, so far Democrats have basically said to the president, we're not going to talk, at least publicly saying, we're not going to talk until you open the government. But - but you think this is a window. I mean, Democrats are going to be forced to actually start negotiating and getting to some of the nitty gritty here. LIASSON: Yes, I do. I think that usually, in the past, when we've had these standoffs, there's a mechanism where the government is reopened week by week. They have to keep on voting while they keep on talking. Vice President Pence said on television yesterday this wasn't a final offer. He said the legislative process is a negotiation. That sounded so normal. GREENE: (Laughter). LIASSON: But I do think you're going to hear more from Democrats about their vision of border security. If the argument is about border security, the president wins. If it's about a wall, the Democrats win. And I think that they are going to start talking more about their vision of what they want on the border. GREENE: Mara, can I ask you more about what the president was offering on this - the DACA protection for three years? Because, I mean, most Republicans have been standing by him through this and supporting this deal. But some of his supporters are calling that DACA offer amnesty. Could that hurt him with part of his base? LIASSON: Well, that's always the big question. I think right now Republicans in Congress are pretty united behind him. And yes, the and cultures of the world, radio talk show hosts, are calling this amnesty. But Republicans in Congress want the government open because they're being blamed for the shutdown, so far more than Democrats are. Republicans I've talked to say that Trump's hold on his base is firm enough that he probably could get some relief for the DREAMers in here. The big question is, could he go all the way to a path to citizenship, which is going to be hard since that's been defined as amnesty by the vice president? Where is the sweet spot? How much less money could he get for the wall, and how much deportation relief would he have to offer for the DREAMers? GREENE: Many questions to answer as we go forward and as that partial government shutdown for now continues. NPR's Mara Liasson. Thank you, Mara. LIASSON: Thank you. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) GREENE: Let's talk more about this shutdown. More than 50,000 TSA employees have been working without pay since the partial government shutdown began over a month ago now. MARTIN: Yeah, and they're getting help from some unusual corners. Members of the band Kiss have been offering them free food at airport locations of their restaurant, which is called Rock and Brews. Here's Kiss band member Paul Stanley in a Facebook video. (SOUNDBITE OF FACEBOOK VIDEO) PAUL STANLEY: While the TSA continues to work on our behalf without pay, we want to make sure that we can at least provide them with a delicious meal to show our support. MARTIN: But more and more TSA workers are actually just calling out sick altogether, as many as 1/10 this past Sunday. TSA released a statement saying that many of those employees said they can't get to work because of financial limitations. GREENE: Let's talk to NPR's David Schaper in Chicago. He's been covering this. Hi there, David. DAVID SCHAPER, BYLINE: Good morning. GREENE: So it's amazing. As I've been going through airports and going through security lines, it seems like every passenger says to a TSA employee, like, thank you for working without pay. And it sounds like it's now getting to a point where more and more are having to call out sick. What are they telling you about this decision? SCHAPER: Well, as you guys just said, they're not actually saying (imitating cough) I'm sick; I can't come in. They're really not able to go in because of the financial limitations. You know, working without pay for a TSA employee is a difficult thing because they're among the lowest paid federal government employees. They make about 35 to $43,000 a year on average. That's about 17 to 20 bucks an hour. So a lot of them live just paycheck to paycheck or do just a little bit better than that. And so while the vast majority are still working their shifts, more and more of them are saying they've got to go do something else to make a little more cash. They've got to put food on the table. So they're going to pick up work elsewhere, working odd jobs, waiting tables, whatever they can find. Or they'll stay home, stay home with the kids so a spouse can pick up extra shifts or so they just don't have that extra expense of childcare during the day. GREENE: So a lot of hard decisions, obviously, the shutdown clearly disrupting life for them, their families. What impact is this or could this have on travel and airports if this goes on? SCHAPER: Well, at this point we're not seeing, you know, flights canceled, flight delays and people missing flights. But we are starting to see more and more airports closing security checkpoints because of a shortage of screeners and lines getting longer at certain airports. You know, there - there were a bunch of extra screeners added to airports in Atlanta, at LaGuardia in New York, at the Newark Airport. There were long lines, apparently, over the weekend in New Orleans, at Baltimore-Washington Airport because they had closed checkpoints. Houston's had some problems. It depends on the airport and how many employees in that - in that particular area are calling in. But it hasn't just grown to that point yet of where we're going to see canceled flights and huge disruptions to air travel. GREENE: Is it just airport security employees? Or are there other employees at airports who are impacted by the shutdown? SCHAPER: No, actually the FAA has hundred - has thousands of inspectors, technicians and safety specialists who inspect the planes, who, you know, do everything from licensing pilots to making sure that the air traffic control equipment is working properly. And they are working without pay. A lot of them weren't actually considered safety critical and essential employees when the shutdown began. But a lot of them got called back to work last week and are on the job now. But they're going to have the same sort of financial troubles soon if they have to to keep working and keep doing these important jobs without pay. And that's where the ripple effect could come, where - where air travel could be affected. GREENE: NPR's David Schaper, talking to us from Chicago. David, thanks. SCHAPER: My pleasure. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) GREENE: All right, now we want to talk about the political turmoil in Venezuela and what's looking like an uncertain future for that country's leader. MARTIN: Yeah, officers in the National Guard in Venezuela basically went rogue and posted a video on social media early Monday morning. (SOUNDBITE OF VIDEO) UNIDENTIFIED VENEZUELAN NATIONAL GUARDSMAN: (Speaking Spanish). MARTIN: So in this video they are calling people to the streets to support their uprising against the president, Nicolas Maduro. The attempt is the latest in a whole string of calls to remove Maduro from power. The Venezuelan president was sworn into his second term earlier this month. But many, including the United States, have called Maduro's government illegitimate. He faces an opposition-run congress that is calling for the military to turn against him. GREENE: And NPR's Philip Reeves is in Caracas covering all of this. And Phil, start if you can by telling us exactly what unfolded here yesterday. PHILIP REEVES, BYLINE: Well, it's not entirely clear. The authorities say that in the early hours, a group of National Guardsmen in Caracas took a police captain hostage, travelled across town in several military trucks, kidnapped four more officers, raided an outpost, stole a bunch of weapons and then were captured after some sort of confrontation just before that - that video was posted online calling on people to abandon Maduro. And other videos appeared too. And now the government says that 27 guardsmen have been arrested and will face what they describe as the full weight of the law. GREENE: Well, talk to me about the broader political situation here because while this was members of the National Guard, some officers who turned against him, Maduro is focusing his criticism on congress, saying congress is trying to destabilize the country. What exactly is he talking about? REEVES: Yeah, congress, or the National Assembly, as it's called here, is opposition-controlled. And it's long been opposed to Maduro and the ruling Socialist Party. In fact, Maduro and the party have stripped it of all its powers. But now it's launching a new drive to oust him, arguing that his second term, which has just begun, is illegitimate because it was the result of a fraudulent election. And in this, the National Assembly has the support of the U.S. and dozens of other countries who are also stepping up pressure right now on Maduro. And the National Assembly also has a new young leader. He's 35, Juan Guaido. And he has said that he's willing to be an interim president for a transitional period leading to new elections if the public supports that and, crucially, if the military supports that. GREENE: Phil, I mean, we've talked about with you how hard it has been for people in Venezuela. This country has been through so much economic turmoil of late. I mean, how shaky is this political moment? Could Maduro lose his grip on power? And could there be a real period of chaos and uncertainty going forward? REEVES: Well, the country is in terrible shape. But remember, Maduro still controls the supreme court. He still appears to have the support of the top military command. And he still has the all-powerful legislature that he created last year, the constituent assembly, which is packed with his supporters. He still has that at his disposal. But things do appear to be moving. The opposition's called for a nationwide day of protest on Wednesday. They're expecting a big turnout. We'll have to see. But there's a lot of buzz about it online. GREENE: NPR's Philip Reeves this morning in Caracas, Venezuela. Phil, thank you. REEVES: You're most welcome. (SOUNDBITE OF MEMORY'S \"OUTERSPACE\") Copyright \u00a9 2019 NPR.  All rights reserved.

            "article_content": "President Trump unveiled a plan to overhaul immigration. This has been a key issue for the president. A look back at the administration's track record on immigration reform.  SCOTT SIMON, HOST: Immigration has been a central issue for President Trump from the time of his campaign. He's announced a plan to overhaul legal immigration in the United States. It would replace the current system with a so-called merit-based system that favors immigrants who are younger and have more desirable skills. But House Speaker Nancy Pelosi has declared the plan, quote, \"dead on arrival.\" NPR's Joel Rose has been looking back at what the White House has accomplished on immigration, and what it hasn't. Joel, thanks so much for being with us. JOEL ROSE, BYLINE: Glad to be here. SIMON: What stood out to you in this immigration proposal? ROSE: I was struck by how quickly it was rejected by people on both sides of the debate, right? Immigration hard-liners hated it because it doesn't cut the number of legal immigrants. In fact, it keeps the number of green cards per year roughly the same. And Democrats didn't like it because it doesn't address any of their key concerns on immigration, like the fate of the DREAMers, young immigrants who were brought to the country illegally as children. Or, really, it doesn't deal with any of the roughly 11 million immigrants living in the country illegally. And even the president himself doesn't really seem to believe that this proposal is going anywhere. Here he is speaking on Thursday. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: And if for some reason, possibly political, we can't get the Democrats to approve this merit-based high-security plan, then we will get it approved immediately after the election, when we take back the House, keep the Senate and, of course, hold the presidency. ROSE: But let's remember that Republicans did control both houses of Congress and the presidency for two years and that they couldn't pass the last immigration plan that the White House supported when they did. SIMON: Which raises the question of what kind of track record they have. ROSE: Well, we recently created an online tool to track the Trump administration's immigration policies. And what stands out to me is really how much of a mixed bag it is. You've got a few high-profile victories, a few perhaps equally high-profile defeats and a whole lot of question marks in between. And you can see that just looking at this week. There's the overhaul plan that's probably not going anywhere. And just yesterday, a second federal appeals court in Maryland ruled against the administration's decision to end DACA, the program that protects almost 700,000 DREAMers. And the Justice Department lawyers on Friday were in court in California defending the national emergency declaration that the White House is using to try to build the wall on the U.S.-Mexico border. SIMON: Courts have often stopped the administration's plans, haven't they? ROSE: They have. I mean, the list is long. The Justice Department has tried to punish so-called sanctuary cities. Courts rejected that. There's temporary protected status. The Department of Homeland Security tried to end protections for hundreds of thousands of immigrants from Haiti and El Salvador and other troubled countries. Courts put that on hold. And one of the most dramatic defeats for this administration was the repudiation of the family separation policy. Courts told the administration to reunite thousands of children with their parents. The administration is still in litigation over that. In fact, they're still in court over the travel ban on immigrants and visitors from seven countries, including several majority-Muslim countries. As we know, the Supreme Court upheld that policy in a big win for the White House, but there are still some lingering constitutional questions. SIMON: So two years into his administration, how has President Trump made U.S. immigration policy different? ROSE: Well, for sure, deportations and arrests of immigrants in the country illegally are way up since Trump took office. Refugee admissions are down. They're at their lowest levels in decades. And in general, I think the administration has been the most successful when it's stuck to things that are clearly in the executive branch's wheelhouse, like rules, regulations that each new administration gets to write. For example, it's taking a lot longer to get a visa or a citizenship than it did a few years ago. That's a big difference because of additional hoops that immigrants have to jump through. And immigration experts say that it's small changes like that that actually can really add up to a big difference. Sarah Pierce is an analyst at the nonpartisan Migration Policy Institute in Washington. SARAH PIERCE: They've made small tweaks to regulations and policy that I think overall, you know, over time and once they're all put together will make a big difference in reducing the amount of immigrants that are coming into the country. ROSE: So some of the administration's most visible policy proposals might be stalled. But in the long run, Pierce is saying that the Trump administration may be successful in making lasting changes to the immigration system. SIMON: NPR's Joel Rose, thanks so much for being with us. ROSE: You're welcome, Scott. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) Copyright \u00a9 2019 NPR.  All rights reserved.  Visit our website terms of use and permissions pages at www.npr.org for further information.

            "article_content": "After taking control of the House of Representatives, Democrats plan to pass spending bills to re-open agencies affected by the partial government shutdown. President Trump has said he opposes them.  AUDIE CORNISH, HOST: Democrats now officially control the House of Representatives, and Nancy Pelosi is once again speaker of the House. The transfer of power on the Capitol comes in the middle of an increasingly drawn-out shutdown of a quarter of the federal government. Later tonight, some of the first votes of the new Congress will be a Democratic effort to end that shutdown. It's expected to pass the House, but Senate Republicans and President Trump say they won't take it seriously. NPR congressional correspondent Scott Detrow is on the Capitol. He joins us now, and let's start with this big shift. How much of a difference will the new majority make? SCOTT DETROW, BYLINE: A big difference. Democrats already have the votes to block or approve a funding deal since the Senate needs 60 votes. And Republicans don't have that. But Democrats never had the power to do what they'll do later today. And that's write bills with what they want in them and call for a vote on them when they want. They can now set the agenda, and that's a big difference. So today after winning her election to become speaker of the House again, Nancy Pelosi stuck to big themes talking about broader Democratic priorities. But she did briefly address the funding bill in her speech. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) NANCY PELOSI: We will do so... (APPLAUSE) PELOSI: We will do so to meet the needs of the American people, to protect our borders and to respect our workers. CORNISH: What exactly is in the House bill? DETROW: So there are going to be two different measures. The first one is a short-term funding bill for the Department of Homeland Security. That's a funding area that's the focal point of this dispute, right? President Trump wants that $5 billion for a border wall. The Democratic bill does not include it, and it would go into early February and give more time for negotiations. The second bill would fund the rest of the unfunded departments through September. That's the rest of the fiscal year. Pelosi is calling this a Republican bill because it passed unanimously in the Republican-controlled Senate last month. Of course that was before President Trump reversed course and decided he wouldn't sign a measure that did not include wall funding. He is sticking to that - and because of that, Majority Leader Mitch McConnell in the Senate says he would not call this Democratic bill - these bills to the floor in the Senate. CORNISH: We're now nearly two weeks into this shutdown. Any signs that either side is seeing any political fallout? DETROW: You know, for the most part, no. Neither side is acting like it. That's such a big difference from previous shutdowns. Go to the Democratic-forced shutdown from about a year ago which Senate Democrats did in order to try and force some action on the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program. In that case just days into it, Democrats realized they were getting the blame for the shutdown. And they reversed course. Here, both sides mostly feel confident. But the longer it goes on, the more real-world repercussions there will be. Federal employees will start to actually hit paydays and not get paychecks. More services will shut down. Here in Washington, the Smithsonian museums closed a few days ago. They had been using reserved money up until that point. Most of Republicans are confident. Here's something that Republican Minority Whip Liz Cheney said at the beginning of the congressional session today. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) LIZ CHENEY: Leader McCarthy led us in passing legislation to secure our borders, keep our nation safe, end the devastating practice of sanctuary cities and - yes, madam clerk - build the wall. (APPLAUSE) DETROW: But we are starting to see little, tiny cracks on the Republican side, and that's notable. Colorado Senator Cory Gardner and Maine Senator Susan Collins both told news outlets today they want to see a resolution even without the wall funding. And that matters because they are both up for re-election next year in more moderate states. CORNISH: What happens next? DETROW: Next thing to look for - there's a meeting scheduled for tomorrow morning at the White House with the president and legislative leaders from both parties. CORNISH: That's NPR congressional correspondent Scott Detrow. Scott, thank you. DETROW: Sure thing. Copyright \u00a9 2019 NPR.  All rights reserved.

            "article_content": "Congressional leaders head back to the White House as the shutdown rolls on. We examine some of the claims the president made in his speech. Lifetime's Surviving R. Kelly generates a lot of interest.  STEVE INSKEEP, HOST: What, if anything, changed after President Trump and Democrats made their case on a border wall? DAVID GREENE, HOST: Well, we might find out today. Congressional leaders are going to be meeting with the president. Last night, the president asked the American people to reach out to them. (SOUNDBITE OF OVAL OFFICE ADDRESS) PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: To every citizen, call Congress and tell them to, finally, after all of these decades, secure our border. GREENE: The president blocked routine government spending measures unless they include money for a border wall. He raised the specter of drugs and crime. Afterwards, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer responded. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) NANCY PELOSI: Much of what we heard from President Trump throughout this senseless shutdown has been full of misinformation and even malice. The president has chosen fear. INSKEEP: NPR national political correspondent Mara Liasson was listening to the speeches and joins us this morning. Hi there, Mara. MARA LIASSON, BYLINE: Hi, there. INSKEEP: So the president used the bully pulpit, as they say. Did you feel any sign of movement or change last night? LIASSON: I didn't hear any sign of movement. There was nothing in the speech that offered a new compromise, no kind of legalize the DREAMers in exchange for wall funding - that's a compromise that both sides flirted with a while ago. So I think unless congressional leaders and the president come up with something we didn't hear last night today, I don't think we'll make progress in these meetings because neither side is hurting enough politically yet. INSKEEP: Well, you said hurting enough. This is a war of attrition, isn't it? Each side is seeing who can suffer more. Were there any arguments the president laid out that would seem damaging to Democrats over the long term? LIASSON: Well, I think the president had three goals last night. One is he needed to convince people outside of his hard core base that shutting down the government to get funding for the wall is a good idea. And Democrats are pretty confident that that won't work. They say this was litigated in 2018. The president's message in the election was all about an invading caravan, and it didn't work. So they're pretty dug in. The second goal, of course, was to keep Republicans from abandoning ship and starting to vote with Democrats to reopen the government, something a small handful of Republicans have already done in the House and about three Senate Republicans who are up in 2020 have been calling for. And the third goal, I think, was to show his base that he's fighting and to lay the groundwork for what might be the endgame of this whole debate, which is declaring a national emergency on the border - doing it himself, doing an end run around Congress. INSKEEP: Mara, is there some vulnerability for Democrats? Because there are a number of Democrats in Congress who, in past years, in other situations, have voted for funding for various kinds of fences and border barriers. LIASSON: I think that's probably the strongest argument the president made. In the last continuing resolution - government funding resolution he signed, the Democrats said, you can spend this money explicitly. The language in the bill was, you can spend this money on steel fencing, but you can't build a concrete wall. And he's saying now, fine; I'll build a steel fence. So you know, he's saying, you approved this money for this kind of barrier in the past. Why don't you do it again? INSKEEP: OK. Thanks very much. That's NPR national political correspondent Mara Liasson. Now let's check some of the facts in the president's speech. GREENE: Yeah. And it's worth noting, there was one notable omission in the speech. The president never said the word terror last night. This week, the White House has backed off claims about the number of terrorists crossing the border. INSKEEP: Yeah. There were questions about some numbers the White House was throwing around. NPR's Joel Rose covers immigration, listened to what was there. Good morning, Joel. JOEL ROSE, BYLINE: Good morning, Steve. INSKEEP: And let's start with the president's dramatic language about people who are in the United States illegally, committing crimes. (SOUNDBITE OF OVAL OFFICE ADDRESS) TRUMP: How much more American blood must we shed before Congress does its job? INSKEEP: OK. There are dramatic cases. The president alluded to some of them. But are immigrants, statistically, more dangerous than anybody else, Joel? ROSE: No. Immigrants are actually less likely than native-born people to commit crimes. But this is a technique that the president has used a lot, going back to his campaign, to point to individual anecdotes with sympathetic crime victims. For example, last night, he talked about an incident - a police officer in California who was allegedly killed by an undocumented immigrant in December. The president also brought up MS-13, the violent street gang, which he does with some regularity. But by focusing on these gruesome examples, his critics say he is exaggerating the overall threat from immigrants and playing on fear. By the way, the police officer who was killed in California that the president called an American hero - also an immigrant, from Fiji. INSKEEP: Well, the president also repeated a claim that he has made on Twitter. Let's listen to that. (SOUNDBITE OF OVAL OFFICE ADDRESS) TRUMP: Our southern border is a pipeline for vast quantities of illegal drugs, including meth, heroin, cocaine and fentanyl. INSKEEP: OK. This does seem basically true. Right? A lot of drugs do come north from Latin America. ROSE: Absolutely. But most of those drugs come through in cars and trucks that pass through legal ports of entry. So it's not actually clear that a border wall would do anything to slow them down or stop them. INSKEEP: Oh, oh - so this is a version of the concern about people who come to the United States illegally, also through legal ports of entry. They come with a visa and overstay the visa. The law wouldn't affect them, either. ROSE: And they are the largest share of people who are becoming undocumented immigrants. That's right. INSKEEP: OK. Well, there's one other claim the president made that we want to check. Let's give a listen to this. (SOUNDBITE OF OVAL OFFICE ADDRESS) TRUMP: The wall will also be paid for, indirectly, by the great new trade deal we have made with Mexico. INSKEEP: OK. This is vital, Joel Rose, because the president and his campaign didn't say - we're going to build a wall, and Congress and American taxpayers will pay for it. He said - we're going to build a wall, and Mexico will pay for it. Now he's saying this is how Mexico is going to pay for it, through this trade agreement. Is there some provision in the new North American Free Trade deal to pay for wall construction? ROSE: Not directly, no. I mean, the president is talking about the United States-Mexico-Canada agreement, which was signed by the leaders of the three countries in November. Trump has repeatedly claimed that that new pact would usher in huge economic benefits for the U.S., essentially making up for the cost of the border wall. But there are two big problems with this argument. First, the agreement has yet to be approved by Congress, and that is not a sure thing. So any conclusions about how much money it's going to bring in are premature. And second, many economists say the new agreement is just a modest reworking of NAFTA, the North American Free Trade Agreement that it is supposed to replace. They are skeptical that it's going to do much to really boost economic growth in the U.S. INSKEEP: And very briefly, the Democrats didn't speak very long. Were there any factual concerns in their short statements? ROSE: Well, one thing to note that I think you kind of hit on already with Mara - but the Senate minority leader, Chuck Schumer, has said that Democrats and the president both want stronger security; however, they disagree about the most effective way to do it. However, as the president did point out last night, congressional Democrats, including Schumer, have sometimes supported border barriers in the past. INSKEEP: Joel, thanks very much. ROSE: You're welcome. INSKEEP: That's NPR's Joel Rose. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) INSKEEP: All right. What are the consequences for R. Kelly after a documentary series focused on sexual abuse allegations? GREENE: Yeah. Lifetime says more than 2 million viewers have watched the \"Surviving R. Kelly\" series. It tells the stories of women who say the multiplatinum R&B artist abused them, isolated them, also had sex with them - some when they were underage. Accusers say Kelly ran a sex cult in Georgia and in Chicago. Kim Foxx, the state's attorney in Cook County, Ill., is now inviting other possible victims to tell their stories. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) KIM FOXX: Please come forward. There is nothing that can be done to investigate these allegations without the cooperation of both victims and witnesses. GREENE: And we should say, there has been a debate over why there wasn't more outcry and more investigation sooner. That debate is growing louder and louder on social media. INSKEEP: And NPR TV critic Eric Deggans has been listening. Hi there, Eric ERIC DEGGANS, BYLINE: Hi. INSKEEP: What kinds of conversations are you seeing and hearing? DEGGANS: Well, there's a lot of conversation and a lot of attention being paid to this series. As you noted, 2 million people watched the debut. But over the course of this six-part series, Lifetime is saying something like 18.8 million people have watched it and that it's also their most talked-about series on social media in the network's history, which gives you the sense that people are talking about it on social media. And the conversation we're seeing is this idea of, can you separate the artist from his music? There are fans out there who want to still enjoy sentimental hits, like \"I Believe I Can Fly\" and \"Step In The Name Of Love\" from R. Kelly. They're important in their personal history. But people are also pointing out and the docu-series makes the argument that he's used the wealth that he's amassed from these hits to build a strategy for grooming young women, for imprisoning young women, for abusing young women. And so people are arguing that you can't really separate those two things. And it's forcing a conversation about pedophilia, sexual abuse and even believing black women when they speak out about abuse within black communities across the country, which seems to be the most impressive result. INSKEEP: Eric, is this case a little like Bill Cosby's case in that the allegations were sort of known for quite some time but, finally, we've hit a moment where people are really paying attention? DEGGANS: I think that that dynamic is definitely happening. I interviewed Dream Hampton, one of the executive producers on the series, and she told me that, for some people, ideas like this don't really become concrete until they really see it on television. And there was something very striking about watching this docu-series and seeing woman after woman come forward. All of the women featured in the docu-series have made their allegations public before, but this is the first docu-series to bring them all together in one very potent story that covers from the beginning of R. Kelly's career in Chicago all the way up until the present day. And we're in this moment where we're seeing people look at the work of Louis C.K. and Kevin Spacey and Bill Cosby and go back and sort of say - you know, there were things that we heard about these guys that maybe we shrugged off or maybe we didn't pay enough attention to. And again, this idea of believing women when they step forward to tell stories of abuse - and I think in this #MeToo moment that we're experiencing now, there's an effort to do that more. And so it's causing us to go back and relook at these incidents. And R. Kelly is the focus of this now. INSKEEP: What did you mean earlier, Eric, when you suggested that women of color might be treated differently as accusers than white women? DEGGANS: Well, Chance the Rapper, this famous musician, just did a video interview where he talked about that, where he talked about - saying that working with R. Kelly was a mistake. And one of the reasons why he may have paid short shrift to some of the allegations about R. Kelly is because he didn't fully believe black women when they stepped forward. And I think a lot of people are having that conversation now, thanks to this docu-series. INSKEEP: Wow. Eric, thanks so much. Really appreciate it. DEGGANS: Thank you. INSKEEP: That's NPR's Eric Deggans. (SOUNDBITE OF AFLUEN SONG, \"1412\") INSPECTAH DECK: (Rapping) I move through the Third World. My third eye's the guiding light. Copyright \u00a9 2019 NPR.

            "article_content": "The partial government shutdown, already the longest in U.S. history, continues with no end in sight.  LULU GARCIA-NAVARRO, HOST: The government shutdown over the border wall continues. Here this morning to talk about the political action or lack thereof is NPR's Mara Liasson. Hi, Mara. MARA LIASSON, BYLINE: Hi, Lulu. GARCIA-NAVARRO: OK. So, Mara, last night, the president called into Judge Jeanine Pirro's show on Fox News. And we'll talk Russia elsewhere in the show. But he said about the shutdown that he was still thinking about declaring a national emergency. Is that still a plan? LIASSON: Well, like everything else about Trump and the shutdown, it's unclear. He's been ping-ponging around this issue. Sometimes, he says he definitely would declare a state of emergency. Other times, he's said he's not in any rush. But that endgame of declaring a national emergency has been described to me by Trump's advisers as the only plausible way out of this for him politically, a way for him to keep faith with his base, show him - show them he's fighting, even if he's stymied in the courts. And this promise to build a wall or, really, do everything he can to build a wall has become the sun, moon and stars of his administration. It's really become the white whale. It's become the No. 1 priority. And he's gotten pretty sensitive about press coverage of how he's handling this issue. He tweeted that the fake news Washington Post said he didn't have a plan. But he says, I have a plan. But to understand the plan, you have to understand that I won the election. The promise with that - problem with that is he did win the 2016 election. But he lost the 2018 election, and he really hasn't absorbed the changes that that's brought. He also tweeted, quote, \"there's almost nobody in the White House but me.\" And I think that really sums it up. It's just him, almost all by himself, making it up as he goes along. GARCIA-NAVARRO: Do we know where he's landed on declaring a state of emergency? You're describing this sort of back and forth. But do we know where his head's at? LIASSON: It seems that he's saying, I will do it if I can't get a deal. But the waffling around this is happening because some of his advisers say it's not a good idea. It's going to be tied up in the courts. The Republicans in Congress are split on this. Some Republicans say it would usurp Congress's power of the purse. Others say it's a terrible precedent because a future Democratic president could declare a state of emergency around gun safety or health care or climate change. But other Republicans on the Hill privately would be thankful for the president to take this whole issue off their laps because if he does declare a state of emergency, he would, presumably, have to open the government. GARCIA-NAVARRO: All right. So where do we stand on the negotiations right now? LIASSON: Nowhere. We're nowhere. Negotiations usually have a couple things associated with them - first of all, round the clock talks, a willingness for both sides to find a deal where both sides would win or maybe a creative solution that makes the problem bigger, like exchanging a path to citizenship for the DREAMers with $25 billion for a wall. That was a deal that was tentatively made over a year ago, but Trump walked away from that. The other reason we're not anywhere is that Mitch McConnell, the Senate Republican leader, is nowhere to be seen. He is the guy who, in the past, has gotten presidents out of a lot of tight corners. He thinks of creative solutions. But don't forget; this whole shutdown started when McConnell passed - unanimously - a compromise bill through the Senate for - to open the government not fund the wall. Trump originally said he would sign it. Then Trump changed his mind, and the shutdown happened. And now McConnell says he's not going to put anything on the floor of the Senate if the president won't sign it. GARCIA-NAVARRO: And Nancy Pelosi, of course, is in Puerto Rico. So it's not like, you know, she's here right now talking to the president either. So I guess, you know, this leaves him taking his case to the American people. He tried to do that when he actually went and gave an address in the Oval Office. Did that move the needle? LIASSON: It doesn't seem like he's moved the needle. He did a lot of things - Oval Office address, trip to the border, a lot of interviews. The latest polling we have is a Washington Post/ABC News poll that shows by a very wide margin - 53 to 29 percent - more Americans blame President Trump and the Republicans in Congress for the shutdown rather than Democrats. One thing that has happened in the polling is that the border wall has gotten a little bit more popular. It's still net unpopular right now. Forty-two percent of people say they support a wall. That's up from 34 percent a year ago. But 54 percent oppose the idea, down from 63 percent a year ago. And the other thing we see is that he hasn't been able to convince Americans that there's actually a crisis on the border. That hasn't worked mostly because the people who are coming across are applying for asylum. That's a legal process, and it wouldn't be stopped by a wall. GARCIA-NAVARRO: That's NPR's Mara Liasson.

            "article_content": "President Trump uses his Twitter feed the way past presidents used the White House briefing room. It's the place where he announces policy and delivers his message to the American people. And it's also the place where he, often gleefully, tries to skewer his political opponents. As the House Democrats' impeachment inquiry continues and Trump's own reelection efforts gather speed, an NPR analysis shows that Trump's broadsides against Democrats in Congress have intensified since July. And his language about nonwhite lawmakers has also grown more heated. NPR examined Trump's tweets, both positive and negative, about every single current member of Congress starting from his Inauguration Day until last week. As of Oct. 4, Trump had tweeted more than 700 times about sitting members of Congress. While Trump has always spread his insults far and wide, the volume of personal insults and extreme language that he directed at the so-called \"squad\" of four Democratic congresswomen and African American Rep. Elijah Cummings over the summer stood out. He kicked off his tweetstorm in mid-July with a Twitter thread that embraced racist tropes, urging members of the \"squad\" \u2014 all women of color \u2014 to \"go back\" to the \"totally broken and crime infested places from which they came.\" Trump would go on to tweet about the \"squad\" \u2014 Ilhan Omar of Minnesota, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York, Ayanna Pressley of Massachusetts and Rashida Tlaib of Michigan \u2014 nearly 20 times collectively in about three months. Loading... That's more negative tweets than Trump has aimed at presidential candidates Elizabeth Warren or Bernie Sanders in the nearly three years he has been president. Among other things, he has called the squad \"a very racist group of troublemakers\" and claimed they hate the United States. The \u201cSquad\u201d is a very Racist group of troublemakers who are young, inexperienced, and not very smart. They are pulling the once great Democrat Party far left, and were against humanitarian aid at the Border...And are now against ICE and Homeland Security. So bad for our Country! That language speaks to some white Trump supporters who may be worried about the country's changing demographics, says Niambi Carter, a political science professor at Howard University. \"When he says 'Make America Great Again' and points to these women as the sort of embodiment of everything that America isn't: It's not black. It's not a woman. It's not Muslim. It's not Latina ... these women become perfect vehicles for all of that xenophobia and all of that anxiety that these white voters feel,\" Carter said. Omar, in particular, has been a top target for Trump on Twitter and off. Including tweets about the \"squad\" and tweets that single her out, Trump has tweeted about her 29 times. By comparison, he tweeted about Ocasio-Cortez 22 times. Trump is holding a rally in the heart of Omar's district in Minneapolis on Thursday. At a campaign rally in North Carolina in July, the crowd echoed Trump's tweets and chanted \"send her back\" about Omar, who was born in Somalia, but is an American citizen. These sorts of attacks have a long running history, said Pearl Dowe, a political science and African American studies professor at Emory University. \"This is an ongoing struggle for people of color to have their citizenship respected, to actually live out their full citizenship, but also their humanity as well,\" Dowe said. \"The president chooses his targets pretty carefully\" The White House did not respond to interview requests for this story, but Trump supporters generally say that the president is a counterpuncher who responds to people who attack him, no matter who they are. The review of Trump's tweets shows that he does go after critics, but not everyone gets the same treatment or attention. The only lawmakers with more negative tweets than the squad and Cummings are top Democrats: House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer and House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff. Loading... Other lawmakers who regularly criticize Trump, like former presidential candidate Eric Swalwell, barely get a mention in the president's Twitter feed. The same is true for senators and presidential candidates Kamala Harris and Cory Booker. \"The president chooses his targets pretty carefully but he doesn't always choose them for the same reason,\" said Brian Ott, a communications professor at Texas Tech University and co-author of The Twitter Presidency. Ott said Trump uses Twitter to discredit politicians he views as a threat and to distract from other matters. \"There's this other motivation, which is trying to define the opposition, and it's clear that he takes tremendous pleasure and is particularly vitriolic when it comes to characterizing women and ethnic minorities on Twitter,\" he said. On Twitter, Trump has said the face of the Democratic Party is the \"squad,\" Pelosi and Rep. Maxine Waters, who is African American. Representatives Omar and Tlaib are the face of the Democrat Party, and they HATE Israel! He has never extended that label \"face of the Democrat Party\" to a white male lawmaker. When Trump does set his Twitter sights on an opponent, the nature of the attacks can vary sharply depending on who the critic is. Trump has tweeted about Schiff 41 times, with many of those mentions coming in the past three weeks as the impeachment inquiry has gotten underway. The president has accused Schiff of committing treason and being a fraud. But Trump's tweets about Schiff have focused on his actions as the chair of a committee probing the president. In contrast, Trump's tweets about Cummings \u2014 who is chair of the House Committee on Oversight and Reform \u2014 focused on the mostly black district that he represents in and around Baltimore. Trump called the area \"rat and rodent infested.\" Loading... Trump launched similar attacks against districts represented by Pelosi and Rep. John Lewis in the past. Paris Dennard is a prominent African American conservative who backs Trump. He argued that it's not race or gender that motivates the president, but the prominence of the critic. \"If you are a worthy opponent, meaning you have a large social media following ... meaning you can attract a lot of people to whatever it is you're talking about ... he's going to engage with them because he thinks it's worth the fight,\" Dennard said.",

Updated at 2 p.m. ET For the fourth year in a row, the Southern Poverty Law Center, a civil rights organization that tracks hate groups, reports that hate and domestic extremism  are rising in an unabated trend. The center found a 30 percent increase in U.S. hate groups over the past four years and a 7 percent increase in hate groups in 2018 alone, according to the center's annual \"Year in Hate and Extremism\" report.  The group designated 1,020 organizations as hate groups in 2018, a high of at least 20 years. The watchdog group blames President Trump, his administration, right-wing media outlets and the ease of spreading hate on social media platforms for the alarming increase. The growth, it says, is largely driven by \"hysteria over losing a white-majority nation to demographic change.\" \"The numbers tell a striking story \u2014 that this president is not simply a polarizing figure but a radicalizing one,\" Heidi Beirich, director of the SPLC's Intelligence Project, said in a statement. \"Rather than trying to tamp down hate, as presidents of both parties have done, President Trump elevates it \u2014 with both his rhetoric and his policies. In doing so, he's given people across America the go-ahead to to act on their worst instincts.\" The Southern Poverty Law Center is a revered civil rights watchdog group that has been around since 1971. It is credited with dealing the final blows to the Ku Klux Klan through legal battles. But in the Trump era, it has been accused of blurring the line between watchdog and activist. Critics accuse the group of overblowing the threat of hate and including groups and individuals on its lists who might not belong, from anti-immigrant groups to exclusionary religious organizations. In 2018, SPLC President Richard Cohen publicly apologized and the group paid out $3.4 million to British political activist Maajid Nawaz for including him on its anti-Muslim extremist list in 2016. The self-declared former Muslim extremist is often criticized for aligning himself with right-wing anti-Muslim politicians, but even his critics questioned his inclusion on the list. The center found that the majority of hate groups in the United States are driven by white supremacist ideology including neo-Nazis; the Ku Klux Klan, which is on the decline; white nationalists; racist skinheads; and neo-Confederates. But in reaction to the flourishing of white supremacists, the center says that black nationalist groups are also \"growing their ranks.\" It said the groups are often anti-Semitic, anti-LGBT and anti-white but, unlike white nationalist groups, have little support and basically no sway in politics. The SPLC defines a hate group as an organization that \"based on its official statements or principles, the statements of its leaders, or its activities \u2014 has beliefs or practices that attack or malign an entire class of people typically for their race, religion, ethnicity, sexual orientation or gender identity.\" The center's report tracks with the steady rise in hate crimes documented by the FBI from 2015 to 2017. It reported a 17 percent jump in hate crimes in 2017, with a particular increase in anti-Semitic hate crimes. But that list isn't complete because local law enforcement agencies report hate crimes to the FBI on a voluntary basis. The report found that although white supremacists are emboldened under the Trump administration and driven by the fear of the United States' changing demographics \u2014 by 2044 the U.S. is expected to be majority minority \u2014 and by xenophobia, the groups are beginning to lose faith in the president. It quotes the now infamous white nationalist leader Richard Spencer as evidence. Spencer led a group of white supremacists in Nazi salutes and chants of \"Hail Trump\" after the 2016 election. But in 2018, following the midterms, he said, \"The Trump moment is over, and it's time for us to move on.\" Three groups are suing the Southern Poverty Lawsuit Center over their inclusion on the hate groups list. Among those suing is the Center for Immigration Studies, a conservative think tank that is widely seen as anti-immigration. \"We stand by our hate group listings,\" said Heidi Beirich said in a press call. \"I would suggest that people take a look at our extremist files ... The Center for Immigration Studies, the group has a history of making racially inflammatory statements associating with white nationalists and circulating the work of racist writers.\"",

In 2012, as a new mom, Maranda Dynda heard a story from her midwife that she couldn't get out of her head. The midwife told her that years earlier, something bad had happened after she vaccinated her son. One minute he was fine, and the next, he was autistic. It was like \"the light had left his eyes,\" Maranda recalled her saying. The midwife implored Maranda to go online and do her own research. So she did. She started on Google. It led her to Facebook groups, where other moms echoed what the midwife had said.\"And they were just practically bombarding me with information,\" says Maranda. \"Telling me, 'Your midwife's right. This is why I don't vaccinate. This is what happened to my child who I did vaccinate versus my child who I didn't vaccinate.' Things like that.\" Maranda trusted them. She says it wasn't long before she had decided she wasn't going to vaccinate her child, either. Eventually, she did more research and realized that the purported link between vaccines and autism wasn't real. She changed her mind, and vaccinated her daughter. But looking back, she can't believe how easy it was to embrace beliefs that were false.\"It is so, so easy to Google 'What if this happens' and find something that's probably not true,\" Maranda says. \"Don't do that.\" This week on Hidden Brain, we look at how we rely on the people we trust to shape our beliefs, and why facts aren't always enough to change our minds.

In 2012, as a new mom, Maranda Dynda heard a story from her midwife that she couldn't get out of her head. The midwife told her that years earlier, something bad had happened after she vaccinated her son. One minute he was fine, and the next, he was autistic. It was like \"the light had left his eyes,\" Maranda recalled her saying. The midwife implored Maranda to go online and do her own research. So she did. She started on Google. It led her to Facebook groups, where other moms echoed what the midwife had said.\"And they were just practically bombarding me with information,\" says Maranda. \"Telling me, 'Your midwife's right. This is why I don't vaccinate. This is what happened to my child who I did vaccinate versus my child who I didn't vaccinate.' Things like that.\" Maranda trusted them. She says it wasn't long before she had decided she wasn't going to vaccinate her child, either. Eventually, she did more research and realized that the purported link between vaccines and autism wasn't real. She changed her mind, and vaccinated her daughter. But looking back, she can't believe how easy it was to embrace beliefs that were false.\"It is so, so easy to Google 'What if this happens' and find something that's probably not true,\" Maranda says. \"Don't do that.\" This week on Hidden Brain, we look at how we rely on people we trust to shape our beliefs, and why emotion can be more powerful than facts.

            "article_content": "In 1847, a Hungarian doctor named Ignaz Semmelweis tried to introduce a radical practice at his obstetrical ward in Vienna. He wanted physicians to wash their hands before treating patients. It didn't go well. Other doctors resisted the idea that their hands were dirty. They shrugged off evidence that hand washing had reduced the death rate in the clinic. Looking at their actions today, it can be hard to understand why these physicians would dismiss information that could have saved lives. But researchers who study the history of science say the spread of new innovations isn't always rational or linear. That's especially true when a new idea comes up against widely-held scientific beliefs. \"We don't like to have beliefs that are different from the people around us,\" says philosopher of science Cailin O'Connor. \"We don't like our actions to not conform with the people who we know and love.\" This week on Hidden Brain, we explore how information and misinformation spread in the world of science, and why evidence is often not enough to convince others of the truth.

            "article_content": "Democratic Reps. Ilhan Omar of Minnesota (from left), Ayanna Pressley of Massachusetts, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York and Rashida Tlaib of Michigan respond to racist remarks directed at them by President Trump at a news conference on Monday.\n                \n                    \n                    J. Scott Applewhite/AP\n                    \n                \nhide caption Democratic Reps. Ilhan Omar of Minnesota (from left), Ayanna Pressley of Massachusetts, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York and Rashida Tlaib of Michigan respond to racist remarks directed at them by President Trump at a news conference on Monday. Updated at 7 p.m. ET A group of four women lawmakers responded to attacks by President Trump with a news conference of their own on Monday evening. Earlier in the day, Trump said the members of Congress are \"free to leave\" the country if they are unhappy with the U.S. and accused them of hating America. Trump's remarks, made at an impromptu news conference in front of the White House, follow racist tweets that he sent on Sunday directed at Democratic freshmen Reps. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York, Ilhan Omar of Minnesota, Rashida Tlaib of Michigan and Ayanna Pressley of Massachusetts \u2014 all women of color. Trump tweeted that they should \"go back\" to the \"places from which they came.\" (Omar was born in Somalia; the other three were all born in the United States.) Democrats were quick to denounce the tweets on Sunday, but Republicans were largely silent until Monday. Criticism grew as the president doubled down. Asked Monday if he was concerned that \"people saw the tweet as racist and that white nationalist groups are finding common cause with you on that point,\" Trump replied, \"It doesn't concern me because many people agree with me.\" Ocasio-Cortez said at the lawmakers' news conference, \"We don't leave the things that we love, and when we love this country, what that means is that we propose the solutions to fix it.\" She added that Trump \"does not know how to defend his policies, so what he does is attack us personally, and that is what this is all about.\" The lawmakers pointed to the administration's immigration policies in particular. Ocasio-Cortez was among those who recently visited a detention facility on the U.S.-Mexico border and testified about the harsh conditions she witnessed. Pointing to past comments Trump has made about women, African American athletes and neo-Nazi protesters in Charlottesville, Va., Omar said Trump was advocating \"the agenda of white nationalists.\" \"It's time for us to impeach this president,\" she said. Tlaib echoed her call for impeachment. Earlier in the day, Trump said in a tweet that the lawmakers should apologize \"to our Country, the people of Israel and even to the Office of the President.\" When will the Radical Left Congresswomen apologize to our Country, the people of Israel and even to the Office of the President, for the foul language they have used, and the terrible things they have said. So many people are angry at them & their horrible & disgusting actions! Trump said \"the Radical Left Congresswomen\" should apologize for \"the foul language they have used, and the terrible things they have said. So many people are angry at them & their horrible & disgusting actions!\" Omar, whom Trump called out by name on Monday, tweeted, \"They are working to silence the voices of the people who see themselves represented in me. I will stay in the ring, fighting for what is right and will never back down in the face of these attacks.\" It\u2019s important to note that the President\u2019s words yday, telling four American Congresswomen of color \u201cgo back to your own country,\u201d is hallmark language of white supremacists.Trump feels comfortable leading the GOP into outright racism, and that should concern all Americans. Democrats have widely criticized the president's Sunday tweets. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, who has been at odds with the four members of her caucus, came to their defense Sunday. She tweeted that when Trump \"tells four American Congresswomen to go back to their countries, he reaffirms his plan to 'Make America Great Again' has always been about making America white again.\" Pelosi added, \"Our diversity is our strength and our unity is our power.\" In his brief comments to reporters at the White House, Trump denied that his tweets were racist. \"Not at all,\" he said. Instead, Trump claimed it was Pelosi's remarks that were racist. Pelosi announced that the House will take up a resolution \"condemning the President's xenophobic tweets\" \u2014 a resolution that she said will be sponsored by Democratic lawmakers who were born overseas. Republicans stayed mostly quiet about Trump's tweets on Sunday, but several weighed in on Monday, critical of Trump's language. In an interview on Fox & Friends on Monday morning, Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., said Trump should \"aim higher. ... They are American citizens. They won an election. Take on their policies.\" But Graham also said, \"We all know that [Ocasio-Cortez] and this crowd are a bunch of communists. They hate Israel. They hate our own country.\" Rep. Paul Mitchell, R-Mich., tweeted at Trump, \"we must be better than comments like these. I share the political frustrations with some members of the other party, but these comments are beneath leaders.\" .@RealDonaldTrump, we must be better than comments like these. I share the political frustrations with some members of the other party, but these comments are beneath leaders. https://t.co/4b8e5hlSZI Another Michigan GOP lawmaker, Rep. Fred Upton, tweeted that he is \"appalled by the President's tweets,\" adding, \"There's no excuse.\" Upton also condemned what he labeled \"Inflammatory rhetoric from both sides of the aisle that is used to divide us.\" ...that we ought to be working on together \u2013 immigration, the debt ceiling, the border crisis. The President\u2019s tweets were flat out wrong and uncalled for, and I would encourage my colleagues from both parties to stop talking so much and start governing more. Sen. Pat Toomey, R-Pa., also issued a statement condemning the tweets. \"President Trump was wrong to suggest that four left-wing congresswomen should go back to where they came from. Three of the four were born in America and the citizenship of all four is as valid as mine,\" he said. \"I couldn't disagree more with these congresswomen's views on immigration, socialism, national security, and virtually every policy issue. But they are entitled to their opinions, however misguided they may be. We should defeat their ideas on the merits, not on the basis of their ancestry.\" One of the strongest reactions among Republicans came from Rep. Will Hurd of Texas, who is the only African American Republican in the House. Hurd told CNN that the president's tweets were \"racist and xenophobic\" and said it was \"behavior that's unbecoming of the leader of the free world. He should be talking about things that unite us, not divide us.\" Alaska Sen. Lisa Murkowski tweeted, \"There is no excuse for the president's spiteful comments \u2013they were absolutely unacceptable and this needs to stop.\" And Sen. Tim Scott, R-S.C., the Senate's only African American Republican, charged that the Democratic Party was \"embroiled in racial controversy,\" while also condemning the president's \"racially offensive language.\" No matter our political disagreements, aiming for the lowest common denominator will only divide our nation further. My full statement below: pic.twitter.com/QXuV8arXso Trump, who in a separate tweet on Saturday claimed 94% support from Republican Party members, seemed to welcome the storm he set off, saying in another tweet that it was \"sad\" to see Democrats \"sticking up for people who speak so badly of our Country and who, in addition, hate Israel with a true and unbridled passion.\" Omar has faced controversy for remarks critical of Israel earlier this year that many deemed anti-Semitic. The House voted in March to condemn \"anti-Semitism, Islamophobia, racism and other forms of bigotry,\" without explicitly naming Omar. While the Anti-Defamation League was among the groups to denounce Omar's comments, on Monday the anti-hate speech organization turned its criticism on Trump. ADL CEO Jonathan Greenblatt said in a statement: \"While ADL has publicly disagreed with these congresswomen on some issues, the president is echoing the racist talking points of white nationalists and cynically using the Jewish people and the state of Israel as a shield to double down on his remarks. Politicizing the widespread, bipartisan support for Israel and throwing around accusations of anti-Semitism is damaging to the security of Israel and the Jewish community. He should lead by example, stop politicizing these issues and stop smearing members of Congress.\"",
