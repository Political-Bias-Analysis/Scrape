Exit polls show significant support from women was a key factor in Obama's victory over Romney in Nevada. In an election that highlighted the political divide over abortion, female voters turned out to be a key to victory for President Obama. Public outcry over Republican Todd Akin's comments on \"legitimate rape\" ultimately gave Democrat Claire McCaskill a U.S. Senate victory in Missouri. And in Indiana, Republican Senate hopeful Richard Mourdock lost his race at least in part because of his comments about pregnancy resulting from rape. The Republicans' comments pushed the abortion issue to the forefront \u2014 and also united and motivated abortion rights activists. \"These are issues deeply important to women,\" says Cecile Richards, president of the Planned Parenthood Federation. She says an 18-point gender gap helped Obama defeat Mitt Romney and what she calls the GOP attack on women's rights. \"They're not just social issues, as Romney tried to say. Access to affordable health care, access to family planning \u2014 these are issues that are economic issues for women and their families,\" Richards says. But the day after the election, many conservatives were pondering their losses. They say their anti-abortion principles weren't the problem \u2014 it was the Republican Party's failure to run a truly conservative candidate. And they're vowing to change the party and continue their fight to restrict abortion. In a news conference Wednesday, Richard Viguerie, chairman of ConservativeHQ.com, said Republicans don't win unless they nationalize elections around conservative values. \"Conservatives are saying never again are we going to nominate a big-government, establishment Republican for president,\" he said. Alongside Viguerie was Marjorie Dannenfelser, head of the Susan B. Anthony List, a political action committee that backs candidates opposed to abortion. \"Obama launched a war over abortion and on the life issue,\" she said. \"Therefore, he got to completely define what that issue was. And what is it? Rape.\" Dannenfelser says the Republicans left votes on the table because they failed to really take on the abortion issue and explain their position. She calls the result a kind of New Year's Day for the movement. \"If you truly believe that you are living in a great human civil rights movement, you don't give up. That is why we grow as a movement. So this is the beginning of a new cycle,\" she said. Other groups that oppose abortion say they'll continue to take their fight to the states \u2014 for example, working on a bill to allow states to opt out of paying for abortions under the federal health care law. They're also pushing for more restrictions on abortion and on the clinics where they're performed. Donna Crane with NARAL Pro-Choice America says she's not surprised. \"We take very seriously their threat that they're going to redouble their efforts at the state level,\" she says, \"and I think that is a foolish course of action in light of the really clear message they got from Americans on Tuesday night.\" But anti-abortion groups say that's not the message they got. They say the abortion issue is far from settled \u2014 that Romney never reached their core supporters.",

            "article_content": "Missouri Rep. Todd Akin, running for the U.S. Senate, continues to draw fire over his remarks last weekend suggesting that women who are \"legitimately raped\" have a secret biological method to avoid conceiving a child after a rape. Akin said: \"the female body has ways to try to shut that whole thing down.\" He's since apologized, and run several ads saying he knows women can become pregnant through rape. But he later said his mistake was actually using a single word - legitimate - to describe rape. He's been denounced by Democratic and Republican candidates, including Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney and lost key financial support, including from the National Republican Senatorial Campaign which AP reports was poised to pump $5 million dollars in advertising. But his supporters continue to back him. NPR's Steve Inskeep talked with Connie Mackey, the head of the pro-life Family Research Council's political action committee. Steve asked her if the word 'legitimate' was the only thing that Akin got wrong. \"Unfortunately no\", she said. \"The statement was wrong, plain and simple.\" Mackey says people have seen images of the horror of rape, and that's why the incident blew up so quickly. \"When you try to go into the weeds politically on this issue it's a disaster, as we just saw,\" she observed. So why support Akin? Mackey launched into a full voiced defense: because he's pro-life. Akin has won election to his congressional seat six times, understands economic issues, is a military veteran and is a \"good and decent man\". She says the rape comments were a single \"gaffe\". When Steve questioned whether Akin should have known ahead of time his remarks were incorrect, Mackey fired back, asking why the media hasn't questioned President Obama's statement that men should never legislate health issues related to women. NPR replayed the Obama statement, which actually says that politicians, some of them men, shouldn't interfere in women's health care. Asked if there's enough financial support from pro-life groups to help Akin run his campaign, Mackey ruefully said, \"no\". But she says the Family Research Council won't turn its back on him.",

The House took eight separate abortion-related votes in 2011 \u2014 the most in a decade, according to NARAL Pro-Choice America. All those votes were on bills to restrict abortion, including one that became law, reinstating a ban on the use of District of Columbia taxpayer funds for the procedure. But now abortion-rights advocates may have found something they like that may even get through Congress and to President Obama's desk. Last month, with little notice or fanfare, Sen. Jeanne Shaheen, a New Hampshire Democrat, got an amendment included in the huge annual Department of Defense bill that would permit military health insurance to cover abortions for servicewomen whose pregnancies are the result of rape or incest. Three Republican senators \u2014 John McCain of Arizona, Scott Brown from Massachusetts and Susan Collins of Maine \u2014 voted for the amendment. Shaheen, who is now fighting to keep the language in the bill, says it's a matter of simple equity. \"Federal civilian employees, Medicaid recipients, even federal prison inmates are guaranteed affordable access to abortion in cases of rape,\" she said at a news conference. \"But women in uniform are on their own.\" Shaheen is calling out the big guns, so to speak. At the news conference Thursday she was flanked by two retired military officers who are helping lobby to prevent the language from being removed from the bill. \"Women compose almost fifteen percent of our military, serving with courage and distinction in every branch of service,\" said retired Major General Dennis Laich. \"Lifting this ban is not only a matter of basic fairness; it is also a matter of ensuring military readiness.\" Major General Gale Pollock, former surgeon general for the army, agreed. \"When a servicewoman is raped, becomes pregnant, and chooses to end a pregnancy caused by an act of violence, she should not have to scramble to find the funds she needs to pay for an abortion,\" she said. But what may end up keeping the amendment is less the lobbying of retired Army brass, and more simple math. Because the amendment is currently in the bill, it will require 60 votes in the Senate to take it out. That's something opponents have conceded will be difficult, if not impossible. A majority of House members oppose abortion rights, and it's all but certain the version of the bill in that chamber won't include similar language. So the question will have to be settled when the House and Senate meet to hammer out a compromise. If the abortion language survives, even if a majority of the House disapproves, its only option will be to vote down the entire defense bill. That is traditionally a highly unlikely event. Meanwhile, anti-abortion groups have been mostly silent on the issue. While it was being debated in the Senate they were busier pushing a bill in the House to ban abortion on the basis of sex-selection. That measure failed to pass.",

On Thursday, two major anti-abortion groups endorsed Romney. A decade ago, while running for Massachusetts governor, Mitt Romney vowed to \"preserve and protect a woman's right to choose\" abortion. On Thursday, the presumptive Republican presidential nominee won the endorsement of both the oldest and largest anti-abortion group in the nation \u2014 the National Right to Life Committee \u2014 and one of the newer groups with a large wad of cash ready to spend on his behalf \u2014 the Susan B. Anthony List. National Right to Life Committee President Carol Tobias said Romney's former position supporting abortion rights doesn't bother her or her organization. \"The pro-life movement is filled with converts,\" she told reporters at a news conference. \"We love people who have changed their position. Mitt Romney admits that he has done that and we are happy to be working with him.\" The Susan B. Anthony list alone says it will spend \"$10 to $12 million in Senate and presidential battleground states mobilizing pro-life voters to ensure victory.\" Said Tobias: \"We have absolutely no question \u2014 no doubt about his pro-life convictions \u2014 and we will be happy to support him as a pro-life president.\" Why, then, did the group wait until after Romney's nomination was basically a foregone conclusion to make its endorsement? Because, said Tobias, \"every candidate who has run for the Republican nomination for president took a pro-life position and kept the life issues at the forefront of this race.\" In fact, the national group publicly reprimanded a state affiliate, Georgia Right to Life, when it endorsed former House Speaker Newt Gingrich and former Pennsylvania Sen. Rick Santorum, who ended his campaign this week. This year is markedly different from 2008, when National Right to Life got in early \u2014 too early, perhaps. It endorsed former Sen. Fred Thompson of Tennessee, whose campaign fizzled fast. \"In 2008, there was a pro-abortion candidate in the GOP primary,\" Tobias said, referring to former New York Mayor Rudolph Giuliani. \"And we wanted to make sure that he did not get the nomination. So we wanted to select a pro-life candidate to support\" from the start. What is clear this time is that the group's top priority is less the election of Romney than the defeat of President Obama. Indeed, much of the news conference consisted not of singing Romney's praises but of chronicling Obama's positions. \"On his second day in office, Jan. 22, 2009, President Obama issued a statement reaffirming his commitment to defend Roe v. Wade, which gave us abortion on demand,\" said Tobias. Then, she said, there's his position on stem-cell research. \"President Obama authorizes taxpayer funding of research that requires killing human embryos,\" she said. And it's not just abortion. Raimundo Rojas, the group's director of Hispanic outreach, emphasized the group's long-standing position that the 2010 national health law could lead to the rationing of health care. He aimed his comments squarely at Hispanic immigrants, a key voting bloc. \"What they don't understand is why is it in this country their daughter is being denied treatment by a junta of bureaucrats,\" he said, after delivering much of his statement in Spanish. \"And that's the looming tragic reality\" of President Obama's health care law. The Romney endorsements did not go unnoticed by the leading abortion-rights groups, who have long since written him off as a potential ally. \"So much for the idea that Romney will try to move to the middle in the general election,\" said Nancy Keenan of NARAL Pro-Choice America, in a statement about the Susan B. Anthony List endorsement. \"One of the major groups behind the War on Women is now rewarding Romney for supporting policies that would undermine women's freedom and privacy at every turn.\" The advocacy arm of Planned Parenthood, for its part, released a video suggesting that when it comes to women's health, Romney's positions are the same as Santorum's.",

Those in favor of fewer regulations argue it's a matter of free speech, one that requires funding to be heard. They consider limiting spending a way of also controlling speech.

GOP presidential candidate Mitt Romney will spend the next seven months convincing us to send him to the White House. To get there, he'll have to make a strong case to one very important voting bloc: women. A poll out this week by ABC and the Washington Post shows President Obama with a 19-point lead over Romney with women voters. For Romney to win, he's got to make a significant dent in that margin. In 2008, there were 10 million more women voters than men. Those voters backed President Obama over Republican John McCain by a 13-point margin. So this election season, what does the GOP need to do in order to win back women voters? A Perception Problem This week, NPR asked women in Jackson, Miss., \u2014 older women, younger women, single and married \u2014 about who they plan to vote for in November and which party best represents the interests of women. \"Probably the Democrats,\" says Debbie Rankin, a Republican who's supporting Mitt Romney. \"They're much more liberal, and it is what it is.\" Independent Holly Smith, who is backing Barack Obama, says she doesn't really like the way the Republican Party is handling women's issues. \"With the personhood stuff and abortions back on the table ... I feel like we're past that,\" Smith says. \"I feel like they're focusing on the wrong things and it's really turning me off.\" That Republican perception problem is something many GOP leaders are trying to fight. Wyoming Rep. Cynthia Lummis, a Republican and co-chair of the Congressional Caucus for Women's Issues, tells weekends on All Things Considered host Guy Raz that she is very concerned, and that there are things more important than contraception issues this election. \"[It] has no place in the 2012 presidential debate when we are ... trillions in debt,\" Lummis says. \"To make issues like contraception dominate news and people's attention really detracts from the real issues in this campaign, and I think really do hurt Republican candidates.\" The focus for Mitt Romney, Lummis says, should be on debt, the deficit, jobs and the economy. She says he especially needs to target independent women in swing states, where President Obama's campaign is also focusing attention. Winning 'Wal-Mart Women' Ever since the 1992 presidential election, more women have voted for the Democrat than the Republican presidential candidate. GOP strategists believe the key to winning is to narrow the gap. According to Republican strategist Linda DiVall, the group that could most help Mitt Romney is one she calls \"Wal-Mart women.\" This would be women with a high school diploma and a household income under $50,000. DiVall's research has shown that these women are most likely to focus on jobs and gas prices. She tells NPR's Raz that they have probably made some significant sacrifices over the past few years, shop at bargain stores, clip coupons and do whatever they can to stay afloat and take care of their families. \"I do believe that Gov. Romney can be competitive with that group and has a very strong opportunity to appeal to them,\" DiVall says. \"The question for them is: Do you want to continue along this path, or do you think you can do better by making a change for president?\" Though the Republican Party believes in a limited role for government, she says the position many male Republican politicians take on contraception issues and abortion runs counter to that, and could create a problem for them this election season. \"They appear to want to dictate what a woman should do with her life,\" she says. \"I think the Republicans ... [have] probably received a rather significant wake-up call to be a little bit more careful with their words. Again, the overwhelming focus is on the economy and getting America moving back in the right direction.\" Improving The Message For Black Women At both party conventions this summer, expect to see a lot of women front and center. This includes Florida's Lt. Gov. Jennifer Carroll, the first African-American elected to statewide office there. So why are black women like Carroll still so rare in the Republican Party? Carroll isn't sure. If you talk to African-American families, she says, they tend to think conservatively. \"From religious values and moral compass and economics and education, they fall right in line with conservative principals,\" she says. Those issues can get lost on the political stage, however. \"I think we get so much into the partisanship and the divide and the demonizing of character ... that we go away from really understanding the policies and the issues and we go off course, which is unfortunate,\" Carroll tells NPR's Raz. In order to do better among black women voters, Carroll says Republicans need to improve their message and tell them how GOP policies have benefited women and created more opportunities for equality.",

Beginning in 2013, girls between the ages of 15 and 18 will be able to get birth control free of charge, and without parental notification. Beginning next year, young women in France between the ages of 15 and 18 will have access to birth control free of charge, and without parental notification. The French government says the new measure is intended to reduce pregnancies in this age group that result from a mixture of ignorance, taboo and lack of access to contraception. One place where information is available on birth control, abortion and sexual abuse is a family planning clinic in a gritty neighborhood in the east of Paris. On a recent day, a counselor talks with a handful of teenage girls in a sitting room. Clinic director Isabelle Louis says the young women who come to the clinic aren't necessarily poor; she says many hail from well-off families and live on the other side of Paris. \"It's not very easy for young women to go to see her family doctor and ask for contraception,\" Louis says. \"A lot of them are afraid the doctor would tell the parents she came.\" Starting in January, a law will protect these girls' anonymity at their family doctor's office, and the state will pick up the cost of the consultation and contraception. Under current rules, teenagers wanting absolute anonymity with a doctor have to pay for the visit in cash without submitting a claim to get the money back. And birth control is only partially reimbursed by the French state. Only clinics like this one are free. The new law will also protect girls' anonymity at their family doctor's office. Under current rules, teenagers wanting absolute anonymity with a doctor have to pay for the visit in cash without submitting a claim to get reimbursed.\n                \n                    \n                    Eleanor Beardsley/NPR\n                    \n                \nhide caption The new law will also protect girls' anonymity at their family doctor's office. Under current rules, teenagers wanting absolute anonymity with a doctor have to pay for the visit in cash without submitting a claim to get reimbursed. French health officials say the new measure will help protect teenagers who are from low-income families, and from families where sexuality is a taboo subject. Widespread Support For The Plan Marie, a 17-year-old who doesn't want to give her last name, is visiting the clinic for the first time. She says she didn't know about the new law but thinks it's a good idea, and probably will see her family doctor next time \u2014 because she knows him and trusts him more, she says. Marie is in her senior year at a very competitive Paris high school and says she cannot risk getting pregnant. But she comes from a very Catholic family, and says her parents wouldn't approve of her sexual activity. \"They don't want me to have sex with a lot of guys, because they think sex means love, too. So they want me to have a sexual activity with feelings,\" she says. She says she actually feels the same. \"I do have sexual activity with my boyfriend because I love him,\" Marie says. \"Yeah, I feel the same [as my parents].\" While birth control generated a vitriolic debate in the U.S. election campaign this year, the French government adopted the measure without a battle of any kind. One Catholic organization did oppose it. CLER is a group that counsels young people about sexuality and relationships. A video on their website shows volunteers going into schools to talk to adolescents. \"We think reimbursing for contraception is a hygienist approach to sexuality, like the only thing that matters is health,\" says Jean Eude Tisson, president of CLER. \"We think it goes beyond that.\" Tisson says his group tries to explain that marriage brings the body and spirit together. He says the French government would do better to spend the money on more effective sex education in schools rather than on contraception. Back at the clinic, 17-year-old Sabrina looks a bit nervous in the sitting room. It's her first time, too. But she didn't come for birth control. \"My father wants me to do a virginity test and get a virginity certificate. He says if I'm not a virgin he's gonna send me back to Morocco,\" she says. Sabrina says she has not had sexual relations yet, but she doesn't think she'll wait until marriage either \u2014 despite her father's threat. Counselors at the clinic say the new law may not solve every problem, but by giving young women like Sabrina other options for anonymous information, advice and free care, they believe it's a step in the right direction.",

Dozens of medical, women's health and reproductive health groups marked the first anniversary of Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius' decision to maintain age restrictions on the sale of the morning-after birth control pill without a prescription by urging her to reconsider that decision. \"The unique dual-labeling of Plan B One Step has led to confusion among consumers and health care professionals alike, particularly regarding age restrictions and whether men and women can purchase non-prescription emergency contraception,\" said a letter signed by more than three dozen women's health, reproductive rights and individual providers of health care. \"A recent Boston University study of 943 pharmacies in five major cities revealed that, when called posed as 17 year olds seeking EC, one in five were told they could not purchase EC under any circumstances,\" the letter said. In fact, those 17 and older are eligible to purchase the product without a prescription; those 16 and younger may purchase it with a health provider's written order. A second letter urging the secretary to reverse her 2011 ruling came from 13 medical associations, including the American Congress of Obstetricians and Gynecologists and American Academy of Pediatrics, both of which recently spoke out on the issue, but also more mainstream groups like the American Academy of Family Physicians and the American Medical Association. \"Studies have shown teen and adult women can read and follow instructions for safe and proper use of emergency contraception,\" the medical groups' letter said. \"Plan B is extremely safe for teenagers to use; moreover, there is no evidence that ready access to Plan B encourages risky behaviors among teens.\" But the desire to have the decision overturned is hardly unanimous. Speaking in particular of the obstetrician-gynecologist and pediatrician groups, who have been most vocal recently. \"Sadly, both those organizations ... are now being run by activists rather than people who have the first concern of the patients in mind,\" said Wendy Wright of the Catholic Family and Human Rights Institute. The Obama administration hasn't said whether or not it intends to revisit last year's controversial ruling.",

Friday marks a not-so-happy anniversary for some of President Obama's biggest supporters: It's exactly one year since Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius decided not to lift the age restrictions on availability of the so-called morning-after pill, Plan B. But now, with the election safely behind them, backers of the pill are hoping the administration may be willing to revisit the issue. \"We are asking Secretary Sebelius to go back and take another look at the science, the medical evidence ... and see if there's a way to come to agreement to make this product more easily available to the women who need it,\" says Kirsten Moore, president and CEO of the Reproductive Health Technologies Project. Moore points out that during the past year, the American Congress of Obstetricians and Gynecologists has recommended that all birth control pills be sold over the counter, while the American Academy of Pediatrics has recommended routine advance prescription of the morning-after pill to teen girls. Over-The-Counter Access Since 2009, emergency contraceptives have been available under what's known as a split label. That means those ages 16 and under need a prescription for the product, which is really just a high dose of regular birth control pills. It is not the same as the abortion pill, RU-486. But the split label also means that even those old enough to buy the product without a prescription must ask a pharmacist for it \u2014 and show ID. Moore says that's not the ideal situation for a product that works best when taken as soon as possible: Plan B is most effective if taken within 24 hours of unprotected intercourse. \"Having Plan B on the shelf between condoms and pregnancy test kits is where it belongs, not behind the counter,\" she says. Plus, when it's behind the counter, it's not just younger women who may have trouble getting it. Last year, Oklahoma law student Hilary McKinney went to a nearby Target with her fiance after his condom broke. She sent him to the pharmacy counter to pick it up. But the pharmacist wouldn't sell it to him. McKinney returned to the counter and confronted the pharmacist, she says, \"and she looked at me and said, 'I can't sell it to men. Who knows what they could be doing with it?' \" For the record, Plan B is supposed to be available to anyone 17 or older without a prescription, male or female. (The FDA originally approved the drug without prescription for those ages 18 and over in 2006; it lowered the age to 17 after a judge's order three years later.) McKinney, who now practices family law in Tulsa, says her experience is an example of why she thinks the product ought to be much more easily available. \"We never invited this pharmacist into making our reproductive choices with us,\" she says. \"And she shouldn't have intervened in what is a legal, safe, effective way of preventing a pregnancy, which is what we were trying to do.\" Last December, with a Democratic administration, Plan B advocates were sure the age restriction would be lifted. And that's what FDA commissioner Margaret Hamburg recommended. But she was overruled by Sebelius, who said she was worried about use by the youngest teenagers. However, many people assumed the decision was a political one. Catholics were already up in arms about contraceptives being required under the federal health law, and it was thought that the administration didn't want to add any more fuel to the fire with the election approaching. A New Political Climate? Now, however, things are different, Moore says. \"The voters said very clearly this past November that when it comes to women's health, they think that prevention is a good thing; providing contraception is a good thing; reducing barriers to access, whether it be cost, is a good thing,\" she says. \"And they supported a candidate who clearly made that a part of his message.\" Moreover, Moore says, she thinks the election shows that there would be no political price to be paid by the administration for making what advocates say is the science-based decision. \"If there was concern that doing the right thing by emergency contraception was going to get people into trouble,\" she says, \"I think that question's been asked and answered politically.\" That is not to suggest that the political opposition to making Plan B more widely available has disappeared. \"The reality is if it's easier to obtain, then it becomes not 'Plan B' but 'Plan A,' \" says Wendy Wright, a vice president at the Catholic Family and Human Rights Institute. \"It becomes the choice of first resort rather than last resort.\" Wright also says younger girls are more at risk of being abused and need the contact with a medical professional ensured by requiring a prescription. \"If young girls are sexually active, they're very likely the victims of sexual abuse, and a medical exam provides the opportunity for someone to intervene to rescue a girl who is being sexually abused,\" Wright says. \"And so it really is in the best interest of girls, having the morning-after pill only through prescription to ensure that not only are her medical needs being met, but also to ensure that she's not being abused.\" The Obama administration, meanwhile, had no comment as to whether it plans to revisit its decision to keep the current age restrictions in place.",

NPR.org's Scott Neuman wrote earlier about how \"a mixture of demographics, superior organization and a few tactical missteps from Republicans\" helped President Obama win the battleground states. From this morning's post-election analyses of the presidential campaign, here are three more looks at why Obama was re-elected Tuesday: -- The New York Times: \"In Chicago, the [Obama] campaign recruited a team of behavioral scientists to build an extraordinarily sophisticated database packed with names of millions of undecided voters and potential supporters. The ever-expanding list let the campaign find and register new voters who fit the demographic pattern of Obama backers and methodically track their views through thousands of telephone calls every night. \"That allowed the Obama campaign not only to alter the very nature of the electorate, making it younger and less white, but also to create a portrait of shifting voter allegiances. The power of this operation stunned Mr. Romney's aides on election night, as they saw voters they never even knew existed turn out in places like Osceola County, Fla.\" -- Los Angeles Times: \"The president built his winning coalition on a series of election-year initiatives and issue differences with Republican challenger Mitt Romney. In the months leading up to the election, Obama announced his support for same-sex marriage, unilaterally granted a form of limited legalization to young illegal immigrants and put abortion rights and contraception at the heart of a brutally effective anti-Romney attack ad campaign. \"The result turned out to be an unbeatable combination: virtually universal support from black voters, who turned out as strongly as in 2008, plus decisive backing from members of the younger and fast-growing Latino and Asian American communities, who chose Obama over Romney by ratios of roughly 3 to 1. All of those groups contributed to Obama's majority among women. (Gay voters, a far smaller group, went for Obama by a 54-point margin.)\" -- The Wall Street Journal: \"Mitt Romney is one of the wealthiest men ever to run for president. And yet the lack of money earlier this year stalled his campaign, and he never really recovered. ... \"Back in spring, the Romney campaign's biggest worry was money. So the campaign's finance chair, Spencer Zwick, huddled with political director Rich Beeson to craft a complex schedule that took Mr. Romney to the cities that were prime real estate for fundraising. It meant visits to places like California, Texas and New York\u2014none of which were important political battlegrounds. ... \"But Mr. Romney paid a deep political price. The fundraising marathon reduced his ability to deliver his own message to voters just as the Obama campaign was stepping in to define the Republican candidate on its terms.\" There's still time to answer our question: \"What clinched the election for President Obama?\"",

Tuesday's plans call for some TV and radio interviews and maybe a game of basketball with some friends.  SCOTT HORSLEY, BYLINE: And I'm Scott Horsley, traveling with the Obama campaign. Actually, the president's campaign travel is finished. Mr. Obama spent the night at his own home in Chicago. Today's plans call for some TV and radio interviews and maybe a game of basketball with some friends. Mr. Obama's last reelection rally came last night in Iowa, where 20,000 people gathered just outside the caucus headquarters where he launched his first presidential campaign more than five years ago. (SOUNDBITE OF SPEECH) PRESIDENT BARACK OBAMA: This is where some of the first young people who joined our campaign set up shop, willing to work for little pay and less sleep because they believed that people who love their country can change it. (SOUNDBITE OF SONG, \"LAND OF HOPE AND DREAMS\") BRUCE SPRINGSTEEN: (Singing) Meet me in a land of hope and dreams. HORSLEY: Mr. Obama was joined at rallies throughout the Midwest yesterday by Bruce Springsteen, whose anthem \"We Take Care of Our Own\" provided the theme song for this year's campaign. Springsteen, who also performed for Mr. Obama in 2008, told supporters it's up to them to keep the hopes of that campaign alive, despite the fierce challenges of the last four years. (SOUNDBITE OF SPEECH) SPRINGSTEEN: I've lived long enough to know that the future is rarely a time rushing in. It's often a slow march, inch by inch, day after long day. HORSLEY: This campaign has also been waged inch by inch. The president and his advisors have always known they face a tougher contest than they did four years ago. They've relied on a huge network of volunteers to go block by block, signing up new voters and persuading supporters to get to the polls. OBAMA: Jim, this is Barack Obama. It really is. HORSLEY: Last night, Mr. Obama dropped by the German Village campaign office in Columbus, Ohio to cheer on those volunteers in person and by telephone. OBAMA: Well, listen, I heard all the doors you've been knocking on and all the work you've been doing and canvassing, and I just wanted to say thank you. HORSLEY: The Obama team believes they come into Election Day with a small, but persistent polling advantage in Ohio and other critical states, as well as a head start, thanks to early voting. Political advisor David Axelrod scoffs at Republican claims of a late-breaking wave for Governor Romney. DAVID AXELROD: Our views are based on cold-hard data. Theirs is based on this kind of mystical faith that there's this hidden vote that's going to come roaring out on Election Day, and in most cases overcome a disadvantage that they have from early vote. I can tell you we are utterly confident that we're going to win this race, and they'll be left to explain why the mythical wave never came. HORSLEY: Campaign aides are quick to add they're taking nothing for granted, and they promise a robust effort to get out the vote today. But, speaking to supporters in Cincinnati over the weekend, Mr. Obama allowed himself to look beyond Election Day, to what might happen if he's given a second term. (SOUNDBITE OF SPEECH) OBAMA: I intend to win Ohio, and I intend to win the presidency one more time. But even after that, I'm going to need all of you involved to make sure that we don't let up. HORSLEY: If he does win, Mr. Obama hopes the election results might persuade Congressional Republicans to come to the bargaining table on issues such as tax policy and immigration. He said he's willing to negotiate with lawmakers from both parties, but he's also vowed not to trade away core Democratic priorities, such as the new health care law, Medicaid and funding for family planning. (SOUNDBITE OF SPEECH) OBAMA: That's not bipartisanship. That's not change. That's surrender. That's surrender to the same status quo that's been squeezing middle-class families for way too long. (SOUNDBITE OF SONG, \"DREAM BABY DREAM\") SPRINGSTEEN: (Singing) Oh, we dream, baby, now, surrender(ph). HORSLEY: In order to make that stand with Congressional Republicans, though, Mr. Obama first has to win today. Scott Horsley, NPR News, Des Moines.

            "article_content": "As the election season ends, so does the ad season. With close to a billion dollars spent on presidential TV ads and more than a million spots, do any ads stand out as memorable? Well, they certainly don't do what \"Morning in America\" did for Ronald Reagan. So while negative ads may be effective \u2014 and therefore plentiful \u2014 they're unlikely to stick in the mind.  ROBERT SIEGEL, HOST: Forty-five thousand ads against Sherrod Brown alone, and it's not just Ohio. Across the country, Americans suffered through more than 1 million presidential TV spots, most of them remarkably negative. And so TV lovers take heart, the end is near. But first, a quick look back. As NPR's Brian Naylor reports, this election cycle may have been big on quantity, but election experts say it was woefully short on quality. BRIAN NAYLOR, BYLINE: Just think. If you're lucky to live in a state like Iowa or New Hampshire, one with an early caucus or primary, you've been watching presidential campaign TV ads for more than a year. The campaigns and outside groups have spent, according to NPR's tally, $936 million on TV ads. What do they get for their money? John Geer, a political scientist at Vanderbilt University in Nashville, was not impressed. JOHN GEER: I think in general, the ads were what I would term uninspired. They seemed to be rushed. They're just trying to respond to the message of the day rather than trying to speak to an overall theme. And I think that's a big problem. SONARI GLINTON, BYLINE: Vanderbilt had an online ad rating project. Geer said one spot, which voters found memorable, was an Obama campaign ad which attacked Mitt Romney. It featured footage of Romney singing \"America the Beautiful\" at a campaign rally. (SOUNDBITE OF POLITICAL AD) NAYLOR: The graphics charge Romney with outsourcing jobs to Mexico and China and having, quote, \"millions in Swiss bank accounts.\" One notable feature of this year's campaign was the amount of spending by outside groups on the presidential election. American Crossroads and its affiliate, Crossroads GPS, founded by Republican strategist Karl Rove, spent nearly $170 million on ads attacking the president, like this one. (SOUNDBITE OF POLITICAL AD) NAYLOR: This ad also fit into both campaigns theme of a war on women. The Obama campaign used ads attacking Romney's stance on abortion and contraception, while Republicans focused on how the poor economy hit women especially hard. Victoria DeFrancesco Soto, a fellow at the University of Texas, says the Crossroads ad is a twofer. DR. VICTORIA DEFRANCESCO SOTO: It highlights the groups that were most affected by the recession who also happen to be the staunchest supporters of President Obama, so African-American women and Latinas. So they're saying to these groups of women, they're saying: Hey, you had it the worst. Give us a try. We can help you out. NAYLOR: The onslaught of spots featuring scary music and unflattering pictures of the candidates does not impress advertising professionals. Claudia Caplan is with the RP3 Agency based in Bethesda, Maryland. Caplan's agency does not do political ads, and she's not much impressed with the spots she's seen. CLAUDIA CAPLAN: They certainly aren't artful. One of the things that we all think back on is the Reagan \"Morning in America\" spot and that that really didn't necessarily feature President Reagan. It featured ideas and thoughts about this country, and it was quite beautiful. And it really used all the best principles of consumer advertising. I honestly don't think we've seen anything like that since. (SOUNDBITE OF \"MORNING IN AMERICA\" POLITICAL AD) NAYLOR: Caplan says that spot, which ran some 28 years ago, is still remembered because of the emotional chords it struck. But this year, campaigns were much more interested in, as John Geer puts it, carpet-bombing viewers with ads rather than appealing to emotions other than fear. Brian Naylor, NPR News, Washington.

Abortion isn't usually a major issue in presidential campaigns. But this year is different. Both President Obama and former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney are putting the issue front and center, including official campaign-produced ads. A TV spot from the Romney campaign shows the candidate's abortion stance in a different light. That's a big change from many of the previous presidential races, where the campaigns normally let surrogates do the talking about one of the most contentious issues in politics. An advertisement from the Obama campaign zeroes in on Mr. Romney's position on abortion. That's because in both cases candidates wanted to secure their base voters \u2014 those who support abortion rights in the case of Democrats and those who oppose them for Republicans \u2014 without antagonizing the minorities in each party who hold the other view. This fall, however, GOP challenger Romney has been walking an interesting tightrope \u2014 appearing to moderate his position on the one hand, while maintaining a strict anti-abortion stance on the other. Perhaps even more curious is the fact that those very ardent anti-abortion Republicans \u2014 some of the same ones who worried that Romney might be too moderate on abortion during the primaries \u2014 don't seem to be that worried right now. \"I'm confident that the Romney administration is going to stand for the principles of protecting life, of protecting conscience that have been the mainstay of what their campaign has been saying all along,\" said Anna Franzonello, staff counsel for Americans United for Life. Yet they seem to have been ignoring the fact that some of his surrogates have been trying to convince more moderate voters that Romney really wouldn't be such a threat to abortion rights. During the Republican National Convention in September, Romney's sister Jane told a reporter that a ban on abortion is \"never going to happen\" with her brother in the White House. And just last week, former Sen. Norm Coleman, R-Minn., told a group of Jewish voters in Ohio that they should not fear an overturn of Roe v. Wade, the landmark Supreme Court decision, should Romney become president. \"President Bush ... had two Supreme Court picks, [and] Roe v. Wade wasn't reversed,\" Coleman said. So what explains all this? Ed Kilgore thinks he knows. Kilgore is a senior fellow at the Democratic centrist think tank the Progressive Policy Institute and author of the Washington Monthly's Political Animal blog. He says that, Coleman's claim notwithstanding, anti-abortion forces know they are now within striking distance of achieving that ultimate goal \u2014 overturning Roe. \"According to just about every court watcher, thanks to two appointments to the court by George W. Bush, there are almost certainly four justices on the court right now that are prepared to either reverse or significantly modify Roe,\" Kilgore said. And with four justices older than 70, it's considered highly likely that the next president will have at least one chance to appoint that pivotal fifth vote. But Kilgore says there's another reason reproductive rights are so front and center this year. Republicans actually brought up the issue first. \"Republicans decided near the end of the primary season, actually, that they had a big opening to go after the Catholic vote based on the administration's contraception coverage mandate \u2014 which Republicans and some cultural conservatives treated as an invitation to mandatory coverage of abortion pills,\" he said. Republicans also went strongly after funding for Planned Parenthood, something Franzonello of Americans United for Life defends. \"They're trying to paint Mitt Romney as being the one who's so extreme when he says, 'We're going to cut federal funding to Planned Parenthood,' \" she said. \"What we've seen from the Obama administration is the extreme on the other end, too \u2014 that where states have wanted to cut their ties with the abortion industry, the Obama administration has injected itself and said, 'No, you can't do that.' \" The administration has, in fact, moved to block both Texas and Indiana from cutting off funds to Planned Parenthood, citing federal law that requires that women be allowed to choose their own providers of family planning and other federally covered services. But Kilgore says that while in previous campaigns Republicans may have had the upper hand by focusing on the least popular and most controversial abortions, Republicans take on more popular issues like contraception at their peril. \"It's reminded people that these aren't folks that just want to maybe ban a tiny percentage of outrageous-sounding abortions \u2014 late-term or abortions for reasons that people don't acknowledge as legitimate \u2014 but rather a full-scale assault on all legalized abortion and on forms of contraception,\" he said. \"The dirty little secret of the right-to-life movement is that an awful lot of them think that practices that nearly all Americans consider contraception \u2014 everything from Plan B to intrauterine devices to the pill \u2014 they regard those as abortion devices, not as contraceptives. And anything that draws attention to the radicalism of conservatives on contraceptives is really bad news for Republicans.\" Franzonello, however, says it's President Obama who's been the radical. \"It really has been an extreme four years,\" she said, citing White House action on issues like embryonic stem cell research and conscience protections for health care workers. Complicating the debate this year has been a series of missteps by Republican House and Senate candidates, starting with Missouri Rep. Todd Akin's now infamous claim last summer that women who are the subject of \"legitimate rape\" can somehow prevent pregnancy. Indiana Senate hopeful Richard Mourdock is now trailing in the polls after he said that pregnancy following rape \"is something God intended to happen.\" And, before walking the statement back, Illinois Rep. Joe Walsh said that abortion is never needed to save a woman's life, thanks to \"modern technology and science.\" \"As long as you have Todd Akin and Richard Mourdock and Joe Walsh and others reminding people that this is an argument within a coalition that wants to ban abortions generally, over whether to exempt a handful or an even tinier handful, it doesn't work very well for Republicans,\" Kilgore said. In the end, though, as always, it depends on which side is able to turn out its voters. And that won't be known until the votes are counted.",

Republicans are hoping to gain control of the U.S. Senate. The path toward victory had Indiana solidly on their side. That was, until Indiana's treasurer Richard Mourdock beat longtime Sen. Richard Lugar in the primary. Then, during a debate on Oct. 23, Mourdock and his Democratic opponent, Congressman Joe Donnelly, were asked about abortion and contraception. Like Donnelly, Mourdock said he was against abortion. \"The only exception I have ... to have on abortion is in that case of the life of the mother. I struggled with it myself for a long time, but I came to realize life is that gift from God,\" Mourdock said. \"And I think even when life begins in that horrible situation of rape, that it is something that God intended to happen.\" It's the second time in recent months that a Republican Senate candidate has jeopardized a victory with comments about rape and abortion. Congressman Todd Akin is behind in the polls in Missouri after a similar remark in August. Mourdock's comments have put him in the same bind; his statement sent a shudder through the Republican Party. GOP presidential nominee Mitt Romney had only just waded into the campaign, cutting a commercial for Mourdock. His campaign was quick to say that the nominee disagreed with Mourdock. Mourdock says his comments were misinterpreted for political gain. \"When I walked off the stage, I expected, walking to my green room, to get high-fives because I had no idea that the statement that I made would possibly go a direction that it went,\" he told reporters a few days later in Greenfield. \"I didn't think that anyone could possibly begin to take those words and construe a meaning from them that was never intended and certainly never meant.\" Mourdock remains beloved by conservatives and members of the Tea Party, especially after defeating Lugar, a fellow Republican. Carol Stover, owner of Carol's Cornerstone Cafe, opened her restaurant to the Mourdock campaign. \"I think it's been blown out of proportion, really. I think he made a mistake, and he's probably sorry for it. Maybe. I don't know,\" she says. \"But it doesn't bother me. It doesn't stand in my way. ... Everybody has their opinion.\" Stover says she already voted for Mourdock, and his debate statement wouldn't have made a difference if she hadn't. Many other women apparently aren't as forgiving. A new poll shows Donnelly with a lead, largely thanks to women. The Democrat is trying to pick up those women and moderates turned off by Mourdock. \"I think Indiana's tradition has always been people like Richard Lugar, people like Evan Bayh, who have always tried to make sure that good decisions and sound decisions are made,\" Donnelly says. In his stump speech, Donnelly rarely \u2014 if ever \u2014 mentions the Democratic Party or President Obama. That's probably shrewd politics in a state that will likely vote solidly for Romney. \"That's where my focus is. Those other races will take care of themselves, but I'm doing everything I can on the Senate level,\" he says. Other people are focusing on the Indiana race as well: 24 million in outside money has poured into the contest \u2014 $8 million of which came in the last week.",

            "article_content": "The battleground state of Wisconsin has a higher percentage of older voters than the national average. Recently, it's also had a volatile political history, including an effort to recall the governor. Older voters at the Middleton Senior Center discuss their experiences and the issues driving their decisions now.  RENEE MONTAGNE, HOST: In recent days, voters in Wisconsin have been experiencing a political whirlwind. They've been visited by Republican vice presidential candidate Paul Ryan, former president Bill Clinton, President Obama himself - that's today - and in the next couple of days, Joe Biden and Mitt Romney. Polls show the presidential race in Wisconsin is tight, the Senate race is a dead heat and older voters could determine the outcome. Baby boomers and senior citizens make up more than half of the electorate. And as NPR's Ina Jaffe reports, studies show older voters are much more likely to turn out than younger ones. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) INA JAFFE, BYLINE: The jazz band gets together every Thursday morning at Middleton Wisconsin's Senior Center. It's a gathering place for retirees in the former farm town turned suburb of Madison. Mike Clipson plays trombone. He's voting for president Obama and here's why. MIKE CLIPSON: I think the economy is going to continue to improve at a slow rate for the next four years no matter who's president. But how we handle things in the Middle East and with North Korea and other parts of the world, I think, is going to be very critical. JAFFE: Clipson is 58 years old and retired from the insurance industry. So he's a baby boomer, and they have a tendency to vote Democratic somewhat more than voters over 65. Carol Troia is a 74-year-old retired hairdresser. CAROL TROIA: At the very beginning I was going to vote for all Republican. JAFFE: Instead, she voted early for Barack Obama and for Democratic Senate candidate Tammy Baldwin, even though Troia  wrinkles her nose like she just got a whiff of spoiled milk when she says Baldwin's name. TROIA: I'm not real fond of her, but I'll take her over Thompson. JAFFE: That's Republican candidate Tommy Thompson, a former Wisconsin governor, who's race with Baldwin is neck and neck. Carol Troia says she turned away from the Republican candidates after watching debates and viewing TV commercials. She says a lot of things bothered her, especially Romney's views on women's issues. TROIA: I think a woman has a right to decide what she wants to do. He wants to abolish Planned Parenthood, Roe versus Wade. He doesn't know that much about foreign policy. And he's got an awfully lot of money, which he's proud of. JAFFE: Why should he not be proud of that? TROIA: I just don't think it should be thrown in people's faces. ROSS MCVEY: How does Santiago embody Hemingway's idea of manhood? We ask this entire group of women. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) JAFFE: Ross McVey leads the book club's discussion of Ernest Hemingway's the \"Old Man and the Sea.\" His wife Vicky is also in the group. Both are 69 years old. He's a retired accountant, she's a retired teacher, they're voting a straight Republican ticket. MCVEY: I probably chose Mr. Romney as the lesser of two evils. My feeling is that politics has led us towards a socialist type of government and so I'm opposed to Mr. Obama. It's sort of a vote for Romney, against Obama. VICKY MCVEY: And I really worry about the economy. JAFFE: That's Vicky McVey, who's disappointed in the president. MCVEY: In four years, he didn't really help the economy as he promised, and now he says give me four more. Is it going to be the same? That's what I worry about. JAFFE: If you've been waiting for a discussion of Medicare in this story, you will be disappointed. None of the older voters we interviewed at the senior center brought it up. When we asked, no one seemed too worried about it. They were more concerned about the impact of Wisconsin's recent history. UNIDENTIFIED GROUP: (Chanting) Recall Walker. Recall Walker. JAFFE: Last year, when Republican Governor Scott Walker moved to repeal most collective bargaining rights for public employees, Wisconsinites protested in the tens of thousands. A move to recall Walker failed, but the wounds haven't healed, says Ross McVey. MCVEY: I think all that did was separate people even more. I think the divide is a lot bigger, a wider than it ever was, which is bad. JAFFE: That's one of the few things that Wisconsin's Republicans and Democrats agree on these days. JAMES WILLET: I can't stand the extremism of either right or left. JAFFE: That's 59-year-old James Willett, the jazz band's bass player. WILLET: Eventually, in order to get anything done, you have to come together and compromise. Oh, my gosh, what a foreign word by these days. JAFFE: But the people here are old enough to remember the days when compromise actually used to happen sometimes. I'm a Jaffe, NPR News. Copyright \u00a9 2012 NPR.  All rights reserved.

            "article_content": "After barnstorming through half a dozen battleground states this week, President Obama stopped in Chicago to vote. He became the first sitting president to vote early in person.  STEVE INSKEEP, HOST: It's MORNING EDITION, from NPR News. I'm Steve Inskeep. RENEE MONTAGNE, HOST: And I'm Renee Montagne. One ad for President Obama illustrates this campaign's final phase. INSKEEP: Lena Dunham, the 26-year-old creator of the TV series \"Girls,\" looks at the camera and talks of your first time. (SOUNDBITE OF POLITICAL ADVERTISEMENT) LENA DUNHAM: Your first time shouldn't be with just anybody. You want to do it with a great guy. It should be with a guy with beautiful - someone who really cares about and understands women. INSKEEP: Dunham means your first time voting. The Obama campaign hopes to boost the youth vote. MONTAGNE: Democrats, who've been expressing delight with this ad, and Republicans, some of whom call it cringe-worthy, take different approaches to voter turnout. INSKEEP: For example, the president broke with tradition yesterday and voted in Chicago, hoping to promote early voting. Here's NPR's Scott Horsley. SCOTT HORSLEY, BYLINE: The polling place at Chicago's Martin Luther King Community Center is supposed to be a campaign-free zone. President Obama couldn't resist offering a few thoughts yesterday on how easy and convenient it is to vote days or even weeks before a Tuesday in early November. PRESIDENT BARACK OBAMA: If something happens on Election Day, you will have already taken care of it. If it's bad weather, you won't get wet - or in Chicago, snowy. HORSLEY: Minutes earlier, Mr. Obama had cast his own ballot, after a Chicago elections official gave some close scrutiny to the president's ID. OBAMA: Did you just look and see? (LAUGHTER) OBAMA: Did you guys see that? HORSLEY: Presidents and presidential candidates have traditionally summoned the cameras to record their vote on Election Day. But Mr. Obama was eager to shine a spotlight on early voting, which is a growing phenomenon in many states and a key ingredient in the president's re-election strategy. Republicans generally downplay the strategic significance of early voting. They say while it might be convenient, they don't believe it adds much to the overall pool of voters. In other words, every vote that's cast early is one fewer coming in on Election Day. The Obama campaign looks at early voting very differently. JEN PSAKI: Our view is that early voting is an opportunity to get people out who may not otherwise go to the polls on Election Day. HORSLEY: Jen Psaki is a campaign spokeswoman. PSAKI: People are busy. I know. They're working double shifts. They're in school. They're picking up their kids from soccer practice. So a vote before Election Day can actually be more valuable than a vote on Election Day. HORSLEY: That's why early voting was a big part of the president's message at nearly every stop on this week's whirlwind campaign odyssey, which took Mr. Obama from the Mississippi River to the Rocky Mountains, the desert Southwest to the Gulf Coast of Florida, and finally to the all-important industrial heartland of Ohio. (SOUNDBITE OF SPEECH) OBAMA: You notice my voice is getting a little hoarse. But I'm just going to keep on keepin' on until every single person out there who needs to vote is going to go vote. HORSLEY: Along the way, Mr. Obama telephoned campaign volunteers and undecided voters, paying special attention to African-Americans, Latinos, union members and women. Supporter Laura Starkey, who introduced the president in Tampa, talked about her own reliance as a single mother on Planned Parenthood for health care. Republican Mitt Romney wants to strip government funding for that. (SOUNDBITE OF SPEECH) LAURA STARKEY: Mitt Romney doesn't get it. For him and his buddies, Planned Parenthood is a villain and a punching bag. No matter what he says otherwise, just look at the company he keeps and the candidates he endorses. That's Romney's vision for America's women: where Washington politicians can tell us what we can and can't do with our bodies. HORSLEY: The Obama campaign has been reminding women this week about Governor Romney's support for Indiana Senate candidate Richard Mourdock, who sparked controversy when he said that abortion is wrong even in the case of rape, because if a rape victim becomes pregnant, it's what God intended. While Romney also opposes abortion, he would make an exception in rape cases. After logging thousands of miles over the last two days, Mr. Obama is home in Washington today. But aides predict a pedal-to-the-metal campaign schedule between now and November 6th. (SOUNDBITE OF SONG, \"SIGNED, SEALED, DELIVERED\") STEVIE WONDER: (Singing) Like a fool I went and stayed too long. Now I'm wondering if your love's still strong. Ooh, baby. Here I am, signed, sealed, delivered. I'm yours. HORSLEY: As he tries to close the deal with voters, Mr. Obama has adopted a familiar musical cue from his 2008 campaign. His rallies now end with Stevie Wonder echoing the president's call to get ballots signed, sealed and delivered. Scott Horsley, NPR News, Washington. Copyright \u00a9 2012 NPR.  All rights reserved.

The decisive role female voters may play in the key battleground state of New Hampshire hasn't been lost on President Obama and his political allies. If Democrats sweep the swing state's major races on Election Day, New Hampshire would become the first state to have women hold its entire congressional delegation and the governor's office. Obama would also pick up four potentially crucial electoral votes. \"We have held hundreds of events targeting women voters,\" said Harrell Kirstein, a spokesman for the Obama campaign in New Hampshire. These have ranged from \"Women's Wednesdays\" mixers to visits by fair pay advocate Lilly Ledbetter and Democratic National Committee Chairwoman Debbie Wasserman Schultz. On Wednesday, Cecile Richards, president of the Planned Parenthood Action Fund, visited New Hampshire to kick off a multitown phone-banking effort. Republican Mitt Romney also has made New Hampshire a focus of his campaign, both in ad spending and on-the-ground appearances. He has an event scheduled on Oct. 30 in Manchester, just a week before the election, and his campaign is focusing on a get-out-the-vote effort. Romney also has used New Hampshire Republican Sen. Kelly Ayotte as a prolific surrogate for Romney in the state. Ayotte, who at one point was discussed as a potential running mate for Romney, helped the GOP do well with women locally in 2010, when she was easily elected to the Senate. Sen. Kelly Ayotte, R-N.H., campaigns with Mitt Romney in Portsmouth, N.H., on April 30.\n                \n                    \n                    Jim Cole/AP\n                    \n                \nhide caption Sen. Kelly Ayotte, R-N.H., campaigns with Mitt Romney in Portsmouth, N.H., on April 30. \"This is an important state. It's an important state in large part because of the state Legislature,\" Richards said. It's no coincidence Richards makes that argument. During a rally in Manchester last week, Obama went so far as to suggest state politics might have a coattail effect \u2014 up ticket. \"You've got a state Legislature up here that sometimes acts like it knows better than women when it comes to women's own health care decisions,\" Obama said. \"Well, my opponent's got the same approach.\" In 2010, Republicans swept to 3 to 1 majorities in Concord. While members of the GOP stressed fiscal issues on the campaign trail, abortion and women's health care issues became flash points once they took office. Republicans moved to block a state contract with Planned Parenthood and pushed bills to limit abortion. They also tried to undo a 12-year-old law requiring insurers to include contraception coverage in all prescription drug plans. All of these controversies tend to get mentioned in the stump speeches of Democratic gubernatorial candidate Maggie Hassan. \"What's important to understand is that we respect women, their ability to make their own decisions, and that's why we stay focused on the fact that this is just not a place where government should interfere,\" Hassan said. The GOP nominee for governor, Ovide Lamontagne, supported a Human Life Amendment, which would give constitutional protections to fetuses, when he ran for U.S. Senate two years ago. For him, restricting abortion has been a longtime goal, but it wouldn't, he insists, be a top priority if he wins the corner office. \"I am not running to advance that agenda; I am running on a jobs and economy agenda,\" he said. Even so, the most recent University of New Hampshire Survey Center poll showed big gender-gap edges for Democrats. Obama had a 23-point edge over Romney among female voters; Hassan led Lamontagne by 18 points with women. Lamontagne's newest radio ad suggests he hopes to reduce that gap. It features Ayotte, the most prominent Republican woman in elective office in the state, who opposes legal abortion in most instances. The ad focuses on taxes, but it's called, tellingly perhaps, \"One of Us.\" New Hampshire's other U.S. senator is Democrat Jeanne Shaheen. In the state's House races, Republican Rep. Frank Guinta faces Democrat and former Rep. Carol Shea-Porter; and Republican Rep. Charles Bass faces Democrat Ann McLane Kuster.",

Reporters from four public media stations on the West Coast have been working on a project to find out what is \u2014 or isn't \u2014 motivating young voters to take part in the political process this year. A Gallup poll in July found that only 58 percent of 18-to-29-year-olds say they intend to vote this year, the lowest of any age group. But it's an important demographic for the election hopes of both President Obama and Republican Mitt Romney. As many as 1 in 4 eligible voters this year are in that age group, according to NDN, a liberal think tank in Washington, D.C. \"From the West Coast: Voices of Young Voters\" features millennials talking about politics, the election and the future of the country. You can find more at the four participating stations: KQED in San Francisco, KPCC in Los Angeles, Oregon Public Broadcasting in Portland and KPLU in Tacoma, Wash.  \"We wanted to represent the geographic diversity of Oregon and get outside of the urban areas that tend to be more liberal,\" said Amanda Peacher of Oregon Public Broadcasting. \"In the cities, we did encounter a lot of people who identify as progressive. But we also met a number of passionate young folks who identify as conservative, or who don't align with any particular political party. And in rural areas, we talked to 20-somethings who support Obamacare and same-sex marriage.\" Lillian Mongeau of KQED in San Francisco said: \"The surprise was that even those planning to vote for Mitt Romney [about 10 percent of our sample] said they were socially liberal. To them, 'small government' was consistent with 'no social regulations.' In fact, students on all parts of the political spectrum had adopted the 'liberty' language of the Tea Party to explain how they felt about the government interfering in their personal lives.\" In Los Angeles, Kim Bui at KPCC said: \"What surprises me most is the level of engagement these students have. For being a generation that is increasingly called self centered and apathetic, so far, even if someone is undecided, our interviews are full of engaged students who know their vote matters and will definitely head to the voting booth.\"   But in Washington state, many of those who showed interest in politics said that didn't necessarily mean they would vote. \"It was surprising how engaged these young eligible voters were on issues ranging from gay marriage to abortion and birth control to student loans,\" said Dave Kellogg at KPLU. \"Yet when asked whether they planned to vote, many said no, or at best, maybe. Reasons for their reluctance varied, but common threads included being turned off from the political fighting, the belief that their vote wouldn't make a difference, and doubts as to whether they understood the issues enough to bother to participate.\" Ian Hill is responsible for outreach, engagement and social media for news at KQED in San Francisco.",

            "article_content": "Republican nominee Mitt Romney campaigned Tuesday in Nevada and Colorado.  RENEE MONTAGNE, HOST: When Mitt Romney was a young man, his father wrote him a letter which included a quote from Robert Louis Stevenson: Despair not, but if you despair, work on in your despair. Just a few weeks ago, some pundits thought the Romney campaign should be on the verge of despair. Now he's racing to the finish of a very close race. He met up with running mate Paul Ryan for a rally just outside Las Vegas and a nighttime event in Denver. NPR's Ari Shapiro is traveling with the Romney campaign. ARI SHAPIRO, BYLINE: For the Romney campaign, momentum is the catchword of the moment. In the last few weeks the challenger has brought national polls into an effective tie. He's still a bit behind in a few important swing states, so the candidate is putting all his weight behind turning this tie into a win. MITT ROMNEY: And these debates have supercharged our campaign, there's no question about it. We're seeing more and more enthusiasm, more and more support. SHAPIRO: Six thousand people filled an outdoor amphitheater near Las Vegas as the running mates took the stage together on a bright sunny afternoon. ROMNEY: We've gone through four debates with the vice presidential debate and my debates. And we haven't heard an agenda from the president and that's why his campaign is taking on water and our campaign is full speed ahead. SHAPIRO: The logic of Romney's argument is not obvious. President Obama and Vice President Biden together won three of the four debates, but Romney advisor Kevin Madden says the campaign's approach to the debates never focused on a win-lose tally. He spoke to reporters on the airplane to Nevada. KEVIN MADDEN: Rather than taking them debate by debate, the debates collectively, the goal was to give people a sense of exactly what he would do as president. I think the debates as a whole have largely been a success as a result. SHAPIRO: The campaign believes the first debate helped Romney cross an important threshold. It let people see the challenger as a viable president. And Romney's aides say the next two presidential debates solidified that image, no matter whether he won or lost. People in the crowd at Romney's Nevada rally share this view. Lisa Baylash is closing down her Pilates studio after business dried up. LISA BAYLASH: And I think the first debate put him in the driver's seat and I think that Obama looked scared and I think they are scared and that's why they come up with the \u2014 all they have is the birth control and the Big Bird and the binders and all that stupid stuff that doesn't make a difference. And I think that what's going on, Mitt Romney's using facts and he's going to take action when he takes office. SHAPIRO: Virginia Fennigan is a retiree. VIRGINIA FENNIGAN: Oh, I'm so excited. We're all so energized. You can feel the wave coming in after the first debate. I worked in the office all the time, the campaign offices, and it's marvelous the response we're getting. SHAPIRO: From Nevada, Romney flew to Colorado. ROMNEY: Thank you, Colorado. SHAPIRO: The Red Rocks Amphitheater is carved into the stone outside of Denver. Twelve thousand supporters filled the stands. Some wore colored T-shirts that forms the shape of a giant Colorado flag. Cliff faces towering over the auditorium seats were awash with blue light and a white Romney logo. ROMNEY: Boy, what a - what a place this is. SHAPIRO: Democrats say it's hypocritical of Romney and Ryan to campaign at this place that was built with government money. It's the sort of public works project that Democrats want more of and Republicans find wasteful. Romney said his campaign is on the rise while President Obama's is receding. ROMNEY: It's why this movement is growing across the country and it's why we need you to go out and get other people and recruit you to this cause because we need to take back America and get America strong again, providing for our citizens a bright and prosperous future. SHAPIRO: A few states away, unexpected events distracted from Romney's message. Republican Indiana Senate candidate Richard Mourdoch said he believes that pregnancies caused by rape are God's will. Romney has endorsed and campaigned with Mourdoch and appears in a new ad for him. A Romney campaign spokeswoman says Romney does not agree with Mourdoch's statement about rape and pregnancy, but Romney has not withdrawn his support for Mourdoch.

            "article_content": "With the presidential debates wrapped up, President Obama began a blitz of six battleground states Tuesday.  STEVE INSKEEP, HOST: It's MORNING EDITION from NPR News. I'm Steve Inskeep. RENEE MONTAGNE, HOST: And I'm Renee Montagne. Good morning. The presidential candidates have yet to undergo one of the rituals of running for the nation's highest office. They have yet to publicly run themselves into the ground. INSKEEP: In past years, Bill Clinton sometimes campaigned all night. Bob Dole went for 96 hours. George W. Bush could visit five states in one day. And John Kerry actually lost his voice. MONTAGNE: This year, President Obama has a day job while Mitt Romney has generally, up to now, done fewer public events in favor of fundraisers and debate prep. Now the pace accelerates for both men. Today, the president begins a cross country campaign trip that will take him to half a dozen battleground states in less than 48 hours. INSKEEP: He was in Ohio yesterday. And in an answer to critics who say he hasn't laid out a big second term agenda, his campaign offered a summary of his plans. NPR's Scott Horsley is traveling with the president. SCOTT HORSLEY, BYLINE: President Obama won this week's foreign policy debate in part by arguing that Governor Romney has been all over the map, saying one thing one day and something else a short time later. The president is trying to make the same case about his Republican rival's domestic polices. Whether it's taxes, school funding or birth control, he says, Governor Romney keeps changing his stripes. PRESIDENT BARACK OBAMA: You want to know that the person who's applying to be your president and commander-in-chief is trustworthy. That he means what he says. That he's not just making stuff up, depending on whether it's convenient or not. HORSLEY: In Dayton, Ohio, Mr. Obama focused on the rescue of the auto industry and Romney's 2008 editorial opposing a government bailout, which was famously headlined \"Let Detroit Go Bankrupt.\" OBAMA: The people of Dayton don't forget. UNIDENTIFIED CROWD: No. OBAMA: The people of Ohio don't forget. UNIDENTIFIED CROWD: No. OBAMA: If Mitt Romney had been president when the auto industry was on the verge of collapse, we might not have an American auto industry today. HORSLEY: Governor Romney notes that GM and Chrysler ultimately did go through a managed bankruptcy, similar to what he proposed. But Romney would have limited the government's role to guaranteeing private financing. Former auto czar Steven Rattner calls that an utter fantasy, saying in the depths of the financial crisis there was no private financing to be had. Mr. Obama says under Governor Romney's plan, the U.S. might be buying its cars from China. OBAMA: I wasn't about to let Detroit go bankrupt, or Toledo go bankrupt, or Lordstown go bankrupt. I bet on American workers. I bet on American manufacturing. I would do it again because that bet has paid off for Ohio and for America in a big way. (SOUNDBITE OF CHEERING) HORSLEY: Earlier, the president held a rally in Delray Beach, Florida, where he was introduced by a certain pizza shop owner, whose burly image went viral last month when Mr. Obama made an unannounced visit to his restaurant. SCOTT VAN DUZER: You and the Secret Service might remember it from the bear hug I gave him. (LAUGHTER) DUZER: But I remember it more for the hope and the confidence that he gave me. HORSLEY: As a small business owner, Scott Van Duzer told the crowd he's embraced Mr. Obama in more ways than one. DUZER: I'm a Republican, but hold it there. (SOUNDBITE OF CROWD CHATTER) DUZER: Hold it right there. I voted for him four years ago, and you can bet - you know what - I'm voting for him again. (SOUNDBITE OF CHEERING) HORSLEY: Van Duzer says his business is better now than it was four years ago. Florida's unemployment rate is 8.7 percent, higher than the national average but well below its peak of 11.4 percent. Mr. Obama told the crowd of 11,000 yesterday the economy is not where it needs to be but its making progress. OBAMA: Yes, we've been through tough times. But you've never seen me quit. UNIDENTIFIED CROWD: No. OBAMA: And there's no quit in America. HORSLEY: The Obama campaign echoes that message in a new TV ad. And yesterday the campaign released a glossy brochure, summing up the president's goals to boost manufacturing, decrease dependence on imported oil, and foster a well-trained workforce. Most of the ideas in the plan are not new and any payoff is likely to be far in the future. But Mr. Obama has always taken the long view. Spotting a group of elementary school students along his motorcade route yesterday, the president called them over and offered a private pep talk. OBAMA: I need you guys to make sure that you're doing your homework, listening to your teachers, and listening to your parents. OK? You going to promise to do that? UNIDENTIFIED CHILDREN: Yes. HORSLEY: If you do, Mr. Obama said, there's nothing you can't accomplish. You could be a doctor, a lawyer, an astronaut. Or you could end up being president of the United States.

            "article_content": "Mitt Romney appeared to shift his position on contraception in the town hall-style presidential debate last week. And his campaign released an ad, stressing Romney's support for abortion rights under limited circumstances. Social conservatives in Iowa weigh in on whether Romney's shifts on these issues trouble them.  STEVE INSKEEP, HOST: It's MORNING EDITION, from NPR News. Good morning. I'm Steve Inskeep. RENEE MONTAGNE, HOST: And I'm Renee Montagne. The tight presidential race suggests Mitt Romney is picking up some of the independent and undecided voters he was hoping to appeal to. We were wondering about the many conservative voters the Republican candidate tried hard to win over during the primary season. To find out what they're thinking now, NPR's Sonari Glinton went to Iowa, a stronghold of the social conservative movement. SONARI GLINTON, BYLINE: Richard Nixon famously gave Bob Dole some advice about running for president when Dole himself was running against an incumbent Democrat. Essentially, you have to run as far as you can to the right to get the nomination. And to get elected, you have to run as fast as you can back to the middle. Mitt Romney ran as a conservative during the primaries, but over the past month, has tacked to the center on a range of topics - from health care to taxes, to the war in Afghanistan, and on social issues. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED AUDIO) MITT ROMNEY: There's no legislation with regarding - with regards to abortion that I'm familiar with that would become part of my agenda. One thing... GLINTON: That audio clip is from an October 9th interview with the Des Moines Register's editorial board. Afterward, the campaign says, the candidate was proudly pro-life, and he will be a pro-life president. But then came the second presidential debate. (SOUNDBITE OF PRESIDENTIAL DEBATE) ROMNEY: I'd just note that I don't believe that bureaucrats in Washington should tell someone whether they can use contraceptives or not, and I don't believe employers should tell someone whether they could have contraceptive care or not. GLINTON: Again, this seemed to be a change from the primaries, when Romney said he'd support a Senate provision that would've allowed employers to opt out of providing contraception as part of their health care plans. The same day as that debate, the campaign put out this ad. (SOUNDBITE OF POLITICAL ADVERTISEMENT) UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN: You know, those ads saying Mitt Romney would ban all abortions and contraception seemed a bit extreme. So I looked into it. Turns out, Romney doesn't oppose contraception at all. In fact, he thinks abortion should be an option in cases of rape, incest or to save a mother's life. BOB VANDER PLAATS: Well, it does give me pause. GLINTON: Bob Vander Plaats is CEO of the Family Leader, a conservative group in Iowa. PLAATS: But I think I've come to the realization - as well as many other social conservatives and value voters - is that whether it's Barack Obama or whether it's Mitt Romney on the issue of sanctity of human life, we're probably uncomfortable with both. But we're more uncomfortable in Barack Obama than we are with Mitt Romney, as well as we know that he would have Paul Ryan whispering in his ear on the sanctity of human life. GLINTON: Vander Plaats says in addition to adding Ryan to the ticket, Governor Romney's strong demeanor in the debate - as much anything he said - gave social conservatives confidence. At a Republican women's viewing party for this week's debate, I met Christi Taylor of West Des Moines. She says she's conservative and supports Mitt Romney, and for her, the economy trumps social issues. CHRISTI TAYLOR: We need to lower our debt. Everybody agrees with that. We have to create more jobs. We have to get people back to work. We have to get people stronger education. We have to do something about health care without spending anywhere close to what they're talking about spending. GLINTON: Meanwhile, Connie Schmett considers herself a values voter, and says she's also fully being the Romney campaign, in part because she wants a new president. CONNIE SCHMETT: And if we don't have new leadership within the next four years, I am so afraid that I will not have a country for my children. GLINTON: How do you hold the Republican candidate's feet to the fire about, you know, issues of life and things like that? SCHMETT: I don't think you can. I think you can put the platform in place. You have letter campaigns. You can say, hey, this is what you promised me, but you cannot absolutely hold that person responsible. GLINTON: Schmett says she can only hope Mitt Romney won't forget social conservatives if he's elected. But she says, more importantly, a Democrat wouldn't remember them at all.

            "article_content": "Radio may sound so early 20th century, but it remains a key part of the ad strategies for the Obama and Romney campaigns \u2014 albeit under the radar for the most part. The candidates and their supporters use radio as a way to narrow cast to targeted demographic groups. And it's a way to reach base voters with messages that might not appeal to \u2014 and in fact could turn off \u2014 a wider audience.  MELISSA BLOCK, HOST: You are listening to ALL THINGS CONSIDERED from NPR News. This campaign season most of us have been bombarded by political ads on TV. Those ads get the most attention from fact-checkers and opposing campaigns, but the presidential candidates are also running lots of spots on commercial radio stations. It gives them a chance to target particular kinds of people, as NPR's Brian Naylor reports. BRIAN NAYLOR, BYLINE: Radio and politics have a long and rich partnership dating back to the medium's infancy. In 1924, Calvin Coolidge bought air time to broadcast his speeches. Now, nearly 100 years later, presidential candidates are still using radio but with a difference. University of Missouri professor Marvin Overby says the nation's more than 11,000 commercial stations are being used not so much to broadcast but to narrow cast. MARVIN OVERBY: They tend to be very program driven, and a lot of that is going to revolve around the music that the station chooses to play, and music tends to track demographics very well. So you don't have middle-aged white soccer moms listening to the same radio stations as 20-something urban African-Americans. NAYLOR: As a result, Overby says it's much easier for campaigns to target their messages using radio than with TV. For instance, here is an Obama campaign ad aimed at African-Americans listening to urban radio. (SOUNDBITE OF AD) UNIDENTIFIED MAN #1: Four years ago, we made history. Now, it's time to move forward and finish what we started together. We have to show the president we have his back. UNIDENTIFIED GROUP: (Singing) We've got your back. PRESIDENT BARACK OBAMA: We can't afford to spend the next four years going backwards. I'm running... NAYLOR: The Romney campaign, meanwhile, recently rolled out an ad for Spanish language radio aimed at Latino voters. It features the comedian Paul Rodriguez. (SOUNDBITE OF AD) PAUL RODRIGUEZ: (Foreign language spoken) NAYLOR: Romney has a plan to create 12 million jobs, Rodriguez says, reduce the debt and reform education. President Obama tried but couldn't do it. Outside groups, which are spending millions for and against the presidential candidates, are also using radio. Planned Parenthood is airing this pro-Obama spot in the battleground states of Ohio and Virginia. (SOUNDBITE OF AD) UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN #1: Here's what Romney said. MITT ROMNEY: The actions I'll take immediately are to remove funding for Planned Parenthood. UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN #1: That's cancer screenings and birth control for millions of women that Romney is vowing to take away. NAYLOR: Americans for Prosperity, the Republican-leaning issues group funded by the billionaire Koch brothers, is airing this ad in Virginia's coal country. (SOUNDBITE OF AD) UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN #2: Listen to President Obama's own words. OBAMA: Under my plan of a cap-and-trade system, electricity rates would necessarily skyrocket. UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN #2: Tell President Obama his policies are hurting Virginians. Go to failingagenda.com to stand with coal and sign the petition. America's... NAYLOR: Because radio often flies under the radar, it's used by campaigns to air negative ads aimed at a candidate's base but which might turn off a larger audience. John Geer, a political scientist at Vanderbilt, says a Democratic Senate candidate from Tennessee was the target of one controversial ad six years ago. JOHN GEER: There was an ad here against Harold Ford that had a theme of tom-toms in the background. It had, you know, it had an imagery of kind of an African beat to it which I had never seen in a political ad before, but, of course, they were sending a racial message. (SOUNDBITE OF AD) UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN #3: Harold Ford Jr. grew up in D.C., Bob Corker in Tennessee. (SOUNDBITE OF AD) NAYLOR: Campaigns also like the radio because it's harder to tune out as it were. Viewers watching TV can DVR past the commercials or get up off the couch for a snack when the ads come on. Not so easy to do when you're in the car driving home. Brian Naylor, NPR News, Washington.

            "article_content": "Onlookers listen as President Obama speaks Friday in Fairfax, Va., about the choice facing women in the election.\n                \n                    \n                    Carolyn Kaster/AP\n                    \n                \nhide caption Onlookers listen as President Obama speaks Friday in Fairfax, Va., about the choice facing women in the election. After President Obama's self-described somnolent first debate performance, his female supporters lit up social media and tagged the campaign with complaints about his failure to talk about their issues, from pay equity to health and reproductive rights. He's been playing catch-up ever since, focusing on shoring up his party's two-decade-long domination with female voters who are key to Obama's hold on the White House. After focusing squarely on women in the second debate this week with GOP challenger Mitt Romney, Obama has followed up with stump speeches that jabbed his opponent for his now-infamous \"binders full of women\" comment, and characterizing him as a throwback to the 1950s. And at a rally Friday in Fairfax, Va., with Cecile Richards, the president of Planned Parenthood, Obama unveiled a new attack line, accusing Romney of being afflicted with \"Romnesia\" about his past positions \u2014 including his previous support for legal abortion, and confusion over his position on the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act. It all makes for lively copy and loads of laughs at Romney's expense on late night comedy shows \u2014 from Jimmy Kimmel's \"Swimmin' in Women\" Romney parody ad, to Conan O'Brien's joke that the Republican is wooing women by promising \"more Ryan Gosling movies.\" But just weeks after polls conducted in the wake of Romney's secretly recorded \"47 percent\" comments suggested that Obama had an opportunity to improve on his dominating 2008 performance with female voters \u2014 exit polls showed him capturing 56 percent of the vote \u2014 he is now in the position of battling Romney to keep a high enough share to win. A Pew Research Center survey taken last month, before the first presidential debate, found that likely female voters nationally preferred Obama by a nearly 20-point margin, driven, in part, by their more favorable view of the government's role in the social safety net. Pew's latest poll had women evenly divided between Obama and Romney. The Romney campaign? Its argument off-air has been that women are more than the sum of their reproductive parts, and its public political message to women has been about jobs and the economy, and how female workers and their families have been buffeted by the recession. That resonates with voters like Jillian Batchelor, a Las Vegas Realtor and married mother of three. She voted for Obama in 2008, but won't again. Moved by economic issues, she says she's wary about Obamacare and its associated costs, and, outside the housing market pickup, says she doesn't see other conditions improving. Batchelor says she disagrees with both parties on certain issues, but gives Romney the edge, saying, \"It just couldn't hurt to get someone new in there.\" While the Romney campaign hones in on women like Batchelor \u2014 disaffected 2008 Obama voters who are focused on economic issues \u2014 Democrats, and Obama, are going all in on reproductive rights. An analysis released Friday by Kantar Media's CMAG political advertising analysts reported a proliferation in ads for Democrats that feature \"mentions of abortion, contraception and funding for Planned Parenthood.\" The ads, according to CMAG's Harley Ellenberger, are being run on the presidential, Senate, House and state-race level. The crowd joins Republican Mitt Romney in singing the national anthem at a rally Wednesday in Chesapeake, Va.\n                \n                    \n                    Emmanuel Dunand/AFP/Getty Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption The crowd joins Republican Mitt Romney in singing the national anthem at a rally Wednesday in Chesapeake, Va. \"Their growing reliance on this traditional social issue may be for turnout purposes,\" according to a CMAG analysis, \"but also suggests their economic-themed ads aimed at women are having a more muddled impact.\" CMAG reports that a month ago, ads mentioning the issues of abortion, contraception and Planned Parenthood were airing in 14 races around the country. This past week, it found such ads being used in 50 races. The issues are crucial to many women who support Obama, but others, like Dallany Santos, 33, who works at a Las Vegas hotel, say they are more moved by what the president has to say about economic fairness, health care, unions and the middle class. Santos says it was Romney's \"47 percent\" comments that rankled her more than any position he's had on reproductive issues. Romney running mate Paul Ryan perhaps did his ticket few favors when, at a Thursday fundraiser in Florida, he tweaked the Democrats for accusing Republicans of waging a war on women. \"Now it's a war on women, tomorrow it's going to be a war on left-handed Irishmen or something like that,\" Ryan said, according to ABC News. Not quite on the level of Romney's \"47 percent,\" but in this supercharged battle for the favor of female voters, you can bet that Ryan's comments will soon join the \"binders\" video clip in the Obama campaign portfolio.",

Jeff Flake shake hands before Thursday's debate in Chandler, Ariz.\n                \n                    \n                    Ross Franklin/AP\n                    \n                \nhide caption Democrat Richard Carmona (left) and Republican Rep. Jeff Flake shake hands before Thursday's debate in Chandler, Ariz. For the first time in nearly a generation, Arizona voters will elect a new senator. Republican Sen. Jon Kyl is retiring after 18 years. His ideological successor is Republican Rep. Jeff Flake, and a lot of people expected Flake to have an easy time of it. But recent polls suggest Democrat Richard Carmona \u2014 a former surgeon general and a Hispanic \u2014 has a shot at winning. The race has become heated, and the airwaves are filled with brutal ads. \"Many call him the most conservative congressman in Washington,\" is how one ad proudly describes the Republican, who's from a pioneering Mormon family and who has served in Congress since 2001. The ad, paid for by Flake's campaign, portrays him as an early riser who goes jogging before dawn and prepares breakfast with his family before heading to work. It concludes: \"Arizona's battle-tested conservative is Jeff Flake.\" If you're into battle-testing, though, Carmona's resume is hard to beat. He was born in New York's Harlem neighborhood of Puerto Rican descent. One campaign ad features Gary Clark, one of Carmona's Vietnam-era colleagues, describing the candidate as a \"poor kid who quit school and got a second chance in the Army, became a doctor, SWAT team leader and surgeon general.\" Flake and the Republican Party have been tying Carmona to the Obama administration, not necessarily a helpful connection in a state Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney is favored to win. An ad released last month by Flake's campaign says: \"Richard Carmona was recruited [to run for Senate] by Barack Obama. Jeff Flake is supported by Jon Kyl and John McCain,\" Arizona's Republican senators. Carmona, though, served for nearly four years as surgeon general under former President George W. Bush, a Republican. Until a year or so ago, he was a registered independent. In the past, he says Republicans also tried to recruit him for office. \"In an old Republican Party, I might have been able to go with a fiscal conservative approach and smaller government. I'm OK with that,\" Carmona tells NPR. \"But when you look at what's happened in our state and the nation and where the Republican Party has gone, most of my friends who are moderate Republican friends are embarrassed that we're attempting to legislate contraception, defunding Planned Parenthood.\" Carmona is playing the moderate to Flake's conservative stance. Sensing a possible upset, the Democratic Party has spent at least $1 million on ads portraying Flake as too conservative, even for Arizona. They've attacked Flake's positions on abortion and contraception, and highlighted a few of his votes on veterans. Flake says the attacks are exaggerated and misleading. \"Some of the accusations about me and veterans' benefits and women's issues and things like that \u2014 I think at one time they were saying that Jeff Flake wants to return to the time before women could vote,\" Flake tells NPR. \"That gets personal.\" Last week, conflicting polls showed each candidate slightly ahead. The already tough campaign got really personal. The Flake campaign and the National Republican Senatorial Committee released an ad aimed at women, attacking Carmona's temperament. Dr. Cristina Beato, former acting assistant secretary of health between 2003 and 2005, looks into the camera and says Carmona has problems with women, and with anger: \"There was an angry pounding on the door in the middle of the night. I'm a single mom. I feared for my kids and for myself. It was Richard Carmona, and I was his boss. Carmona's not who he seems.\" Beato concludes by saying, Carmona \"should never, ever be in the U.S. Senate.\" Carmona denied the charges. Earlier this year, his campaign manager told Politico, \"Dr. Beato's claims are complete lies.\" Carmona called Beato troubled and countered with his own ad featuring Kathleen Brennan, a retired police captain who was his SWAT team commander, saying Carmona was a \"joy to work with\" when he served in the Pima County, Ariz., sheriff's department, and that he \"treats everyone with respect.\" \"When I see a career politician like Jeff Flake attacking Rich Carmona, who has spent his life helping others, it's despicable,\" Brennan says in the ad. Carmona didn't help himself in a debate Thursday night when he told the male moderator that he was \"prettier\" than CNN's Candy Crowley, who moderated Tuesday's presidential debate. Republicans pounced. Carmona apologized. There's no telling what the effects will be. Early voting has already begun in Arizona.",

            "article_content": "President Obama and his GOP challenger Mitt Romney shared a stage again Thursday night. This time it was at the Al Smith Dinner in New York City, an annual event to raise money for Catholic charities.  RENEE MONTAGNE, HOST: This is MORNING EDITION from NPR News. I'm Renee Montagne. DAVID GREENE, HOST: And I'm David Greene. Good morning. The president and his Republican rival are both holding rallies today in swing states, meaning they'll likely be taking swings at each other's policies and political positions. MONTAGNE: Last night, though, the two men switched from attack lines to laugh lines. Mr. Obama and former Governor Mitt Romney offered a little stand-up comedy at the annual Al Smith Dinner, a fundraiser for Catholic Charities sponsored by the archdiocese of New York. NPR's Scott Horsley was there. SCOTT HORSLEY, BYLINE: Since the days of Kennedy and Nixon, the Al Smith Dinner has become a traditional stop in the intense final weeks of a presidential campaign, a momentary respite from the near-constant mudslinging. Mud would be conspicuously out of place at this white tie affair in New York's Waldorf Astoria Hotel, but just because the players clean up doesn't mean the game is over. Mitt Romney poked fun at himself, at the president, and at the news media. (SOUNDBITE OF EVENT) MITT ROMNEY: And I've already seen early reports from tonight's dinner. Headline: Obama Embraced By Catholics, Romney Dines with Rich People. HORSLEY: President Obama joked that for all their differences, he and his Republican rival still have a good deal in common. (SOUNDBITE OF EVENT) PRESIDENT BARACK OBAMA: Beginning with our unusual names. Actually, Mitt is his middle name. I wish I could use my middle name. HORSLEY: The only other times the two men have shared a stage this fall have been debates. Mr. Obama was much more energetic during their second debate. He joked that's because he was well rested after napping during their first one. (SOUNDBITE OF EVENT) OBAMA: Of course there's a lot of things I learned from that experience. For example, I learned that there are worse things that can happen to you on your anniversary than forgetting to buy a gift. HORSLEY: Governor Romney kidded that he had a special training regimen to get ready for the debates. (SOUNDBITE OF EVENT) ROMNEY: First, refrain from alcohol for 65 years before the debate. Second, find the biggest available straw man and then just mercilessly attack it. Big Bird didn't even see it coming. HORSLEY: The Al Smith Dinner draws a who's who of New York business, cultural and political elites. Some of them became punchlines as well. The master of ceremonies toasted Mayor Michael Bloomberg with the same kind of oversized soft drink Bloomberg has outlawed. Romney targeted New York Governor Andrew Cuomo, who's thought to harbor his own White House ambitions. (SOUNDBITE OF EVENT) ROMNEY: Let me get this straight. The man has put in one term as a governor. He has a father who happened to be a governor. And he thinks that's enough to run for president. HORSLEY: There were no instant polls last night to measure the candidates on their material or their comic timing, but both got their share of laughs and applause. The president and Governor Romney both had kind words for each other as good husbands and fathers. Politics took a back seat, if only for a little while. (SOUNDBITE OF EVENT) OBAMA: In less than three weeks, voters in states like Ohio, Virginia, and Florida will decide this incredibly important election. Which begs the question, what are we doing here? HORSLEY: Cardinal Timothy Dolan, the archbishop of New York, sat between the candidates during the dinner and he got the last word. (SOUNDBITE OF EVENT) CARDINAL TIMOTHY DOLAN: Might I suggest that this annual dinner actually shows the United States of America and the Catholic Church at their best. HORSLEY: Dolan is president of the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops, which has tangled with President Obama over abortion and birth control, and with congressional Republicans over proposed spending cuts that the church says could hurt the most vulnerable in society. Dolan argues that the lesson of the Al Smith Dinner is that you can accomplish a lot more by inviting folks of different political loyalties to an uplifting evening rather than closing the door to them.

This follows the latest presidential debate in which work and family issues created heated discussions \u2014both on the stage and among voters.  DAVID GREENE, HOST: Women are certainly front and center in the presidential campaign. Over the past few days, both Mitt Romney and President Obama have released new ads in an effort to court women. This follows the latest presidential debate where work and family issues created some heated discussions onstage and then among voters. NPR's Jennifer Ludden reports. JENNIFER LUDDEN, BYLINE: The ad wars are becoming as tit-for-tat as this week's debate. Right off the bat was this from the Romney camp, featuring a former Obama voter. (SOUNDBITE OF POLITICAL AD) UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN #1: You know, those ads saying Mitt Romney would ban all abortions and contraception seemed a bit extreme. LUDDEN: So she says she looked into it and discovered Romney doesn't oppose contraception. (SOUNDBITE OF POLITICAL AD) UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN #1: In fact, he thinks abortion should be an option in cases of rape, incest or to save a mother's life. LUDDEN: A day later, the Obama camp responded. An ad to air soon in the swing state of Virginia has CNN's Anderson Cooper asking Romney this at a Republican primary debate: (SOUNDBITE OF POLITICAL AD) ANDERSON COOPER: If Roe v. Wade was overturned, Congress passed a federal ban on all abortions and it came to your desk, would you sign it, yes or no? MITT ROMNEY: Let me say it: I'd be delighted to sign that bill. LUDDEN: In Virginia, in the picturesque town of Occoquan, Mary Ann Christensen was having coffee with a friend this morning. She's a Romney supporter and watched Tuesday's debate, but... MARY ANN CHRISTENSEN: I wasn't paying so much attention to the women, women, women. I was paying attention to the demeanor, and I wasn't really thrilled. LUDDEN: Christensen thought both President Obama and moderator Candy Crawley were too aggressive in cutting off Romney. But she also didn't like seeing Romney try to compete with Mr. Obama on what he can offer women, as when he said all women should have access to contraception. CHRISTENSEN: Why are we focusing on this tiny, little bit to try to sway those few women who may or may not even be on contraception? I think we have much greater issues to worry about. LUDDEN: Namely, she says, the economy and the nation's huge debt. Still, she likes that Romney talked about flex time for his female staffers. A new ad expands on that, featuring a string of women who were Cabinet members when Romney was governor of Massachusetts. (SOUNDBITE OF POLITICAL AD) UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN #2: He totally gets working women, especially women who - like myself - had two young kids. I needed flexibility. LUDDEN: But touting flex time falls flat with undecided voter Linda Caldwell. She owns the coffee house in Occoquan and listened to Tuesday night's debate while working. LINDA CALDWELL: We all have done that. We work nine to five or eight to seven or whatever we had to knowing we had to do it. That was part of our pay. LUDDEN: In fact, Romney's comment that he let a female staffer leave early to make dinner for her kids came in for criticism on all sides. STEPHANIE COONTZ: That might have been progressive 15 or 20 years ago. LUDDEN: Stephanie Coontz is with the nonpartisan Council on Contemporary Families. COONTZ: The rise of dual-earner households and the increased participation of men in doing the cooking and cleaning and picking kids up at daycare suggests that this is an outdated assumption. LUDDEN: The conservative Independent Women's Forum agreed. In a blog post, a policy analyst there also bristled at Romney making a point of hiring women, suggesting it smacks of affirmative action. So, is it even smart for candidates to target women as a voting bloc? MICHAEL DIMOCK: It's as least as diverse a group as men are, and we don't really talk about the men's vote in the same way we talk about the women's vote. LUDDEN: Pollster Michael Dimock of the Pew Research Center says, yes, many women do care more than men about abortion. But far from uniting them, it's an issue that divides them. As for things like equal pay, workplace equity and flex time... DIMOCK: It's hard to know whether those kinds of particular issues would really outweigh the big issues of this election, which are jobs and the economy and the overall direction of government. LUDDEN: Still, whether women like it or not, the candidates are clearly crafting special messages just for them. Jennifer Ludden, NPR News, Washington.

            "article_content": "One day after the second presidential debate of 2012, President Obama campaigned in Iowa and Ohio. The campaign spent much of Wednesday taking Mitt Romney to task for what some regard as out-of-date comments about women in the workplace.  SCOTT HORSLEY, BYLINE: And I'm Scott Horsley, traveling with President Obama, who's eager to regain the advantage he once enjoyed with women voters. The Obama campaign spent much of yesterday taking Governor Romney to task for what some regard as his out-of-date comments about women in the workplace. Mr. Obama drove the point home last night in front of 14,000 supporters on a college campus in Athens, Ohio. (SOUNDBITE OF SPEECH) PRESIDENT BARACK OBAMA: See, we don't have to order up some binders to find qualified, talented, driven young women to learn and teach and thrive and start businesses. HORSLEY: The president often notes that the first bill he signed into law, the Lilly Ledbetter Act, makes it easier for women to sue if they've been victims of unequal pay. Governor Romney has not said whether he supports that law. Mr. Obama says his two daughters should not be paid less for doing the same job as a man. (SOUNDBITE OF SPEECH) OBAMA: And, by the way, men out there, you don't want your wives paid less than a man for the same job. So this isn't just a women's issue. This is a family issue. It's a middle-class issue. HORSLEY: A woman in the audience named Mary Ann, who didn't want to give her last name, nodded appreciatively. She's a part-time letter carrier in Ohio who bristles at having to deliver anti-Obama flyers. She says she's not impressed by Governor Romney's claim that he recruited women to serve in his Cabinet in Massachusetts. MARY ANN: Yes, he hired women. And I was thinking to myself: Yeah, because he could get them at a lower rate. That was the only reason Mitt Romney hired women. HORSLEY: A Gallup poll released this week found women in swing states have the same concerns that men do about jobs and the economy. But women also listed additional concerns about abortion, health care and equal rights as among the most important to them. Those were also the issues that college student Rachel Cowell cited yesterday when she introduced the president in Mount Vernon, Iowa. (SOUNDBITE OF SPEECH) RACHEL COWELL: As a woman, I'm grateful that he's defending Planned Parenthood, standing up for equal pay for equal work, and ensuring that women's health decisions are made by women, not politicians. HORSLEY: Governor Romney has said he would end federal funding for family planning, and he supported a bill that would allow employers to exclude birth control from workers' health insurance. In Iowa and Ohio, Mr. Obama offered supporters his own highlight reel from Tuesday night's debate. Not surprisingly, he had a rather different take from that of Governor Romney. (SOUNDBITE OF SPEECH) OBAMA: Let's recap what we learned last night. His tax plan doesn't add up. His jobs plan doesn't create jobs. His deficit reduction plan adds to the deficit. So, Iowa, you know, everybody here has heard of the New Deal. You've heard of the fair deal. You've heard of the square deal. Mitt Romney's trying to sell you a sketchy deal. We are not buying it. We know better. HORSLEY: Sketchy deal is a phrase Mr. Obama debuted during the debate to describe Governor Romney's tax plan. The GOP presidential hopeful says by closing tax loopholes, he can offset the cost of a proposed 20 percent rate cut without busting the budget or saddling the middle class with higher costs. But Governor Romney hasn't say which loopholes he'd close. Mr. Obama says that should make voters nervous. (SOUNDBITE OF SPEECH) OBAMA: Here's a tip: Usually, when a politician tells you he's going to wait until after the election to explain a plan to you, they don't have a pleasant surprise in store for you. HORSLEY: The nonpartisan Tax Policy Center issued an updated report yesterday, saying Romney's newest proposal to limit itemized deductions would recover only about a third of the cost of his tax cuts or less.

GOP presidential candidate Mitt Romney has been firmly anti-abortion during this campaign. But during Tuesday's debate on Long Island, N.Y., Romney charged that President Obama misrepresented his position on birth control. Here's what Obama said, during what began as a discussion of pay equity for women: \"When Gov. Romney says that we should eliminate funding for Planned Parenthood, there are millions of women all across the country who rely on Planned Parenthood for, not just contraceptive care, they rely on it for mammograms, for cervical cancer screenings. That's a pocketbook issue for women and families all across the country.\" Romney didn't directly address the Planned Parenthood issue \u2014 though he has said repeatedly he wants it defunded. But he did complain about what Obama seemed to be implying. \"I don't believe that bureaucrats in Washington should tell someone whether they can use contraceptives or not, and I don't believe employers should tell someone whether they could have contraceptive care or not. Every woman in America should have access to contraceptives. And \u2014 and the \u2014 and the president's statement of my policy is completely and totally wrong.\" Obama has used both birth control and abortion as wedge issues for months, in an effort to woo female voters. And he has been leading with women. In fact, a new Gallup poll of voters in a dozen swing states found that abortion is the top concern for women, vastly outperforming jobs, health care and the economy. But it's a balancing act for both candidates because Obama's requirement that most health insurance plans pay for contraceptive coverage is unpopular with the Catholic Church \u2014 and so with some Catholic voters in those swing states. Romney, on the other hand, is strongly with the church and against the birth-control mandate, along with his proposal to defund Planned Parenthood. He actually got in trouble earlier in the spring when he initially suggested he would not support a Senate amendment to overturn the birth control requirement. But birth control is popular, as is Planned Parenthood, which gets some 40 percent of its funding from federal and state governments. So now Romney is out with a new ad. \"You know, those ads saying Mitt Romney would ban all abortions and contraception seemed a bit extreme, so I looked into it,\" says a woman identified as Sarah Minto. \"Turns out Romney doesn't oppose contraception at all. In fact, he thinks abortion should be an option in cases of rape, incest, or to save a mother's life.\" The ad is not that surprising given that recent polls show a narrowing of the gender gap, with Romney catching up with women. But women's health groups are not amused. \"This is an ad designed to deceive women,\" said Planned Parenthood Action Fund Executive Vice President Dawn Laguens. \"The Romney team knows that Mitt Romney's real agenda for women's health is deeply unpopular \u2014 ending safe and legal abortion, ending Planned Parenthood's preventive care that millions of people rely on, and repealing the Affordable Care Act and the coverage of birth control with no copay.\" Romney spokeswoman Andrea Saul denied that there is anything misleading in the ad. \"The disagreement between the Governor and President Obama on this issue is over whether the federal government should impose a nationwide insurance mandate for contraception,\" she said in an email. \"The President wants bureaucrats to make that decision for all Americans, even where it violates their religious liberty. Governor Romney does not.\"",

The two men differed over economic policy, immigration, gun control and essentially every subject that was brought up in questions from members of the audience at Hofstra University. A rare moment of accord came when they discussed the importance of education. Obama clearly sought to regain the advantage he had enjoyed among women, frequently invoking Planned Parenthood and contraception. Romney said that as governor of Massachusetts he had made every effort to hire women, noting he'd gathered \"whole binders full of women.\" All in all, the debate may not have reshaped the race, but it served to underscore the starkly different approaches the two major party candidates would take to address the nation's problems. How Obama Got His Groove Back Obama had been widely criticized for his desultory and politically disastrous performance in the first debate, back on Oct. 3, which appears to have cost him his lead in the national polls. He came prepared for this fight, ready to defend his record and to put the knock on Romney at every opportunity. Obama remained focused, leaning forward eagerly in his chair while waiting for his turn to speak, and giving no quarter when it was his time to stand up and deliver. His mantra in response to many of Romney's remarks was to say, \"It just isn't true.\" After failing to do so in the first debate, Obama attacked his challenger about his career as an outsourcer of jobs and chided him for his infamous remarks about 47 percent of Americans believing themselves to be victims. Romney tried to fend off Obama's complaints at one point by suggesting that Obama check the investments his own pension fund makes to see if he doesn't also hold investments in Chinese companies. \"I don't look at my pension,\" Obama said with a shrug. \"It's not as big as yours.\" Romney Highlighted All The President's Perceived Failures But if every political junkie in the land knew that Obama would want to go on offense, Romney himself gave no quarter. He complained that the president had mischaracterized his record and rhetoric on issues such as tax policy. For the most part, though, Romney concerned himself with pointing out Obama's failures. About two-thirds of the way through the debate, he launched into a litany of problems on the president's watch \u2014 persistently high unemployment, trillion-dollar deficits, the failure to reform entitlements, the lack of a plan to address illegal immigration and an increase in poverty and the number of people receiving food stamps. \"The middle class is getting crushed under the policies of a president who has not understood what it takes to get the economy working again,\" Romney said. \"The policies he's put in place, from Obamacare to Dodd-Frank to his tax policies to his regulatory policies \u2014 these policies combined have not let this economy take off and grow like it could have.\" Many Voters Are Not Just Undecided But Unhappy Several of the questions asked by the undecided voters in the Hofstra audience amounted to bread-and-butter rephrasings of larger campaign themes, such as the state of the economy. One man wanted lower gas prices, while a college student was nervous about finding a job after graduation. But some of the questioners made their unhappiness with the candidates quite clear. One of them, Michael Jones, told Obama that while he had voted for him back in 2008, \"I'm not as optimistic as I was in 2012. Most things I need for everyday living are very expensive.\" \"We've gone through a tough four years, there's no doubt about it,\" Obama conceded, before offering a litany of achievements he's proud of, such as cutting taxes and killing Osama bin Laden. The Candidates Argued Ceaselessly Over The Past Former presidents George W. Bush and Ronald Reagan both figured prominently in the debate. Romney was confronted by a question from Susan Katz, who said she attributes \"much of America's economic and international problems to the failings and missteps of the Bush administration.\" She challenged Romney to explain how he would avoid a repeat of the Bush presidency. Romney sought to turn the question into an opportunity, suggesting he held several differences with his fellow Republican, promising to do a better job in promoting trade and small businesses and confronting China than President Bush did. Obama was having none of it. He put his own predecessor in a more flattering light than Romney, arguing that Bush had pursued superior policies when it came to Medicare and immigration. Romney also said his opponent suffered by comparison with a Republican president, saying Reagan had created more jobs following a deep recession than Obama has. Obama offered one final blast from the past, brushing off a line from Bush's re-election campaign. \"I think Gov. Romney was for an assault weapons ban before he was against it,\" Obama said, echoing a comment that haunted Massachusetts Sen. John Kerry \u2014 Obama's debate prep sparring partner \u2014 in his 2004 race against Bush. The Debate On Foreign Policy Is Well And Truly Teed Up Foreign policy will be the subject of the final presidential debate next Monday. It was little discussed at Hofstra, but the subject still provided perhaps the most heated moment of the town hall debate. In recent weeks, Romney has frequently criticized Obama for the events last month at the U.S. Consulate in Benghazi, Libya, that ended with the death of four Americans, including Ambassador Chris Stevens. During the debate, Romney said the administration's response to events had been confused for days, with various officials either characterizing them incorrectly or disturbingly failing to understand properly what had happened. He said the incident \"calls into question the president's whole policy in the Middle East,\" arguing that things were out of hand not just in Libya but in Syria and Egypt as well. Obama took full responsibility for what happened in Benghazi, but he also took offense at Romney's suggestion that he had neglected the crisis in favor of campaigning. The president's remarks were peppered with anger and conviction as he described his task in greeting the caskets when they returned home. But he also sought to score points with humor. After Romney questioned Obama's claim to have described the Benghazi killings as an \"act of terror\" in the Rose Garden the day after they occurred, moderator Candy Crowley of CNN backed up the president's account. \"Can you say that a little louder, Candy?\" Obama asked, triggering a rare moment of laughter.",

            "article_content": "In a town hall-style debate that saw the candidates constantly challenge each other on issues ranging from the economy to the handling of the Sept. 11 attack on the U.S. Consulate in Benghazi, Libya, President Obama and GOP challenger Mitt Romney got up close and personal at times Tuesday night. Through the evening, we'll watch for ALERTs: \"A Line Everybody [will] Remember Tomorrow.\" The president, who was criticized for being too passive during the contenders' first debate two weeks ago in Denver, was much more aggressive about challenging claims made by Romney. He interrupted the former Massachusetts governor when the challenger said things the president claimed were false, and he exhibited a flash of anger about things Romney said regarding the Benghazi attack and its aftermath. \"The suggestion that anybody on my team ... would play politics or mislead when we've lost four of our own, governor, is offensive,\" a grim-faced Obama told Romney. \"That's not what we do. ... That's not what I do as president.\" Romney, meanwhile, did not shy away from making his case that the president has failed to live up to the promises he made four years ago and that the country is no better off \u2014 and in some ways is worse off \u2014 since Obama moved into the Oval Office. \"If you were to elect President Obama, you know what you're going to get,\" Romney told one questioner, \"a repeat of the last four years. ... This is a president who's not been able to do what he said he would do.\" At times the two came close enough to touch each other \u2014 though they did not \u2014 as they invaded each other's personal space and fired off attack lines. We live blogged as they took questions from audience members . The 82 people selected to be part of the group that got to ask questions have said they aren't committed to either candidate. CNN's Candy Crowley was the moderator. Update at 10:45 p.m. ET. Last Question. Tell Us About Yourselves: The last question to each man aims to get him to talk about himself and to discuss what people don't know about him. Romney says the Obama campaign has spent considerable time attacking him and that voters should know, \"I care about 100 percent of the American people.\" And he ends this last response by recapping some of the failures of the Obama administration, including \"47 million people on food stamps ... and 50 percent of kids coming out of college not being able to find work.\" Obama talks as much about Romney as about himself. \"When he said behind closed doors that 47 percent of the country consider themselves victims ... think about who he's talking about,\" Obama says, including \"folks on Social Security ... veterans ... students.\" \"I want to fight for them,\" Obama says of those people. Update at 10:30 p.m. ET. Flash Of Anger From Obama; Romney Says It Took 14 Days For Obama To Call Benghazi Attack An Act Of Terror; Crowley Corrects The GOP Nominee: Romney criticizes Obama for the president's handling of the Sept. 11 attack on the U.S. Consulate in Benghazi, Libya, and in particular for going to political fundraisers in the days immediately after. He also questions why the administration at first tried to blame the attack on protests over an anti-Muslim video, when it had information indicating it was a planned assault by terrorists. Obama shows his first flash of anger. \"The suggestion that anybody on my team ... would play politics or mislead when we've lost four of our own, governor, is offensive,\" he says. \"That's not what we do. ... That's not what I do as president.\" Romney says that it took the president 14 days to come forward and \"call it an act of terror.\" Obama is quick to respond, saying he called it an act of terror the day after the attack \u2014 during a statement he made in the Rose Garden. Romney insists that didn't happen. And then Crowley gets some applause from the onlookers (not the town hall participants) when she corrects Romney. \"He did call it an act of terror,\" she tells the GOP nominee, who appears surprised. A check of the transcript shows that during his five-minute statement, Obama said: \"No acts of terror will ever shake the resolve of this great nation, alter that character, or eclipse the light of the values that we stand for. Today we mourn four more Americans who represent the very best of the United States of America. We will not waver in our commitment to see that justice is done for this terrible act. And make no mistake, justice will be done.\" Update at 10:10 p.m. ET. Getting Close And Personal Again: At the end of a discussion on immigration policy, Romney pivots to change the subject to something Obama said earlier \u2014 that Romney has invested in companies that shift jobs to China. It was done by his blind trust, Romney says, and he asks Obama whether he's looked at his own pension fund because it too has invested in China. No, Obama says as the two men come close again, because \"it's not as big as yours.\" Update at 10:05 p.m. ET. Sharp Differences On Obama's Record: Obama is asked what he's done to earn anyone's vote in 2012. The president runs through some things, including the killing of Osama bin Laden, the creation of 5 million private jobs in the past 30 months, and legislation aimed at cracking down on Wall Street's excesses. \"Does that mean you're not struggling? Absolutely not,\" Obama says. But, the commitments he hasn't been able to keep, says the president, are \"not for lack of trying\" and he will work on them in a second term. Then Obama pivots to talk about the promises he says Romney would keep. When Republicans pledged to not raise taxes on the rich, Romney said \"me too,\" Obama says. On cutting funding for Planned Parenthood, Romney said \"me too.\" And on repealing Obamacare, Romney said \"me too.\" \"I think you know better,\" Romney tells the questioner. \"If you were to elect President Obama, you know what you're going to get ... a repeat of the last four years. ... This is a president who's not been able to do what he said he would do.\" Update at 9:52 p.m. ET. How Is Romney Different From Bush? Audience member Susan says she is an undecided voter because she's been disappointed in the lack of progress in the past four years. But she also attributes \"much of the lack of progress to the failings and missteps of the Bush administration.\" How is Romney different from Bush? Romney says, \"I'll crack down on China ... President Bush didn't. ... I'm also going to dramatically expand trade in Latin America.\" And he'll \"get us to a balanced budget.\" To which Obama responds that Romney's economic policies would be little different from Bush's. Update at 9:40 p.m. ET. \"Sketchy Deal\" Vs. \"Road To Greece\": Obama walks toward Romney and says that the governor wants $5 trillion in tax cuts, $2 trillion in additional defense spending that the Pentagon isn't asking for, and to extend the Bush-era tax cuts at a cost of $1 trillion. But Romney \"can't tell you\" how he'll pay for all that, Obama says to the audience. Then, to Romney, he says that in the business world \"you wouldn't have taken such a sketchy deal.\" Which leads to Romney talking about the $4 trillion in deficits accumulated while Obama has been president. Obama's policies, Romney says, \"puts us on the road to Greece.\" \"Sketchy deal\" and \"road to Greece\": Two ALERTs (\"a line everybody [will] remember tomorrow\")? Update at 9:30 p.m. ET. No Looking Down By Obama: After the first debate, the president was criticized for often looking down \u2014 and at times not even looking that interested \u2014 as Romney spoke. Tonight, he's keeping his head up and his eyes on his opponent when the Republican nominee speaks. It will be interesting to watch what's said in the post-debate analyses about the president's demeanor. Update at 9:25 p.m ET. Invading Each Other's Personal Space, Generating Heat: There's much more heat in tonight's debate than in the first Obama-Romney encounter, in large part because the two men are walking toward each other as they trade verbal jabs. They're getting inside each other's personal space. Moments ago, Romney insisted that oil and natural gas drilling on public lands \"is down.\" That's \"just not true,\" said Obama, as the two men came within just a few feet of each other. \"It's absolutely true,\" Romney responded. And as Romney continued to speak, Obama tried to interrupt. \"You'll get your chance in a moment,\" Romney said to the president. \"That wasn't a question, that was a statement.\" \"You'll get your chance in a moment\" could be tonight's first ALERT (\"a line everybody [will] remember tomorrow\"). Update at 9:15 p.m. ET. Right At The Start, Tough Exchanges On Jobs, Taxes: The first question comes from Jeremy, a 20-year-old college student who says all he hears is that he has little chance of finding a job when he graduates. Romney walks straight toward the young man and says, \"Your question is one being asked by college kids all over this country.\" He assures Jeremy that \"I know how to create jobs\" and uses his response to talk about how \"the middle class has been crushed for the past four years\" \u2014 during Obama's term in office. The president walks over to Jeremy and tells him \"your future is bright.\" Then he pivots to contrast \"the 5 million jobs we've created in the past 30 months in the private sector alone\" to what he says was Romney's willingness to \"let Detroit go bankrupt.\" Which gets Romney to respond that \"my plan was to have the company go through bankruptcy ... and come out stronger.\" \"You took Detroit bankrupt,\" Romney tells Obama. Obama then says that \"what Gov. Romney said just isn't true. He wanted to take them into bankruptcy without providing any way to stay open.\" Romney's philosophy, says Obama, is to cut taxes for the wealthy and let companies shift jobs overseas. \"We have fought back for four years to get out of that [kind of] mess,\" the president continues. \"The last thing we need to do\" is go back to those policies. Update at 8:55 p.m. ET. The Show's About To Start: Crowley just gave the 80 members of the town hall audience their last pep talk \u2014 and advised the several hundred others in the hall who are watching from \"the cheap seats\" to make sure their cellphones are turned off. So the debate is about to get going. Update at 8:40 p.m. ET. It May Be \"Harder To Dodge\" The Questions: NPR's Don Gonyea tweets from Hofstra that because of the town hall format, it may be \"harder to dodge\" a question since it's being asked \"by a real voter.\" Update at 8:30 p.m. ET. The Polls: Just how tight is the race right now? Real Clear Politics collects poll results and comes up with an RCP Average. It is now showing Romney at 47.4 percent; Obama at 47 percent. Of course, those polls are asking which candidate you would vote for \"if the election was held today.\" There are three weeks to go to Election Day. Update at 8:17 p.m. ET. Debate Might \"Run Over A Bit:\" The campaigns have told news outlets to expect that the debate, scheduled to last 90 minutes, might run about 10 minutes long, C-SPAN reports. Update at 8:12 p.m. ET. Crowley On What Makes For A Good Question: \"Something that reveals new ground,\" she says in an interview C-SPAN just broadcast (and streamed here). Update at 8 p.m. ET. Obama Needs A Bounce; Romney Needs To Show Empathy: As for what's at stake, NPR Senior Washington Editor Ron Elving says that for the president this debate is his \"best opportunity ... to make up for \u2014 or bounce back from \u2014 his performance in the first debate on Oct. 3, which cost him the [campaign] momentum.\" For Romney, Ron says, \"it's more about the relationship he has with these questioners. ... He's going to have to show the kind of empathy and human warmth that people look for in a president.\" Update at 7:45 p.m. ET. Who's There? Who Gets To Ask Questions? What's The Format? According to The Associated Press, the Gallup polling organization helped identify and pick the 82 \"uncommitted voters\" who will be onstage with the candidates. Crowley, AP says, has been working with the group to select \"as broad a range of questions as possible.\" NPR's Don Gonyea says it is hoped about 20 people will be able to pose their questions. If Crowley \"is inclined to follow up on any of those questions,\" he says, \"she certainly can be expected to do so. That's something the campaigns had pushed back against.\" But Crowley and the Debate Commission insisted that she has the right to interject if necessary to help guide the discussion. \"We can assume the bulk of the questions will be about domestic policy and the economy,\" Don tells our Newscast Desk. There will be no formal opening or closing statements. Romney gets the first question. Obama gets the last word. They're supposed to keep their responses to 2 minutes or less. Update at 7:30 p.m. ET. The Story So Far: The first Obama-Romney debate, on Oct. 3 at the University of Denver, shook up the campaign. Romney had what polls show was a strong performance, while Obama was judged to have \"lost\" the faceoff. Since then, Vice President Biden and Republican vice presidential nominee Rep. Paul Ryan had their one and only debate. Biden was aggressive. Ryan, polls indicate, held his own. The third and final presidential debate is set for next Monday night (Oct. 22) at Lynn University in Boca Raton, Fla.",

Catholic voters are an important constituency in the battleground state of Ohio, where they represent about one-fourth of voters. They went for President Bush in 2004, but for candidate Barack Obama in 2008. This year, for the first time, they'll be choosing between two tickets that both feature a practicing Catholic. During last week's debate, GOP vice presidential candidate Paul Ryan spoke about his faith this way: \"I don't see how a person can separate their public life from their private life or from their faith. Our faith informs us in everything we do. My faith informs me about how to take care of the vulnerable, about how to make sure that people have a chance in life.\" His Democratic counterpart and fellow Catholic, Vice President Joe Biden, said his religion defines him. \"I've been a practicing Catholic my whole life. And it has particularly informed my social doctrine. Catholic social doctrine talks about taking care of those ... who can't take care of themselves.\" Ryan stressed the church's teaching on life issues, such as abortion, while Biden stressed the social justice part of Catholic doctrine. Vincent Miller, who teaches religion and theology at the University of Dayton in Ohio, says Biden and Ryan represent the two great themes in Catholics' politics. \"They care about life issues especially,\" he says. \"Catholics also ... think in terms of community, and they think in terms of government having responsibility for community.\" Miller says different issues bring out different Catholic voters. For instance, in 2004, there was a gay marriage amendment on the ballot. \"And there was very little people could do to affect their rather desperate situation on the economy, so votes gravitated toward that action that would let them do something,\" he says. \"In this election, changes to Medicare are a real issue. The same communitarian \u2014 the same common good imagination that pushes them another way this time.\" The division among Catholics can be seen at events held by a group called Nuns on the Bus. The nuns have been active and outspoken \u2014 and often at odds with the church's male-dominated hierarchy. This fall, they're traveling around Ohio, calling attention to issues such as poverty. Kathy Trangenstein of Oakwood, Ohio, came to see the Nuns on the Bus at a rally at the University of Dayton. She says she's still on fence about the election. \"I've always voted straight Republican,\" she says. \"But now I see what's going on, and I'm afraid all the help is going to be cut off if the Republican ticket wins.\" Meanwhile, Ellen Merkel of Centerville, Ohio, says abortion remains the key issue for her. \"The issue of life, we talk about it ... even the Republicans kind of give it lip service \u2014 but I'll support someone who at least gives me lip service more than I will on someone who says, 'I'm gonna double down on Planned Parenthood,' \" she says. Also on hand at the Dayton rally was Dottie Klein. She says she used to be a Goldwater Republican but now plans to vote for Obama, because she's looking for a different emphasis \u2014 \"an emphasis on the poor.\" \"I think we need to help one another,\" she says. \"I think that immigration is another thing \u2014 I think we're looking for scapegoats.\" When the Nuns on the Bus reached Columbus, Greg Sutton was in the crowd. Sutton is an example of a Catholic voter moving away from the president. \"I did vote for this president, yes. I think actually it was the health care \u2014 the imposition of ... I don't like calling it Obamacare, but I don't know what else to call it,\" he says. \"I think Obamacare started it, and then I became more disillusioned with the president.\" Polls show the president fighting to defend a slim lead among Catholics in Ohio \u2014 a margin crucial to his fortunes in the state. The party that wins the Catholic vote in Ohio usually wins the state \u2014 and the winner in Ohio nearly always wins the election.",

            "article_content": "Mitt Romney's comments on abortion have surprised those on both sides of the issue.\n                \n                    \n                    Evan Vucci/AP\n                    \n                \nhide caption Mitt Romney's comments on abortion have surprised those on both sides of the issue. Just how many abortion positions does Mitt Romney have? Once again, that answer is unclear. This time the confusion began Tuesday, during a meeting with the editorial board of the Des Moines Register. \"There's no legislation with regards to abortion that I'm familiar with that would become part of my agenda,\" Romney said. He went on to add that he would use an executive order to reinstate the \"Mexico City Policy,\" which bars U.S. aid to international groups that lobby or pay for abortions. But the comment about not pushing abortion-restricting legislation surprised those on both sides of the abortion debate. \"That's quite a shock, coming from Mitt Romney, who has consistently called for the overturn of Roe v Wade; who said that he would appoint Supreme Court justices who would do just that; who has an extensive pro-life agenda on his website that anybody can access,\" says Beth Shipp, political director of NARAL Pro-Choice America. That agenda includes things like defunding Planned Parenthood, which would require legislation. Romney has also endorsed legislation to ban abortions at the point fetuses can theoretically feel pain. In addition to a terse statement from the campaign vowing that, if elected, Romney would \"be a pro-life president,\" the candidate himself tried to walk back some of his comments when asked by reporters at a campaign stop Wednesday. \"I think I've said time and again, I'm a pro-life candidate. I'll be a pro-life president,\" he said during a rope line in Ohio. Even before Romney's walk back, however, he was being defended, if somewhat weakly, by abortion opponents. \"No one likes to be caught flat-footed or see your hero flat-footed. But those moments do come,\" said Marjorie Dannenfelser, president of the Susan B. Anthony List. Dannenfelser said she thinks Romney's comment to the editorial board was nothing more than a slip \u2014 that he just has too much else on his mind to keep issues like abortion front and center. \"I think the simple truth of the matter is his head is in jobs and the economy almost all day long, almost every single day,\" she said. \"And of course we want at least a third of his focus to be on it all the time, but you don't always get everything that you want.\" NARAL's Shipp, however, thinks it's anything but an accident \u2014 just as it was no accident when Romney said in a CBS evening news interview in August that he supported abortions when the pregnant woman's health \u2014 not just her life \u2014 was threatened. That position was also reversed later, quietly, by staff. \"I know Mitt Romney really wants women to vote for him,\" Shipp says. But the way that he's going about this, by lying to people about where he stands on the issues, is not going to serve him well come Nov. 6.\" Still, political scientist John Green of the University of Akron says what Romney is doing isn't all that unusual. \"There's a long tradition of candidates adopting one kind of position for a broad audience, maybe on television, then having a different position in direct mail or in smaller venues,\" he says. Green says Romney is running into trouble because in today's world of Twitter and nonstop cable news, there's no such thing as being able to deliver different messages to anyone anymore. \"We've discovered over the last couple of election cycles, and we've seen it in many examples this year, is that it's hard to keep those different venues separate because of our communication technology today,\" Green says. With an issue as touchy as abortion, that can become even more hazardous, says Green. \"The people who really care about something like abortion, whether they're in the Republican base or the Democratic base, have very firm convictions on where a candidate should stand,\" he says. \"And variation on those convictions can create very real problems.\" Those problems include both alienating one's own voters, and mobilizing those on the other side. At least for now, however, Romney seems to be making it work. There's still nearly a month until Election Day, however, and two more debates to go.",

            "article_content": "Joe Biden: Biden, whose own presidential aspirations sputtered in 1988 and again in 2008, brought to the Democratic ticket foreign policy chops and an ability to relate to working-class voters. In his 36 years representing Delaware in the U.S. Senate, he became known as more pragmatist than ideologue. He has also made a somewhat dubious name for himself because of his volubility and not infrequent verbal stumbles. But he has parlayed those potential liabilities into an effective, if occasionally unpredictable, campaign trail presence. Paul Ryan: Ryan, the Wisconsin native picked by GOP presidential candidate Mitt Romney as his running mate, brings conservative star power to the ticket. One of the self-named \"Young Guns\" of the U.S. House, Ryan is best known for congressional budgets he has authored. His proposals would overhaul the tax code, increase defense spending, defund much of President Obama's health care legislation and remake Medicare into a voucherlike program. His prominence in the size-of-government debate has reassured conservatives skeptical of Romney's bona fides and also given Democrats an opportunity to portray the ticket as unfriendly to Americans of modest or little means. Biden: 69; born Joseph Robinette Biden Jr, in Scranton, Pa. Ryan: 42; born Paul Davis Ryan, in Janesville, Wis. Biden: Abortion: Supports legal abortion under Roe v. Wade; supports partial-birth abortion ban; has voted to expand research to more embryonic stem cell lines. Ryan: Abortion: Opposes abortion and embryonic stem cell research; supports prohibitions on federal funding for abortion and would ban federal funding of Planned Parenthood. Biden: Civil Rights: Supports gay marriage, which he once opposed; supported repeal of Don't Ask, Don't Tell law; supports prohibition on job discrimination based on sexual orientation. Ryan: Civil Rights: Opposed repeal of Don't Ask Don't Tell law barring openly gay Americans from serving in the military; opposes adoptions by same-sex couples; supports constitutional amendment to bar same-sex marriage; supports prohibition on job discrimination based on sexual orientation. Biden: Health Care: Advocate for Obama's health care overhaul, which he once advised the president to delay given harsh economic conditions. Ryan: Health Care: Opposes Obamacare; wrote budget plan that secures savings by converting Medicare from a guaranteed benefits to a voucher plan, and Medicaid to a state block grant program tied to inflation. Biden: Taxes: Has, with President Obama, advocated raising taxes on wealthy Americans; touts tax cuts the administration says has lowered middle class tax bills by an average $3,600. Ryan: Taxes: Has supported a two-level flat tax, reducing the corporate tax rate and eliminating the alternative minimum tax. Advocates closing unspecified loopholes to pay for tax reductions. Biden: Spouse, Jill Biden, college professor; children, Beau, Hunter and Naomi Biden (with late wife, Neilia Hunter), and Ashley (with Jill Biden). Ryan: Spouse, Janna Ryan, tax lawyer and stay-at-home mother; children, Elizabeth, Charles and Samuel. Education Biden: Law degree, Syracuse University, 1968; bachelor's, University of Delaware, 1965. Ryan: Bachelor's degrees in political science and economics, Miami University of Ohio, 1992. Religion Biden: Roman Catholic Ryan: Roman Catholic Wealth Biden: Biden's reported personal net worth, according to financial disclosures required of members of the executive branch, ranges from negative $1.2 million to positive $190,993. He has assets ranging from $233,000 to $776,000, but his liabilities include a mortgage of between $500,000 and $1 million, which includes his principal residence and a rental property, and several loans or lines of credit. Ryan: Ryan's personal worth ranges from $2 million to $7.7 million, largely as a result of an inheritance his wife recently received after her mother died. In June, Ryan amended his 2011 personal financial disclosure to reflect his wife's one-third interest in her late mother's trust. Her share in the blind trust is valued between $1 million and $5 million, according to the amendment submitted by Ryan. His only liability is a mortgage of between $250,000 and $500,000. Health Biden: Life-threatening brain aneurysm that required surgery in 1988, after which he suffered a pulmonary embolism. He was given last rites by a priest. A second aneurysm was repaired that year; he has reportedly had no recurrences. Ryan: Touts his fitness and low body fat as the result of a strenuous daily workout that combines strength and cardio training. Personal Setback Biden: His wife and 1-year-old daughter were killed and both sons injured in a 1972 car crash shortly after his first election to the U.S. Senate. They were Christmas tree shopping; Biden was not in the car. Democratic leaders persuaded him not to resign his seat to care for his family. He was sworn in at his sons' hospital bedside. The devastating loss, he wrote in his book, Promises to Keep, filled him with rage and made him question his faith. \"All my life, I'd been taught about our benevolent God. ... Well, I didn't want to hear anything about a merciful God. ... I felt God had played a horrible trick on me, and I was angry.\" Ryan: When he was 16, Ryan, the youngest of four children, found his 55-year-old father dead in bed of a heart attack. He has pointed to the early death of his father, a lawyer, as key to the formation of his political and personal tenets. His father's Social Security survivor benefits helped put him through college. Politics Experience Biden: U.S. senator from Delaware, 1973-2009 (Judiciary Committee chairman, 1987-1995; Foreign Relations Committee chairman, 2007-2009); New Castle, Del., County Council, 1970-1972; attorney and public defender, Wilmington, Del., 1969-1972. Ryan: U.S. representative from Wisconsin's 1st Congressional District since 1999 (House Budget Committee chairman since 2011); legislative director for GOP Sen. Sam Brownback of Kansas, 1995-1997; speechwriter and volunteer for the conservative think tank Empower America; congressional aide to GOP Sen. Bob Kasten of Wisconsin, 1992. Political Setback Biden: His run for the 1988 Democratic presidential nomination was destroyed by allegations of plagiarism when operatives for opponent Michael Dukakis sent media an attack video showing that Biden appropriated without credit parts of a stump speech from British Labour Party leader Neil Kinnock. Ryan: The failure of his ongoing efforts to privatize Social Security, starting in 2005 when he enlisted President George W. Bush to advocate for the change. Republicans lost big in midterm elections the following year. Gaffes Biden: Difficult to pick just a few, from a man who has inspired headlines like this, from The Daily Beast: \"The Never-Ending List of Vice President Joe Biden's Verbal Gaffes.\" -- \"How can they can justify raising taxes on the middle class that's been buried the last four years, how in Lord's name can they justify raising their taxes with these tax cuts?\" \u2014 Oct. 2, 2012, North Carolina campaign speech -- This is a big *bleeping* deal. -- to President Obama, at 2009 signing of health care legislation, caught on a hot microphone. \u2014 I mean, you got the first sorta mainstream African-American who is articulate and bright and clean and a nice-looking guy. I mean, that's a storybook, man. -- interview with New York Observer during 2007 Democratic primary season. Ryan: \"I don't have the \u2014 it would take me too long to go through all of the math.\" - Sept. 30, 2012, Fox News, when pressed to explain the Romney/Ryan budget plan. Fun Facts Biden: -- His sister, Valerie Biden Owens, who ran his first campaign for County Council, has been with him on every campaign since \u2014 including his first Senate race when his upset victory made him, at 29, the fifth-youngest person ever elected to the chamber. \u2014 Overcame a stutter as a child by memorizing poetry and practicing in front of a mirror. \u2014 Amtrak renamed its station in Wilmington, Del., the \"Joseph R. Biden Jr. Railroad Station\" to honor the man who during his 36 years in the Senate commuted by train almost daily from his Delaware home to work in Washington. Biden also helped secure stimulus funding to refurbish the station. Ryan: -- Classmates voted him both prom king and biggest \"brown-noser\" his senior year in high school. \u2014 In college, he had a job driving Oscar Mayer's promotional hot dog-shaped Wienermobile. \u2014 His wife's uncle is former senator and Oklahoma Gov. David Boren, a Democrat; her first cousin is the former governor's son, Rep. David Boren, also an Oklahoma Democrat. \u2014 He sleeps in his congressional office while in Washington. \u2014 He has professed a fondness for \"noodling\" \u2014 catching catfish with his bare hands. Vice President Biden and the Republican hoping to replace him, Rep. Paul Ryan of Wisconsin, are scheduled to debate only once, Thursday in Danville, Ky. But they'll be fixtures on the campaign trail until the Nov. 6 election. Here's a side-by-side look at the two men. His sister, Valerie Biden Owens, who ran his first campaign for County Council, has been with him on every campaign since \u2014 including his first Senate race when his upset victory made him, at 29, the fifth-youngest person ever elected to the chamber.

            "article_content": "Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney and his wife, Ann, at the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints in Wolfeboro, N.H. The candidate regularly attends church, but he rarely invokes religion on the campaign trail.\n                \n                    \n                    Evan Vucci/AP\n                    \n                \nhide caption Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney and his wife, Ann, at the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints in Wolfeboro, N.H. The candidate regularly attends church, but he rarely invokes religion on the campaign trail. Religion used to be everywhere in the presidential elections. George W. Bush courted conservative believers in 2004. In 2008, Sarah Palin excited evangelicals and \u2014 unexpectedly \u2014 so did Barack Obama. What a difference a few years make. In 2007, then-candidate Obama used evangelical language to describe his Christian conversion: He was a young, secular community organizer who occasionally visited the local Chicago church, when one day he walked to the front of the sanctuary and knelt before the cross. \"I felt I heard God's spirit beckoning me,\" Obama recalled. \"I submitted myself to his will and dedicated myself to discovering his truths and carrying out his works.\" The testimony startled and intrigued some evangelicals, like David Gushee, director of Mercer University's Center for Theology and Public Life. But now, Gushee says, Obama's evangelical language has disappeared. \"So instead of, 'I love God, God loves me,' 'Here's a hymn quote' or 'Here's a Bible cite,' it's the Golden Rule. It's the common good. It's concern for the poor,\" Gushee says. A Less Overt Religious Message It's a message even nonbelievers can accept: less emphasis on Obama's Christian faith, and more about how his faith has shaped his values. Earlier this year, the president cited the Golden Rule when explaining why he supports same-sex marriage. And he uses New Testament language to connect his mainline Protestant faith to more secular issues like poverty. \"Let me tell you about values,\" Obama told a group in Burlington, Vt., in March. \"Hard work, personal responsibility, those are values. But looking out for one another, that's a value. The idea that we're all in this together, I am my brother's keeper, I am my sister's keeper, that's a value.\" Four years ago, Gushee says, Obama actively courted moderate believers in a major outreach campaign, convincing them that this was a new kind of Democratic Party. That's not the case today. Sources say that several senior people were invited to head up the campaign but declined, because they felt the Obama administration was not serious about reaching out to believers. Now, the tiny outreach campaign is headed by a 24-year-old. Gushee and other observers say there's a split among Obama advisers. One group is furious about the campaign ignoring the faith vote. \"But then there's another group that appears to believe that religious voters of this type are more trouble than they're worth,\" Gushee says. \"That as soon as you think you've pleased them, they complain about something else. \"And so it seems the energy is shifting to shoring up the base of women voters, and union voters, and other kinds of voters that are a more reliable constituency,\" Gushee says. Indeed, religion is something of a minefield for Obama. Many voters still believe, wrongly, that he is a Muslim. And his advisers are loath to remind people of the controversy that surrounded his former pastor, Jeremiah Wright, who declared, \"God damn America.\" Then-candidate Barack Obama speaks at the First Congregational United Church of Christ in Mason City, Iowa, in 2007. Religious messages were a more prominent part of Obama's first presidential campaign.\n                \n                    \n                    Charlie Neibergall/AP\n                    \n                \nhide caption Then-candidate Barack Obama speaks at the First Congregational United Church of Christ in Mason City, Iowa, in 2007. Religious messages were a more prominent part of Obama's first presidential campaign. But the greatest deterrent of all, says Mark Rozell, a scholar of religion and politics at George Mason University, is President Obama's record over the past four years. Rozell says conservative believers are upset with the president's support of same-sex marriage and his health care mandate that would require some religious groups to provide birth control coverage. \"I think it's quite clear from their standpoint that Obama's policies have not been friendly to their worldview and that they're going to turn out for Mitt Romney,\" Rozell says. A Minefield For Both Candidates As for GOP candidate Mitt Romney, he, too, is noticeably mum about his faith. The Republican National Convention presented an opportunity to introduce himself to the world \u2014 and the faith that has dominated his life. But in his one reference to Mormonism, he played it down, noting that while he attended a Mormon church as a child, \"my friends cared more about what sports teams we followed than what church we went to.\" Shaun Casey, who teaches politics and religion at Wesley Theological Seminary, says there are several reasons for Romney's reluctance to emphasize faith. \"The downside for Romney is, first of all, he's not a natural cultural warrior,\" says Casey, who also advised the Obama campaign in 2008. Second, Casey says, is that every reference to Mormonism \"reminds people in his conservative base that he is a Mormon and he is not an evangelical Christian.\" Romney needs those voters to turn out in record numbers, Casey adds, \"and the fear is there, that those folks are going to stay at home.\" But despite reservations about Mormon theology, evangelicals immediately snapped into line once Romney became the Republican candidate. Robert P. Jones, CEO of Public Religion Research Institute, says that new unity means Romney doesn't have to spend time or money reaching those religious voters. Instead, Jones says, the GOP candidate needs to focus on voters in the middle. \"And when he makes his case more to the middle,\" Jones says, \"I think he has to speak less in overtly religious language than he did earlier on, when he was still struggling to make the case that he was the evangelical's candidate.\" Moreover, Jones says, raising religious issues has not helped Romney. Consider the most potent religion weapon: the administration's birth control mandate. That rule sparked the U.S. Catholic Bishops to launch their \"Fortnight for Freedom\" campaign this summer. Romney tried to capitalize on frustration with the rule in a campaign ad that accused President Obama of using his health care plan to \"declare war on religion, forcing religious institutions to go against their faith.\" But the ad had little traction, pollsters say, in part because Catholics are split about the mandate. If that was Romney's silver bullet, Jones says, it appears to have been a blank. \"We don't see the Catholic support for Romney going up after the Fortnight for Freedom campaign is on the ground,\" he says. \"In fact, we see the opposite.\" Jones' polls show that Romney has seen his 20-point lead among white Catholics \u2014 critical swing voters \u2014 completely disappear. There are a lot of explanations for that \u2014 primarily, that voters are focused on the economy above faith. But Jones and others say the effect is that 2012 election is more like the days before George W. Bush \u2014 when candidates wore religion lightly, not on their sleeves.",

The archbishop has urged followers to assess the presidential candidates for their views on abortion and gay marriage.\n                \n                    \n                    Mel Evans/AP\n                    \n                \nhide caption Archbishop John J. Myers stands outside Cathedral Basilica of the Sacred Heart in Newark, N.J. The archbishop has urged followers to assess the presidential candidates for their views on abortion and gay marriage. Since 1972, every single presidential candidate who has won the popular vote has also won the Catholic vote. But with Catholics making up one in every four voters, pinning down what exactly the Catholic vote is becomes tricky. Catholics no longer reliably vote for any one party, but historically, they have voted Democratic. In 1928, the first Catholic ran for president: Democrat Al Smith lost to Herbert Hoover. Dr. Robert Jones, CEO of the Public Religion Research Institute, told weekends on All Things Considered host Guy Raz that the link between Catholics and Democrats has to do with their position in the workforce. \"Part of it really is this alignment between the labor union movement and Catholics, who were really, up until the '70s, still really concentrated in Catholic enclaves in bigger cities; still working class ... in manufacturing jobs,\" he says. A turning point came in 1972, when Republican Richard Nixon won the popular vote \u2014 and the Catholic vote \u2014 over Democrat George McGovern. Jones says the shift started gradually, with fewer Catholics voting Democrat in prior elections. \"So, we had begun to see kind of a slide. But it's not really until 1972 that we really see this division with Catholics really going Republican or Democrat depending on the election and looking really like the bellwether constituency that really goes with the general population,\" he says. By the early '70s, Catholics had already been in the U.S. for generations. \"By the time we get to 1972, we have nearly a century of Catholic integration,\" Jones says, \"with Catholics having upward mobility in terms of education, in terms of income and, I think importantly, moving out of Catholic enclaves in larger cities like New York and Chicago.\" Now the mere size of the population indicates the unpredictability of its vote, Jones says. \"But I would say there are at least two key Catholic votes in the country, and they divide pretty cleanly by ethnicity,\" he says. \"White, non-Hispanic Catholics, for example, in the last election supported John McCain over Barack Obama. However, if you look at the Latino Catholic vote, nearly three-quarters of the Latino Catholic vote supported President Barack Obama.\" Obama received more Catholic votes in total, with the Latino vote putting him over the edge. In this election, both vice presidential candidates are Catholic. Further complicating their pitches is that many Catholics have different positions than the Church has. Take contraception, Jones says, which the Catholic Church officially opposes even though the majority of Catholics don't have a problem with contraception, according to a Gallup poll. Another example is abortion. Catholic voters are divided on the issue, a 2009 Pew Forum report shows. The same is true for gay marriage, which the majority of Catholics support, according to a Public Religion Research Institute report. President Obama is surging past Romney among Catholics. The latest Pew Poll gives him a 15-point lead among all Catholic voters. That's up from the two-point lead he had in June. While the two candidates are virtually tied among white Catholics, Obama has a strong lead over Romney with both African-American and Hispanic voters overall.",

Chris Murphy at a job fair he sponsored in New Britain, Conn., on Thursday. It might seem counterintuitive, but the man running against Republican Linda McMahon in her second attempt at becoming Connecticut's first female senator wants this race to be all about women. Democratic Rep. Chris Murphy released an ad this week, hammering McMahon's stance on women's health and reminding voters of McMahon's former role as CEO of World Wrestling Entertainment. \"As CEO, Linda McMahon demeaned women to make millions in her business,\" a woman claims in the ad. Another says: \"As senator, McMahon would support a Republican proposal that would allow my employer to deny me coverage for contraception, and she will deny coverage for mammograms, siding with the most extreme Republicans to deny women health care.\" McMahon hit back, calling Murphy's ad \"totally false\" and \"pretty desperate.\" In an ad of her own, she said: \"Chris, take a look: I am a woman, a pro-choice woman. My company offered excellent health benefits that included mammograms and access to birth control. It's absurd to claim I'd vote differently.\" Still, in an interview, McMahon acknowledges she would have voted for a GOP amendment that failed this year in the Senate. It would have blocked the Obama administration's order that health plans in institutions run by religious organizations provide free contraceptives to women. \"I really felt that institutions that were, you know, religious oriented, should be able, you know, not to have to provide contraception,\" McMahon said. Two years ago, McMahon lost by 12 percentage points to Democrat Richard Blumenthal. This year, McMahon and Murphy are competing for the Senate seat being vacated by independent Sen. Joe Lieberman. Yale University political scientist Eleanor Powell says McMahon, using her vast personal fortune and fame, really never stopped running, although this time she's been aggressively courting women. Linda McMahon (center) visits a senior center in Naugatuck, Conn., this month.\n                \n                    \n                    Jessica Hill/AP\n                    \n                \nhide caption Linda McMahon (center) visits a senior center in Naugatuck, Conn., this month. \"She's managed to portray that she's done a lot for Connecticut women and, whereas, Murphy's been, you know, in the House of Representatives taking votes ... with the Democrats, which are sort of more traditionally allied with many women's issues,\" Powell said. \"It's impressive how she's managed to convey this pro-women's agenda.\" Meanwhile, another McMahon TV ad released earlier this month reminds voters that before going to Congress, Murphy missed rent and mortgage payments, and got what the ad portrays as a questionable home equity loan. \"How?\" the ad asks. \"The bank that gave Murphy the loan was also giving him campaign contributions because Murphy sat on the banking committee. Murphy voted for the bank bailout, and Murphy's favorite bank got a $400 million bailout. Connect the dots.\" Murphy, who was a member of the House Committee on Financial Services, rejected those claims at a news conference earlier this week. \"I've made mistakes with my personal finances, but I've paid back what I owed,\" Murphy said. \"Independent analysts who've examined Linda's lies have declared them to be false and out of line.\" Later, in an interview, Murphy says McMahon simply wants to skirt the real issues by raising fake ones. \"Linda McMahon's campaign strategy is to keep this campaign on, on lies about ... me and my family's finances,\" Murphy said. Congressional expert Arthur Paulson of Southern Connecticut State University says that as a Democrat, Murphy should be doing better. \"If you forced me to choose, I would say right now I think Murphy's going to win, but that's what I would've said all along, and I'm surprised we're even in a contest here,\" Paulson said. In a state that hasn't sent a Republican to the Senate in more than three decades, two recent polls have Murphy ahead of McMahon by just a few points.",

A slew of new presidential polls released this week not only confirm a long-established gender gap among voters, but also suggest that the male-female preference divide in this year's presidential contest could hit historic levels. It may surprise that that divide appears not driven by social issues and arguments over reproductive care or choices, analysts say, but largely by the national conversation over the size of government. \"On the fundamental question of whether you want a smaller government with fewer services, or a bigger government with more services, women and men are in a very different place,\" says Carroll Doherty of the Pew Research Center, adding that women are far more supportive of the bigger/more equation. \"And that,\" he says, \"is the fundamental question of this election.\" How women \u2014 and men \u2014 come down on that question is more fundamentally tied to, or \"correlated with,\" how they'll vote Nov. 6 than any issue Pew has found in more than three decades of polling, Doherty says. \"Social issues matter in the gender gap, but the real big dividing lines are what government should be doing for the poor, the elderly and the size of safety net,\" Doherty says. That suggests that Romney's comments in a secretly recorded fundraiser \u2014 when he characterized \"47 percent\" of Americans as perceiving themselves as victims entitled to government support \u2014 have the potential to resonate widely in the presidential race. And that Romney's failure to gain traction against Obama in national polls will ultimately have more to do with the size-of-government argument than any specific position the GOP has taken on the \"women's issues\" of abortion or birth control. \"There's very little gender gap on abortion,\" Doherty says. A Look At The Numbers Nationally, women likely to vote said they preferred Obama over Romney by a nearly 20-point margin, according to a Pew Research Center poll taken earlier this month and before the \"47 percent\" comments. Social issues matter in the gender gap, but the real big dividing lines are what government should be doing for the poor, the elderly and the size of safety net. Carroll Doherty, Pew Research Center Swing state poll results released this week suggest similar margins in Florida and Pennsylvania. An even wider margin was found by a Quinnipiac/CBS News/New York Times survey in Ohio, where 60 percent of likely female voters said they prefer Obama, and 35 percent picked Romney as their candidate. Obama won the women's vote nationally by 13 points in 2008. It's worth noting that female voters, as a group, haven't always preferred the Democratic candidate for president. But you'd have to reach back to 1980 and 1984 to find elections when a majority of women voted for the Republican candidate, choosing Ronald Reagan over Democratic candidates Jimmy Carter and Walter Mondale. Still, even in those years, more women than men marked their ballots for the Democrats. And the gender gap, while varying in its size, has remained a constant. In 2004, President George W. Bush, in his successful re-election run, enjoyed a big lead among men and only lost women overall by 3 percentage points. Obama's strength with women is driven by those who are younger and single, but he is also outpolling Romney with married women overall by about 10 percentage points, according to Pew, and with married white women by a few percentage points. And while Romney has consistently been favored by white married men, who drive his large lead over Obama with married men, he has been losing his edge with unmarried men. GOP's White Flag? After the Democrats were crushed in the 2010 midterm elections, when the GOP recaptured the U.S. House, Republicans were looking to capitalize on their success with women. Exit polls suggested that GOP candidates attracted about 12 percent of women who voted for Obama in 2008, and female voters were almost equally split between Republican and Democratic candidates. The Romney campaign has taken a few stabs at improving its standing with women. It has dispatched Romney's wife, Ann Romney, with direct appeals to women, most notably at the Republican National Convention when she declared \"I love you women!\" during her prime-time speech. After the videotaped \"47 percent\" comments were disseminated online by the liberal magazine Mother Jones, the Romney campaign released an ad targeting young mothers and the national debt. Running in swing states like Virginia, the \"Dear Daughter\" ad shows a young mother cradling a baby and noting that \"your share of Obama's debt is over $50,000. And it grows every day.\" It notes the rate of women in poverty and the difficulty women have finding work. Earlier this week, conservative bloggers criticized Obama spokeswoman Stephanie Cutter for comments she made during an interview on NPR member station WAMU, during which she suggested that women are more interested in \"what's going to happen in the next four years\" than in what happened over the past four years. The conservative website Redstate.com posted this after Cutter's comments: \"For reasons that are unclear to me, the Romney campaign has essentially ceded the field in the fight for women who vote based on their sex organs rather than issues. I don't know how big that demographic is, but after one brief attempt with the job loss data for women under Obama nothing has been heard. In the meantime the Obama campaign is hammering home that Romney will defund Planned Parenthood and that will mean Armageddon for women's health because the only health care women ever need is an abortion.\" Nothing For Granted More than 60 percent of Obama campaign volunteers are women, Cutter said on WAMU, including a \"Women for Obama\" group that she asserted was \"300,000 strong.\" They are a \"very powerful tool for us,\" she said, reaching women at home, at work, \"conversation to conversation.\" Though pollsters say the election isn't being driven by the issue of abortion, the nation's largest pro-abortion rights organization has launched its own effort to target women. NARAL Pro Choice America says it has identified through surveys female, pro-abortion rights \"Obama defectors\" \u2014 those who voted for Obama in 2008 but don't plan to this year. They've identified 338,000 such women in 25 key counties in battleground states, says NARAL political director Beth Shipp. Those states: Colorado, Florida, Iowa, New Hampshire, Nevada, Ohio, Virginia and Wisconsin. Most of the \"defectors,\" Shipp says, are women who identify themselves as independents and between the ages of 18 and 39. Their theory is that in a close election, in swing counties, a half a percentage point could make a difference. \"I think elections can turn on a dime,\" Shipp says. \"Our polls show that President Obama is winning women, but not by the margin he won in 2008.\" That's not really what other national and state polls show. Nevertheless, in an electorate composed of a majority of women, and increasing percentages of single, nonwhite women, the gender gap appears destined to widen \u2014 perhaps enough by November, if the tide doesn't turn soon for Romney, to make history.",

            "article_content": "Republican Senate candidate Todd Akin is launching a bus tour across Missouri. He's the congressman whose controversial comments about rape led to calls that he drop out of the race. Tuesday is the last day for Akin to remove himself from the ballot. He's made clear he's in the race to stay, but Akin has an uphill fight to unseat Democratic incumbent Claire McCaskill.  DAVID GREENE, HOST: Let's talk now about one of this fall's key Senate races. In Missouri, Republican candidate Todd Akin is launching a bus tour today. You may remember he's the congressman whose controversial comments about rape led to calls that he drop out of the race. Today is the last day for Akin to remove himself from the ballot. He has made clear that is not going to happen. But he has an uphill fight to unseat the Democratic incumbent, Claire McCaskill. She has the financial advantage and she has the lead in the polls. NPR's Brian Naylor reports from St. Louis. BRIAN NAYLOR, BYLINE: If there were any doubts that Todd Akin was in the Missouri Senate race to stay, the six-term congressman did his best to dispel them at a news conference yesterday. REPRESENTATIVE TODD AKIN: For the - about 100th time or so, I am in this race. (APPLAUSE) AKIN: And the reason I'm in the race is because the people of Missouri chose me to do a job. I take that very seriously and we are going to be totally focused on winning that seat from Claire McCaskill. NAYLOR: Akin appeared at the quaint Kirkwood, Missouri train station, just outside St. Louis. At his side was former House Speaker Newt Gingrich, whom Akin had invited to town for a $500-a-plate fundraiser at a nearby restaurant. Gingrich, who has bucked the establishment some in his own political career, says it's time for GOP leaders to rally behind, and perhaps more importantly write checks for, the party's nominee. NEWT GINGRICH: Todd Akin is a key to our winning control of the Senate, and that every Republican has to ask themselves the question, do you really want Harry Reid back as the majority leader? NAYLOR: Akin has been shunned by Republican leaders since his comment in a TV interview in August that women's bodies have a natural defense against pregnancy in cases of, in his words, legitimate rape. He's since apologized, but Republicans, already facing a yawning gender gap with female voters, have shown little forgiveness. The Republican Senate Campaign Committee has refused to contribute to Akin, in a race it once counted on to help give the GOP a majority in the Senate. Akin, however, says he can still mount a competitive campaign. AKIN: I think it's going to work out well. It's certainly going to have a lot of grass-roots element to the campaign as well, though, and I think the grass roots is very, very strong and getting stronger. So I think that's a big component, but I do think we'll have the money we need to. NAYLOR: He's formed a group, Women for Akin, and can count on supporters like Cecelia Dachsteiner, who wore a Tea Party t-shirt and carried an Akin lawn sign. CECELIA DACHSTEINER: I think he had one poor choice of words and that was it. Sixty seconds doesn't compare to six years of massive tyranny by McCaskill. NAYLOR: But others in Missouri aren't so ready to look past Akin's comments. UNIDENTIFIED WOMEN: You can't escape. It's still called rape. You can't escape. It's still called rape. NAYLOR: A few dozen demonstrators chanted on the sidewalk outside Akin's fundraiser. Many wore pink Planned Parenthood t-shirts. Among them was 73-year-old Susan Cunningham of Pacific, Missouri. She says even if Akin raises enough to run TV ads, he will not win in November. SUSAN CUNNINGHAM: Not a chance. Not a chance. We're not that stupid. He really is - he's running on the premise that people aren't paying attention, but we are. NAYLOR: During the Republican primary, McCaskill had made clear her preference to run against Akin, even before his rape comments. At their first debate last week, she called Akin's views extreme. SENATOR CLARE MCCASKILL: You know, I think Congressman Akin's comments opened the window to his views for Missourians. He has apologized for those comments, but they say a lot about how he views things, and that's where Missourians need to pay attention. NAYLOR: McCaskill has yet to mention Akin's comments about rape in her TV ads. Washington University professor Steven Smith says she doesn't really need to. STEVEN SMITH: I think she's going to remain as positive as she can, but focusing on the rape issue really is not necessary. There's hardly a news account in Missouri about this contest that doesn't have a paragraph about his comments on rape. NAYLOR: McCaskill had more than three million dollars in the bank as of mid-July. Unless Republican leaders have a last minute change of heart, it's unlikely Akin can match that. His best chance will be a big turnout by his base, including Missouri's large number of evangelical voters, hoping that they'll prove he was right to stay in the race.

Republican vice presidential nominee Paul Ryan used an appearance at an annual gathering of his party's social conservatives Friday to pointedly criticize President Obama's foreign policy record and to testify to his own Catholic faith and opposition to abortion. \"We're all in this together,\" said Ryan, a representative from Wisconsin, echoing a theme of Obama's convention speech. \"It has a nice ring.\" \"Yet how hollow it sounds coming from a politician who has never once lifted a hand to help the most helpless and innocent \u2014 the child waiting to be born,\" Ryan said, accusing the president of showing a \"complete disregard for many pro-life Democrats.\" Ryan also made a point of citing the abortion position of the Clinton administration, which asserted that the procedure should be \"safe, legal and rare.\" That philosophy, Ryan claimed, is a relic of a \"different time, and a different president\" (although Obama himself has also said abortion should be \"safe, legal and rare\"). It was some of the strongest anti-abortion language yet to come from the Republican ticket, and it resonated in Washington, D.C.'s Omni Shoreham Hotel ballroom, filled with about 2,000 members of the party's most conservative social wing. They were attending the Values Voter Summit, sponsored by the Family Research Council. GOP presidential candidate Mitt Romney, who once supported legal abortion but now opposes it, was campaigning in Ohio and did not appear at the event. Ryan couched his comments in his Catholic faith and also called for the repeal of the president's health care overhaul legislation, which he characterized as a \"threat and insult to every religious group\" because of its contraception coverage mandates. \" 'Never mind your own conscience,' they were basically told,\" Ryan said. \" 'From now on you're going to do things the government's way.' \" \"Ladies and gentlemen, you would be hard-pressed to find another group in America that does more to serve the health of women and their babies than the Catholic Church and Catholic Charities,\" he said. \"And now, suddenly, we have Obamacare bureaucrats presuming to dictate how they will do it.\" Ryan also did not shy away from the foreign policy crisis that has enveloped Romney, Obama, and American interests throughout the Middle East and North Africa in recent days. Citing first the \"loss of four good men\" in the Tuesday attack on the U.S. Consulate in Libya, Ryan suggested that the \"equivocations\" of the administration make extremists bolder and accused Obama of treating Israel with \"indifference bordering on contempt.\" His comments followed conservative Bill Bennett's robust defense of Romney's much-criticized comments during the unfolding crisis this week in Libya and Egypt. Romney's words, Bennett said, had a \"shock effect because they are true.\" Proof of Romney's veracity, Bennett suggested, was the broad condemnation he received among the \"establishment press.\" He then added an abortion metaphor: \"Much of the press jumped on this to kill this truth in the womb, something it is well practiced at.\" Ryan argued that a \"Romney and Ryan administration\" would establish a foreign policy with \"moral clarity and firmness of purpose.\" Unlike some of the speakers who proceeded him \u2014 including House Majority Leader Eric Cantor of Virginia, and South Carolina Sen. Jim DeMint, who barely mentioned Romney by name \u2014 Ryan closed his comments by attesting to his running mate's good-neighbor bona fides. \"A modest man,\" Ryan said of Romney, \"with a charitable heart.\" During his speech, Ryan was interrupted twice by hecklers, who were quickly removed by security.",

If you missed the second night of the Democratic National Convention in Charlotte, N.C., we live blogged it here. But if you want a quick review, we've compiled five things that struck us about the night: It's Not What You Say, It's How You Say It: In other hands, the very wonky speech that former President Clinton delivered on Wednesday could have been a snoozer. The address was policy heavy and serious. Even though he threw in some jokes, Clinton consistently told the Democratic delegates and the television viewers to \"listen.\" \"You all are having fun,\" he said at one point. \"But this is serious. I want you to listen.\" He talked about the need for compromise and how Obama is committed to \"constructive cooperation.\" He talked about Obama's record \u2014 at length and with many numbers. He offered a rebuttal of Republican attacks and a detailed discussion of Republican policies. Finally, he gave Obama an unflinching endorsement, and he received an equally unequivocal endorsement from the crowd. That said, the speech was delivered with typical Clinton charm. Everything was explained with a folksy disposition that kept the crowd engaged. Israel Is A Touchy Subject For Democrats: The party platform became a distraction today for Democrats. On orders from the president, delegates voted to amend the platform to include both a reference to God and to declare that Jerusalem is the capital of Israel. It took three voice votes to get those changes approved, and it was met with many delegates shouting \"no!\" and with loud boos when the motion was deemed to have passed. Expect to hear more on this story in the upcoming days. Women Are Democrats' First Health Care Defense: The Obama campaign is relying on women to try to one-up Republicans on the health care debate. At every turn they have used women to defend Obamacare and at every turn they have tied women to health care. Tonight, a diverse group of women \u2014 from Sandra Fluke, the woman whom Rush Limbaugh called a \"slut\" in a debate over contraception, to Sister Simone Campbell, the nun on the bus who took on Paul Ryan's budget, to Cristina Saralegui, the so-called Hispanic Oprah \u2014 all provided defenses for Obamacare. Because of Obama, we heard over and over, \"being a woman is no longer a pre-existing condition.\" Bank of America Stadium Was Too Exposed: Whether it was because of the chance of rain or because of the chance of a less-than-packed stadium, Democratic National Convention officials decided that Thursday's acceptance speech by President Obama would move indoors to the much smaller Time Warner Cable Arena, which has hosted the first two nights of the convention. Republicans immediately said Democrats were changing the venue because they couldn't fill it. Democrats said it was because of the chance of thunderstorms and that like the \"65,000 people who signed up for community credentials,\" they were disappointed. Weather.com says Charlotte can expect scattered showers on Thursday with a 40 percent chance of rain. A Surprise Appearance By The President Is Always Effective: Aside from Clinton and a softly delivered, but fiercely populist speech from senatorial candidate Elizabeth Warren, Wednesday was a sleepy night. But as soon as word that President Obama was going to make a surprise appearance spread through the hall, the energy changed. By the time the president hit the stage, the crowd was roaring. It also gave us the image of the day: After a bitter 2008 primary in which Clinton was one of Obama's staunchest critics, the two presidents embraced.",

Supporters and delegates cheered loudly for United Auto Workers President Bob King. Hello from Charlotte, N.C. Today is all about Bill Clinton. Walking around Time Warner Cable Arena in Charlotte, the former president was the talk of the town. Today marks the second day of the Democratic National Convention. We're in the arena and we'll keep tabs on the proceedings. Make sure you refresh this page to see the latest. Update at 11:25 p.m. ET. A Wonky Speech, With A Clinton Delivery: The night ended with President Obama taking the stage, once President Clinton finished his speech. It was a surprise for the crowd, which chanted \"We are fired up!\" for minutes after the two presidents had left the stage. As expected, Clinton also received a roaring welcome when he came onstage to nominate President Obama for president. But the speech he delivered was policy heavy and serious. Even though he threw in some jokes, Clinton consistently told the Democratic delegates and the television viewers to \"listen.\" \"You all are having fun,\" he said at one point. \"But this is serious. I want you to listen.\" In a lot of ways, Clinton's speech was almost a checklist of issues that President Obama had to address during this convention: -- Clinton started with a plea for compromise, by saying that Obama, unlike the Republicans, is committed to \"constructive cooperation.\" \"Heck,\" he said. \"He even appointed Hilary.\" That is Secretary of State Hilary Clinton, Obama's 2008 Democratic primary opponent. -- Clinton gave a point-by-point review of Obama's record: He threw out many numbers on the economy and on health care. -- Then Clinton offered a rebuttal of Republican attacks, including ads that Republicans have been running nationwide. -- And like the lawyer that he is, he then moved on to offer his criticism of Republican proposals. On the economy, he said, they can't compete, because their proposals don't pass the \"arithmetic test\" and they don't pass the \"values test.\" -- Finally, about 25 minutes after the program was supposed to have concluded, he offered an unflinching endorsement of Obama. Update at 10:20 p.m. ET. A Hero's Welcome (For Elizabeth Warren): \"Warren! Warren! Warren!\" That was the welcome senatorial candidate Elizabeth Warren received tonight. Warren has become a folk hero of sorts, one who talks tough against banks and talks about the need for more income equality. \"People feel like the system is rigged against them,\" she said in a calm, soothing voice. \"And here's the painful part: they're right. The system is rigged. Look around. Oil companies guzzle down billions in subsidies. Billionaires pay lower tax rates than their secretaries. Wall Street CEOs \u2014 the same ones who wrecked our economy and destroyed millions of jobs \u2014 still strut around Congress, no shame, demanding favors, and acting like we should thank them.\" A lot has been made about this speech from Warren, because of the neck-and-neck race she's in the middle of in Massachusetts against Republican Scott Brown. \"This is very important. She's being given a national spotlight,\" said Shaw McDermott, a Boston lawyer in the arena. \"It will focus the Massachusetts electorate that her race is ultimately tied to the fortunes of the party.\" Earlier today, Liz Halloran wrote a bit of background for us on Warren. Here's what she reported: Her race with Brown is still rated a tossup, and Warren will benefit from having Obama at the top of her ticket. But Warren, 63, considered a liberal rising star, has struggled to break through in a state where registered Democrats hold a 3-to-1 advantage over Republicans. She also enjoys a nearly $10 million fundraising advantage over Brown. Campaign finance reports show that she'd raised a whopping $28.2 million by the end of August to Brown's $19.4 million. Brown, once a Tea Party favorite who has since tacked to the middle, won a 2010 special election to fill the Senate seat left vacant after the death of Democratic Sen. Edward Kennedy. Kennedy had held the seat for nearly a half century. Winning Massachusetts is a key to the Democrats' hold on control of the Senate. It's no accident she's appearing in prime time during an hour that features one of the party's most popular figures, former President Clinton. An Oklahoma native and Harvard Law professor, Warren emerged as a political entity in the wake of the 2008 Wall Street meltdown. She proposed the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau as part of the 2010 financial regulatory reform known as Dodd-Frank, and as a special assistant to President Obama helped set it up. Warren was once thought to be Obama's choice to head the new consumer bureau, but Republican opposition led him to turn to former Ohio Attorney General Richard Cordray. Warren was also damaged when she did not quickly or decisively answer opponents' questions about her past claims of partial Native American heritage. In recent weeks, she has sought to link Brown with Republican proposals on Medicare and other programs, and their effects on women and the middle class. Update at 10:08 p.m. ET. Two Futures: Sandra Fluke was thrust into the national debate about contraceptives when Rush Limbaugh called her a \"slut.\" Today, she said that at stake in this election are two different futures. Here's a bit of her speech: \"During this campaign, we've heard about the two profoundly different futures that could await women \u2014 and how one of those futures looks like an offensive, obsolete relic of our past. Warnings of that future are not distractions. They're not imagined. That future could be real. \"In that America, your new president could be a man who stands by when a public figure tries to silence a private citizen with hateful slurs. Who won't stand up to the slurs, or to any of the extreme, bigoted voices in his own party. It would be an America in which you have a new vice president who co-sponsored a bill that would allow pregnant women to die preventable deaths in our emergency rooms. An America in which states humiliate women by forcing us to endure invasive ultrasounds we don't want and our doctors say we don't need. An America in which access to birth control is controlled by people who will never use it; in which politicians redefine rape so survivors are victimized all over again; in which someone decides which domestic violence victims deserve help, and which don't. We know what this America would look like. In a few short months, it's the America we could be. But it's not the America we should be. It's not who we are. \"We've also seen another future we could choose. First of all, we'd have the right to choose. It's an America in which no one can charge us more than men for the exact same health insurance; in which no one can deny us affordable access to the cancer screenings that could save our lives; in which we decide when to start our families. An America in which our president, when he hears a young woman has been verbally attacked, thinks of his daughters \u2014 not his delegates or donors \u2014 and stands with all women. And strangers come together, reach out and lift her up. And then, instead of trying to silence her, you invite me here \u2014 and give me a microphone \u2014 to amplify our voice. That's the difference.\" Update at 9:52 p.m. ET. The First Bain Attack: NPR's Liz Halloran sends us this update from the floor: Wednesday night the Democrats took their first real convention arena swipe at Romney's business record at Bain Capital. A trio of former employees of companies that Romney's private equity firm managed or took over and ultimately closed took the stage to excoriate Bain and its effect on their lives. The faces may have seemed familiar, because those onstage have appeared in videos highly critical of Bain. One, union organizer Randy Johnson, has dogged Romney since his 1994 U.S. Senate run in Massachusetts against Sen. Edward Kennedy. Johnson worked for Indiana-based American Pad & Paper, or Ampad, eventually closed by Bain in 1995. \"What I fault him for is making money without a moral compass,\" Johnson said. \"I fault him for putting profits ahead of working people like me. But that's just Romney economics.\" Minnesotan David Foster headed United Steelworkers District 11 when Bain bought Missouri-based GS Technologies, a steel mill, in 1993; it filed for bankruptcy in 2001. Foster, featured in an Obama campaign ad titled \"Steel,\" is now a Democratic activist who heads the BlueGreen Alliance in his state. And Cindy Hewitt was a human resources manager for a Miami medical supply company that Bain held, and then closed, in the late 1990s. Their themes, attempting to undercut Romney's claims of job-creating business experience, were similar: that Romney and Bain saddled functioning companies with debt in intricate transactions that enriched Bain's investors, but killed the original companies. Update at 9:40 p.m. ET. 'Pa'Lante, Pa'Lante': There's been quite a bit of Spanish spoken at this convention. The Latino vote, after all, is one that is expected to play an important role in this election. It all culminated with the appearance today of Cristina Saralegui, who is known as the \"Hispanic Oprah.\" Saralegui had already taken a lead role in supporting President Obama before this convention, cutting ads for the president. Her message was that Obama \"fights for us.\" \"He is on our side,\" she said. Then she repeated a refrain that many of the women have repeated throughout these two days: \"Pa'lante, pa'lante, pa tras ni pa coger impulso,\" she said. \"Forward, forward, backwards, not even to gain flight.\" Update at 9:28 p.m. ET. An Obama Appearance? CNN is reporting that President Obama will be in the arena for President Clinton's speech. NPR's S.V. Date is outside the arena and he tells us that no one is being allowed inside. Update at 9:17 p.m. ET. Where Is Barney? NPR's Liz Halloran sends us this missive from the floor: Longtime Massachusetts Rep. Barney Frank was on tonight's list of speakers, but his scheduled time came and went. (He looks to have been a victim of a convention night that's running way behind.) But Frank, who isn't running for re-election, seems to deserve some attention as his long career winds down. Frank served in the U.S. House for more than three decades, and in the Massachusetts House for seven years before that. Yet it hasn't been until this week that Frank, 72, the first openly and now married gay member of Congress, likely felt the full embrace of his party. Speaker after convention speaker, including first lady Michelle Obama, has embraced the notion of legal same-sex marriage. And the president recently expressed his support of same, with a little unexpected nudge from Vice President Biden. None of that has happened before. We caught up on the convention floor with Massachusetts delegate Lois Pines, a former state senator who was elected to the state House with Frank in 1972. \"He was willing to speak out and be public about his sexual orientation when he was the only one,\" said Pines, who with Frank co-sponsored the state's first gay-rights bill. \"Yes, it's taken people a very long time to accept the principle of equal rights for gay people,\" she said. \"It was very, very difficult because people were very afraid.\" For Frank, a cocky and acerbic Harvard Law School graduate, it wasn't so always so comfortable being \"America's only left-handed gay, Jewish congressman,\" the title of his 2009 autobiography. He was called \"Barney Fag\" by Republican House Majority Leader Dick Armey in 1995. He was reprimanded by the House for fixing a male prostitute's parking tickets. Recently, Frank, a longtime supporter of government housing agencies Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, earned the enmity of many Republicans for co-writing the Dodd-Frank financial regulation law, Through all that, Pines said, \"his district loved him.\" Update at 8:52 p.m. ET. 'An Immoral Budget': Sister Simone Campbell just received one of the biggest standing ovations of the night. She delivered a stealthy attack on Republican vice presidential candidate Paul Ryan. Campbell started a bus tour to tell America about the Ryan budget, she said. \"During our journey, I rediscovered a few truths,\" she said \"First, Mitt Romney and Paul Ryan are correct when they say that each individual should be responsible. But their budget goes astray in not acknowledging that we are responsible not only for ourselves and our immediate families. Rather, our faith strongly affirms that we are all responsible for one another. \"I am my sister's keeper. I am my brother's keeper,\" she said to great applause. Campbell said she felt comforted surrounded by other caring people. \"Together, we understand that an immoral budget that hurts already struggling families does not reflect our nation's values,\" she said. \"We are better than that.\" Ryan, who is Catholic, was hit hard by his church when he released his budget. It sent letters to elected officials asking them to vote against the budget. Update at 8:40 p.m. ET. A Much Slower Pace: Tonight is proceeding at much more leisurely pace. In fact, many seats are empty and the crowd is much calmer. As we said earlier, this night is definitely about Bill Clinton. Last night, the lineup was packed with stars. Today, many have delivered sober speeches with little red meat for the crowd. Update at 8:17 p.m. ET. A Bad Episode Of 'Mad Men': Cecile Richards, president of Planned Parenthood Federation of America, has just delivered the snappiest line of the night. It also encapsulates the line of attack that Democrats are using against Republicans. With Republicans in power in the House, said Richards, \"It's like we woke up in a bad episode of Mad Men.\" That is to say that they believe the policies of Republicans would send the United States into the past, when it comes to women's rights. The female vote is important for Democrats, because it helps them make up the deficit they carry with men. As NPR's Alan Greenblatt told us earlier this week, Democrats haven't carried the male vote in some 30 years. Update at 7:42 p.m. ET. Women, Women, Women: One emphasis that has remained from last night is women. Like they did with the women of the House of Representatives, tonight the Democratic women of the Senate took the stage in a show of solidarity. They stood in a semicircle around Sen. Barbara Mikulski, who delivered the remarks. \"Every issue is a woman's issue,\" she said. Mikulski said that the Democrats, unlike the Republicans, believe that women's issues are simply a part of fundamental American values. At the end of Mikulski's speech, the DJ pumped Katy Perry's pop hit \"Firework\" and the female senators held hands in front of the stage. Update at 7:28 p.m. The Platform Controversy: Note that we've added a separate post explaining that controversy that happened in the opening minutes of the night, when Democrats voted to amend their platform to include a reference to God and proclaim Jerusalem the capital of Israel. Update at 6:20 p.m. ET. Excerpts From Clinton's Speech: The Obama administration released excerpts of the speech Bill Clinton will deliver. He'll echo a lot of what we've already heard from speakers so far: What President Obama wants is a country in which everyone works together, whereas Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney wants a country where everyone fends for himself. Clinton will say: \"In Tampa the Republican argument against the President's re-election was pretty simple: We left him a total mess, he hasn't finished cleaning it up yet, so fire him and put us back in.  \"I like the argument for President Obama's re-election a lot better. He inherited a deeply damaged economy, put a floor under the crash, began the long hard road to recovery, and laid the foundation for a more modern, more well-balanced economy that will produce millions of good new jobs, vibrant new businesses, and lots of new wealth for the innovators.  \"The most important question is, what kind of country do you want to live in? If you want a you're-on-your-own, winner-take-all society, you should support the Republican ticket. If you want a country of shared prosperity and shared responsibility \u2014 a we're-all-in-this-together society \u2014 you should vote for Barack Obama and Joe Biden.\"",

            "article_content": "Mitt Romney proclaimed himself a strong supporter of abortion rights in state campaigns in 1994 and in 2002. Now, he says he opposes almost all abortions.\n                \n                    \n                    Evan Vucci/AP\n                    \n                \nhide caption Mitt Romney proclaimed himself a strong supporter of abortion rights in state campaigns in 1994 and in 2002. Now, he says he opposes almost all abortions. Is Mitt Romney shifting his abortion position again? It's fairly well-known that Romney proclaimed himself in favor of abortion rights when he ran for office in Massachusetts, then reversed himself before launching his presidential bid. But recently, the GOP nominee seems to be softening his opposition somewhat. Or is he? Romney proclaimed himself a strong supporter of abortion rights both in 1994, when he ran unsuccessfully for Senate against incumbent Democrat Edward Kennedy, and in 2002, when he defeated Democrat Shannon O'Brien to become governor. \"I will preserve and protect a woman's right to choose,\" he said in a 2002 debate with O'Brien. \"And I do take exception to Shannon characterizing my view as being any different than hers in this regard; The Boston Globe recently reported there's not a paper's width worth of difference between our two positions in this regard.\" But that changed halfway though Romney's term as governor. He says his conversion came after he talked to a Harvard scientist about embryonic stem cells. Now, he says his position is to oppose almost all abortions. \"My own view is that I oppose abortion except for cases of rape, incest, and where the life of the mother is threatened,\" he told conservative radio host Hugh Hewitt Aug. 24. But that's slightly different from what he told CBS that same week. \"My position has been clear throughout the campaign,\" he said. \"I'm in favor of abortion being legal in the case of rape and incest, and health and life of the mother.\" So in that interview, Romney added one more exception \u2014 for the woman's health. The Romney campaign won't say the candidate misspoke, but a spokeswoman does say he doesn't support an exception to protect the health of the pregnant woman. That's because other abortion opponents, including GOP vice presidential candidate Paul Ryan, insist it creates too large a loophole, since health often encompasses mental health, too. \"The health exception is a loophole wide enough to drive a Mack truck through it,\" said Ryan on the House floor during a debate in 2000 on a bill to ban the procedure some call \"partial birth\" abortion. \"The health exception would render this ban virtually meaningless.\" Beth Shipp, political director for the abortion rights group NARAL Pro-Choice America, says she's stunned by those who oppose exceptions for health reasons. \"They actually think that somehow women make up health problems like diabetes, or kidney failure, or breast cancer,\" she said, \"or any of the myriad of other health concerns that women in this country face when they become pregnant.\" But even without a health exception, the question remains: Does Romney really support abortions for victims of rape? The question has become more relevant in light of the recent controversy surrounding Missouri Republican Senate candidate Todd Akin. He suggested that victims of \"legitimate rape\" couldn't get pregnant, and later apologized. But for all of Romney's efforts to try to distance himself from Akin, when he was governor of Massachusetts, Romney vetoed a bill that would have required that rape victims be provided not abortions, but morning-after pills in the emergency room. \"It's very important to remember that emergency contraception is birth control,\" says Shipp of NARAL. \"It's not RU-486, which people refer to as the abortion pill.\" Although some very ardent opponents say the morning-after pill can technically cause a very early abortion by preventing the implantation of a fertilized egg, medical experts insist that's not how it works. Yet Romney said it could \"terminate life after conception\" in a Boston Globe column explaining his veto. The Republican platform calls for protecting life from conception. It doesn't allow any exceptions, including those for rape, incest or the life of the woman. Shipp says if that's Romney's position, then fine. But voters will see through it if he tries to go back and forth. \"They pay attention. They learn about the issues,\" she said. \"And every time that Mitt Romney tries to reinvent himself, they say, 'But wait a minute, I remember you said ...' They do their homework; they understand the responsibility that comes with voting for the highest office in the land.\" Last week, Romney's oldest sister Jane told reporters at the convention that her brother wasn't going to ban abortion if he becomes president. \"It's not his focus,\" she told a National Journal reporter. But comments like that, clearly aimed at closing the candidate's sizable gender gap, could come as a rude surprise to social conservatives Romney's worked hard to woo for the past seven years.",

            "article_content": "This week's Republican National Convention has been designed to appeal to female voters, not just loyal Republicans but also independents. The effort is driven by the big deficit GOP presidential nominee Mitt Romney has among women in polls with President Obama.  STEVE INSKEEP, HOST: OK. So the president is focused on young voters. At the Republican National Convention, Mitt Romney and his supporters were focused on women. Their effort is driven by the big deficit that Romney has had among women in poll matchups with the president. And that's why the GOP convention featured one high-profile female speaker after another. Here's NPR's Don Gonyea. DON GONYEA, BYLINE: When Mitt Romney's wife Ann took the stage at the RNC on Tuesday, her job was to help Americans get to know the Mitt Romney she knows, the man she fell in love with as a teenage girl in suburban Detroit. But with this one line - one that was not on her prepared script - she also made it clear who her audience was. (SOUNDBITE OF SPEECH) ANN ROMNEY: I love you women. (CHEERING) GONYEA: She was responding to those big cheers from women on the convention floor.  But her speech was designed to speak to a wider world of suburban women - women juggling work and family, the kind of voters who are so critical in battleground states and who helped give President Obama victory four years ago. (SOUNDBITE OF SPEECH) ROMNEY: It's the moms who've always had to work a little harder to make everything right. It's the moms of this nation - single, married, widowed - who really hold this country together. GONYEA: As for the rest of the convention lineup, it seemed just about every female high profile Republican office holder in the country got their turn on the stage - U.S. Senator Kelly Ayotte of New Hampshire, South Carolina Governor Nikki Haley, and New Mexico Governor Susana Martinez. (SOUNDBITE OF SPEECH) GOVERNOR SUSANA MARTINEZ: As the first Hispanic female governor in history, little girls, they often come up to me in the grocery store or in the mall. They look and they point, and when they get the courage to come up, they ask, are you Susana? And they run up and they give me a hug. GONYEA: Former Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice also spoke, as did one of party's potential rising stars, a conservative African-American Mormon congressional candidate from Utah named Mia Love. (SOUNDBITE OF SPEECH) MIA LOVE: President Obama's version of America is a divided one - often pitting us against each other based on our income level, gender, and social status. His policies have failed us. We're not better off than we were four years ago, and no rhetoric, bumper sticker, or Hollywood campaign ad can change that. GONYEA: There were other events outside the convention hall with the same purpose.  At one, longtime \"Entertainment Tonight\" anchor Mary Hart spoke. She noted that Democrats often talk about a Republican war on women. (SOUNDBITE OF SPEECH) MARY HART: So you know what we Republican women have to say to that? We say the only ones who have declared war on women are those who would deny us the right to be independent thinkers. GONYEA: Not highlighted in these convention speeches was the GOP platform that would outlaw abortion even in cases of rape or incest, nor did the speakers mention controversial remarks made by the Republican nominee for the U.S. Senate seat in Missouri, Congressman Todd Akin who drew criticism last week from Mitt Romney and from a long list Republicans when he said women rarely get pregnant when they are victims of, quote, \"legitimate rape.\" Democrats countered the GOP outreach to women in Tampa with their own event a few blocks away from the convention center. Congresswoman Debbie Wasserman Schultz described the GOP effort this way. REPRESENTATIVE DEBBIE WASSERMAN SCHULTZ: I think we believe that women can see through that nice shiny packaging that the Republicans are putting out there through to what's inside. GONYEA: She cited GOP efforts to cut off funding for Planned Parenthood. She noted that vice presidential nominee Paul Ryan opposes abortion and allows no exception for rape and incest. On the economy, she said the president's support of equal pay and other policies are also big factors for women voters. The Republicans' big play for women voters this week in Tampa probably guarantees at least an equally prominent role for women next week, when the Democrats hold their convention in Charlotte, North Carolina.

In case you missed it, the theme here in Tampa at the Republican National Convention on Tuesday was: \"We Built It.\" Intended as a reference to building a business, the three words also suggested another construction project under way \u2014 a bridge to female voters.

Ann Romney, the wife of presidential nominee Mitt Romney, was obviously the focal point for the strategy. But long before she came on stage for her mission of humanizing her husband, the convention had been shown a parade of female officials and officeholders. Prominent among these were Sen. Kelly Ayotte of New Hampshire and Govs. Mary Fallin of Oklahoma and Nikki Haley of South Carolina, all elected in 2010 and all given coveted speaking slots in the evening program (as Gov. Susana Martinez of New Mexico will have Wednesday). And while none of these speakers is likely to displace the memory of Gov. Sarah Palin of Alaska in 2008, all were forceful in attacking the Obama administration and promoting the gospel of female Republicanism. Mayor of Saratoga Springs, Utah, Mia Love addresses the Republican National Convention on Tuesday.\n                \n                    \n                    J. Scott Applewhite/AP\n                    \n                \nhide caption Mayor of Saratoga Springs, Utah, Mia Love addresses the Republican National Convention on Tuesday. Earlier, the arena had been lit up by Mia Love, the mayor of Saratoga Springs, Utah, and a candidate for Congress in that state's 4th District. Love was featured first in a video that only hinted at her personal electricity. The Brooklyn-born daughter of Haitian immigrants, Love (nee Ludmya Bourdeau) became a Mormon when she married her husband, whom she met while he was serving his Mormon mission. The delegates were also introduced to Rep. Cathy McMorris Rodgers of Eastern Washington, a familiar face on Capitol Hill who, as vice-chairman of the House Republican Conference, is the highest-ranking woman in the congressional ranks of the GOP. Rodgers will be a recurring \"host\" of subsequent sessions as well. Even Gov. Chris Christie of New Jersey, the bluff and burly siege gun who provided the night's keynote address, seemed to have gotten the memo. He saluted his mother at length in his recollection of his childhood. He called her \"the enforcer\" and added that in the \"car that was their marriage, my father was the passenger.\" And when excoriating President Obama's health care law, Christie got a roar from the crowd by saying it would \"put a federal bureaucrat between a woman and her doctor.\" The afternoon session was much the same, as Republican National Chairman Reince Priebus called one woman after another to the lectern and often turned to female members of state delegations to make motions. Women making an appearance on stage included Rep. Marsha Blackburn of Tennessee and Nebraska state Sen. Deb Fischer (running for the U.S. Senate), as well as convention co-chair Virginia state Rep. Barbara Comstock. Any observer would have noted the effort being made to advertise the rising of women in the GOP. And indeed, the need for such outreach could not be more glaring. The gender gap, a factor in presidential elections for decades, became starkly dispositive in 2008. Among men, John McCain and Barack Obama were essentially tied. But among women, the advantage for the Democrat was about 12 percentage points, a crushing blow given that more women voted than men. This summer, some polls show Romney clearly leading among men but Obama once again leading by double digits among women. And unless the increasing propensity of women to outvote their male counterparts is reversed, this is an edge that could once again determine the outcome. Republicans have, of course, tried to emphasize female voters before, if not quite so obviously as they are doing here. But the ever greater numbers of women in the delegations and onstage, and even the inclusion of Palin on the ticket in 2008, have not been enough to reverse the trend. One reason may be the party's commitments on certain issues of special concern to many women. Among these is abortion, which has become a partisan dividing line. This year's Republican platform once again supports the Human Life Amendment, which gives constitutional protections to fetuses. Vice presidential nominee Paul Ryan has also supported \"personhood legislation\" to establish the legal definition of life as beginning at fertilization, which would arguably outlaw not only abortion but some forms of contraception. There is not really a debate in the GOP anymore about abortion. But this year the platform committee's work has had greater visibility, in part because of Rep. Todd Akin of Missouri making televised remarks about \"legitimate rape.\" The platform committee's chairman, Virginia Gov. Bob McDonnell, has also been a lightning rod on the issue. Last year he supported a proposed state law that would require an invasive ultrasound before a woman could have an abortion. McDonnell later withdrew his support for that language, but not before it had attracted national publicity at a time when he was being mentioned for vice president himself. When speaking to the full convention, McDonnell did not mention the abortion issue. And other speakers rarely did in Tuesday's speeches. Only Rick Santorum, the former senator from Pennsylvania who was among Romney's rivals for the 2012 nomination, paid extensive attention to abortion or gay marriage. The latter issue is another on which women's views are moderating faster than men's. And, largely for that reason, it is not expected to have nearly the salience it has had in Republican campaigns over the past few cycles.",

            "article_content": "Ann Romney is expected to play more of a traditional \"first lady\" role in tonight's address, while N.J. Gov. Chris Christie will likely throw some punches at the Obama administration.\n                \n                    \n                    Getty Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption Ann Romney is expected to play more of a traditional \"first lady\" role in tonight's address, while N.J. Gov. Chris Christie will likely throw some punches at the Obama administration. It's not exactly good cop/bad cop, but the main speakers Tuesday night at the Republican National Convention will play diametrically opposed roles. Ann Romney \u2014 the wife of Mitt Romney, who becomes the official GOP nominee with Tuesday's delegate roll call \u2014 will try to present her husband in the most flattering, personal light. By contrast, New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, the convention's keynote speaker, will have the job of attacking President Obama's record. It's Political Marketing 101, says GOP Rep. Tim Griffin of Arkansas, a member of the outsized Republican Class of 2010. \"Telling people more about yourself and distinguishing yourself from your opponent, they're both essential parts of communicating with voters,\" he says. Ann Romney has occasionally come across as feisty or combative in interviews and stump appearances this year, but she is expected to play more of a traditional \"first lady\" role in her convention address. One of the major goals for Republicans this week is to present their nominee as likable and relatable, and the candidate's wife may be in a unique position to offer a flattering portrait of \"Mitt the man.\" \"It is a cliche, isn't it, that the wife of the candidate humanizes the candidate,\" says Katherine Jellison, an Ohio University historian. \"That may be a particularly important role this time around because of the stereotypic image of Mitt Romney, that he's stiff and doesn't come across as terribly warm.\" Ann Romney, who has battled multiple sclerosis and breast cancer, has been something of a folk hero in Republican circles since being criticized in April by Democratic strategist Hilary Rosen, who said the candidate's wife had \"never worked a day in her life.\" Rosen apologized, but the comment was seen as demeaning to homemakers. \"Her main task is to go out and be likable and make the viewer think, 'Wow, if this nice, down-to-earth, pleasant woman has been married to this guy for 40 years, he must be OK,' \" Jellison says. Christie, by contrast, is not known for being pleasant. He was elected governor of New Jersey in 2009, attracting national attention as part of the vanguard of aggressive Republican opposition to Democratic policies \u2014 an early part of the wave that may have crested the following year with the election of Griffin and 86 other House Republican freshmen. Christie is known for verbally taking on opponents and succeeding in promoting his own agenda in a state long dominated by Democrats. Christie has challenged public-sector unions and forced their members to pay more toward their own pensions, helping to curb the influence of a once-dominant lobby and balance the budget without raising taxes. He's also cut funding for Planned Parenthood and women's health, notes John Weingart, associate director of the Eagleton Institute of Politics at Rutgers University, putting an end to a longstanding consensus on such issues in the state. \"He's made a huge change in New Jersey government and done things that were inconceivable four years ago,\" Weingart says. Christie is an effective speaker, not because of any poetic turns of phrase, but because he projects a clarity and no-nonsense air that is appealing even to those who may disagree with his policies or not like politicians in general, Weingart says. Christie will serve as a true keynoter, with his combination of blunt talk and policy aggression providing a model for the type of criticism about President Obama that many other Republican speakers will also engage in this week \u2014 notably in areas such as job creation and the size of the federal debt. \"Christie will signal the Republican attack from here on in,\" says Thomas Whalen, a social science professor at Boston University. \"He's going to lay some punches on the Obama team.\" He'll be joined on the podium Tuesday by several fellow governors, including Scott Walker of Wisconsin, Mary Fallin of Oklahoma, John Kasich of Ohio, Brian Sandoval of Nevada and Nikki Haley of South Carolina. Nearly all of them will have stories to share about businesses that were built by close associates or family members, Russ Schriefer, a Romney campaign strategist, said Monday in a conference call with reporters. Those will amplify the day's official theme, \"We Built It,\" which is a dig at Obama for recent remarks that Republicans have interpreted to mean entrepreneurs didn't achieve their success on their own. (Obama noted that business owners had help from government investment in areas such as infrastructure.) Mitt Romney's erstwhile rival Rick Santorum also will speak Tuesday and is expected to echo recent Romney complaints that Obama has weakened welfare law changes that encourage aid recipients to return to work. As a Pennsylvania senator, Santorum was a sponsor of the 1996 welfare law. In short, although Ann Romney will likely present an endearing portrait of the GOP nominee, his other surrogates will pursue a much tougher line of attack. \"My whole deal is reforming, changing, shaking up Washington,\" says Griffin, the Arkansas representative. \"It sure needs it.\"",

Organizers had predicted a turnout of thousands at a rally in a Tampa park Monday morning to protest Republican policies. They ended up getting a better showing, as least early on, from the members of the media desperate to cover something \u2014 anything \u2014 on what was to have been the opening day of the Republican National Convention. Gusty winds left over from tropical storm Isaac, a steady drizzle and canceled charter buses translated into fewer than 200 protesters ultimately taking to the streets to march to the convention site. \"I think people are apprehensive about the weather,\" said Angel Buechner, 39, a welfare rights organizer from Minneapolis who was wearing a t-shirt that read, \"Time to Eat the Rich.\" \"But there are things other than the weather preventing us from excelling,\" she said, and, staying politely on message, adding: \"Like Republicans.\" Gaggles of bored bicycle police were posted at the four corners of grassy Perry Harvey Sr. Park and a helicopter hovered overhead while speakers ranging from union and peace activists, to immigrant and women rights activists worked to fire up the soggy crowd. The messages largely focused on the effect of Washington policy on the middle class and poor, particularly in the areas of education and health care. \"We're trying to build someone above any political party because equality should be above political parties,\" said Jonathan Alingu, 24, an economics major at the University of Central Florida and a student labor activist. The sharpest rhetoric came from Green Party vice presidential candidate Cheri Honkala, who extended her message to the Obama administration, too. \"Don't go vote for the goddamn less of two evils,\" she said. \"The hell with our corporate dominated parties.\" \"Tunisia,\" she said, \"can happen in America.\" It was in Tunisia, after a desperate man set himself afire, that the Arab Spring uprisings began.

At least he's not trying to defund Planned Parenthood and take away choice.\" She said, however, the protesters next week will head to Charlotte, and turn their focus to the Democrats, and Obama.",

Paul Ryan speaks at a campaign event in Fayetteville, N.C., on Thursday.\n                \n                    \n                    Sara D.

Since Republican Rep. Todd Akin first said the words \"legitimate rape\" Sunday, just about everyone in the Republican Party has condemned those comments. The Missouri Senate candidate later apologized, but his remarks continue to drive the political debate. They've also raised questions about the anti-abortion record of the Republican vice presidential candidate, Rep. Paul Ryan of Wisconsin. Akin opposes abortion, even in cases of rape and incest, and so does Ryan, who has a score of 100 percent from the National Right to Life Committee, the highest possible rating. The group's president has praised Ryan for his work on anti-abortion bills since 1999. \"I'm proud of my pro-life record and I stand by my pro-life record in Congress,\" Ryan said in an interview Tuesday with CBS Pittsburgh affiliate KDKA. \"It's something I'm proud of.\" That record includes support for dozens of bills that place restrictions on abortion. Last year, Ryan co-sponsored a bill with dozens of other House members to ban federal funding for abortion. The No Taxpayer Funding for Abortion Act originally allowed exceptions only for \"forcible rape,\" the same language Akin used. When the KDKA reporter pressed Ryan about the phrase, which was later removed, Ryan said: \"Rape is rape. Period. End of story.\" \"So that 'forcible rape' language meant nothing to you at the time?,\" the reporter asked. Ryan replied: \"Rape is rape, and there's no splitting hairs over rape.\" Ryan has been an outspoken opponent of abortion for his entire political career. He backed a measure that makes it a separate crime for a fetus that's killed in connection with another violent crime, and a bill to ban abortion at 20 weeks in the District of Columbia, based on the theory that fetuses can feel pain. Ryan co-sponsored a measure to ban a specific medical procedure, intact dilation and extraction. Abortion opponents call it \"partial birth abortion.\" In a speech on the House floor in 2000, he attacked the health exception that was included in that bill. \"Let me just say this to all of my colleagues who are about to vote on this issue, on the motion to recommit, the health exception is a loophole wide enough to drive a Mack truck through it,\" Ryan said. \"The health exception would render this ban virtually meaningless.\" As congressional colleagues, Rep. Todd Akin (right) and Rep. Paul Ryan have co-sponsored anti-abortion legislation. They're seen here before a press conference on Ryan's budget proposal on Apr. 5, 2011.\n                \n                    \n                    J.

They're seen here before a press conference on Ryan's budget proposal on Apr. 5, 2011. But perhaps the most far-reaching measure Ryan co-sponsored with Todd Akin and many other GOP congressmen is the Sanctity of Human Life Act, which would give legal rights to fertilized eggs from the moment of conception. The bill is similar to personhood initiatives that have been rejected in Colorado and Mississippi. Abortion-rights activists say this legislation would ban some forms of birth control and fertility treatments. This week, Ryan acknowledged that his views did not align perfectly with GOP presidential candidate Mitt Romney on abortion. But speaking on his campaign plane, he said Romney is at the top of the ticket and he will defer to him. \"Mitt Romney is going to be the president,\" Ryan said, responding to reporters questions. \"The president sets policy. His policy is exceptions for rape, incest, life of the mother. I'm comfortable with it because it's a good step in the right direction. I'll leave it at that.\" Meanwhile, Democrats are taking full advantage of the controversy. President Obama condemned Akin's rape comments and went further with this appeal to female voters. \"I think the underlying notion that we should be making decisions on behalf of women for their health care decisions \u2014 or qualifying forcible rape versus nonforcible rape \u2014 I think those are broader issues, and that is a significant difference in approach between ... me and the other party,\" Obama said Monday. The chairwoman of the Democratic National Committee, Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz of Florida, said in an email following Akin's comments that Republicans continue to support legislation that will take \"women back to the dark ages.\" The president's re-election campaign just released a new Web video highlighting \"Republican women for Obama.\" \"If you're a conservative woman and you believe in small government, then Barack Obama is your candidate because he's keeping the government out of the decisions that should remain between you and God and you and your own conscience,\" says a woman in the ad. Democrats will try to extend the debate about women's rights as long as they can. Republicans hope to get back on their campaign message about fixing the economy.",

We're listening to voters where they live \u2014 to understand what's shaping their thinking this election year. This week, we're spending time in Winnebago County, Wis., where we spoke with two women \u2014 one Democrat, one Republican \u2014 who embody their state's Midwestern charm and spirit of self-reliance. Half an hour south of Oshkosh, Wis., in a rural area of Winnebago County, a family-owned fish restaurant sits on the shore of Lake Winnebago. \"This whole system \u2014 Lake Winnebago, the upper river lakes \u2014 is great right now with fishing, duck hunting,\" Shawn Wendt, whose family owns the restaurant, says as he walks on a dock over the lake. \"You have your different types of pan fish, the perch and the bluegills \u2014 they are tremendous \u2014 and then the walleyes. Very good summer of walleye fishing out here on Lake Winnebago.\" Wendt walks from the dock over to some picnic tables, where a few rambunctious children have built a makeshift fort. His two sons, ages 9 and 6, are playing with Nerf guns. Wendt's grandchildren, Zach, 9, and Sawyer, 6, play with Nerf guns outside the family restaurant.\n                \n                    \n                    John W.

The Wendts' restaurant is a family affair. It's been in business for five decades. And Wendt tells us the person we really need to meet is his mom, Linda Wendt. She sneaks to the table amid the barrage of Nerf bullets. She's wearing a turquoise sundress with white-framed sunglasses, and she has long, brightly painted fingernails. At the restaurant, Linda Wendt is the person in charge, overseeing a staff of almost 50 people. And that, more than anything, has made her feel a connection to Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney. \"He has done what I've done, so I can relate to him. I mean, he's made a payroll, you know? He's hired, fired people; he's [run] businesses, many businesses; he did the Olympics. I mean, I guess I look at that \u2014 he knows what business goes through and what it takes to run a business,\" she says. \"President Obama doesn't know that, and that doesn't mean one way or the other thing \u2014 that's not his fault. He just doesn't know what it takes to do it \u2014 in that, yeah, a business probably does make more than the people that you're hiring, but that's what it's about. \"They can work hard to get to where you are, if they so desire. You know, I mean, we're a free country, and that's what it's about, I think.\" Social Issues And Self-Reliance Asked what she thinks about social issues as the campaigns battle to appeal to women, Wendt says: \"Right now, they're saying that women are leaning more toward the Democrat vote ... because Republicans are against women and, oh my goodness, don't want them to have birth control or what have you. \"But I guess I don't feel that way. I don't think religion needs to be in politics together like that. ... As a woman, ... I don't expect you to pay for what I need \u2014 I mean, regardless of whether it is contraception or whatever it might be in life. And again, if we're talking about contraception, there's tons and tons of places you can go to that it's free.\" Wendt says self-reliance is a very important concept in her life. \"When I took over this business, I was scared. I thought, 'How am I going to do this?' ... And then I thought, 'You know what? I know how I'm going to do it. It's just who I am and what I'm going to do. And I'm going to struggle, and that's what it's about. And I'm going to succeed.' \"And I did. And that's what you've got to do. You've got to tell yourself you can do it \u2014 no matter who you are, you can do it if you want to. That's just how I feel. That's how I was raised.\" Different Ways Of Thinking Wendt was raised in a family that values hospitality. That explains why, in the thick of an election year, there's not a single campaign sign on the property. The way Wendt sees it, why risk turning off even a single potential customer, especially in a political swing county? Then again, she probably wouldn't have put up an Obama poster anyway. \"Well, of course, he's a dynamic speaker. I mean, he's excellent. But my thinking and his thinking are different,\" she says. \"He doesn't understand small business \u2014 or any business. He doesn't understand what it takes to run that business. I mean, that's huge for me because I am a business owner, so that would be the top of my list. But my moral views are totally different than his. ... There are some issues that I think he's right on, but very few.\" Those moral issues include things like abortion. \"I don't believe in abortion. I believe in life, and whatever you can do to keep the life going on,\" she says. \"This is, again, a free country that \u2014 we need population, we need more people to keep the country going. And if anybody can get an abortion at any time or any other ways of stopping life, what is the point? \"I mean, and again, I believe there are certain times \u2014 when, you know, the mother's life is at stake or whatever ... I get that. But ... that would be one really big issue really where we're opposite.\" A Business Owner's Perspective Wendt says, as a business owner, she feels that Romney would understand better where she's coming from, \"whereas President Obama doesn't get it.\" \"And you know what? Lot of times I vote for the person, and I have, and I give money to people that are on my page. And it doesn't matter ... what political party they're from,\" she says. She says she's supported Democrats in the past, including President Clinton. What was different about him? \"I felt like he understood me and what I was doing for a living,\" she says. \"I don't feel that way with President Obama. I just don't. There's nothing that tells me that he understands.\" When it comes to the federal health care law passed under Obama, Wendt says she's not sure how it will affect her yet, since it hasn't been fully implemented. \"But, well, it won't be good,\" she says. \"It'll cost more. Supposedly with a small business, if you have over 50 employees, then you need to do something \u2014 it'll affect those. I don't have 50 yet, I have 46, but you know what, I won't get 50. You know what I mean? If it means I'm going to have to pay. And a lot of small businesses just won't hire anybody else.\" Wendt says it does bother her that Romney supported a law similar to the federal health care overhaul when he was governor of Massachusetts. \"And of course, he's somewhat backing away from it,\" she says. But she says she would like to hear more from him on the issue: \"That's one area I don't feel real comfortable about with Mr. Romney.\" As we finish our conversation, Wendt heads inside the restaurant to make sure her kitchen is getting that famous fried perch ready for the lunch crowd.",

            "article_content": "With women's issues front and center again in the presidential campaign, a bus tour through several swing states kicked off Monday in opposition to President Obama's views on abortion. At the same time, the Obama campaign launched a new TV ad \u2014 aimed at some of the same voters in some of the same key states \u2014 criticizing Republican Mitt Romney and his running mate, Paul Ryan, on the issue. As you've probably heard by now, Rep. Todd Akin, R-Mo., told a St. Louis television station in an interview released Sunday that, from what he's heard, pregnancy in the case of rape is rare because, \"If it's a legitimate rape, the female body has ways to try to shut that whole thing down.\" Akin, who's running for Senate against incumbent Democratic Sen. Claire McCaskill, later said he \"misspoke.\" Presumed Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney called the remarks \"insulting, inexcusable, and, frankly, wrong.\" But in a phone interview from the bus tour that kicked off in western Iowa Monday morning, former Rep. Marilyn Musgrave, R-Colo., now with the anti-abortion group the Susan B. Anthony List, defended Akin, calling him a \"very honest man.\" \"He made a mistake, he's admitted it, he misspoke,\" she said. \"Anyone that's a human being can understand that.\" The tour, highlighting what organizers call \"the extreme abortion record of President Obama,\" is visiting 30 cities in the battleground states of Iowa, Wisconsin, Ohio, Virginia and Florida this week. Musgrave criticized several Obama administration policies, such as requiring under the new national health care law that most health insurance plans cover contraceptives, including some of those offered by religiously affiliated employers (but not churches themselves). In an interview with Iowa Public Radio, Musgrave said, \"They want to talk about contraception, but this is really about abortion-inducing drugs and sterilization.\" The federal guidelines require most health plans to cover a variety of preventive and reproductive services, including birth control and sterilization options. Meanwhile, a new Obama campaign TV ad released in Iowa Monday says Romney and his running mate, Rep. Paul Ryan, R-Wis., have \"backed proposals to outlaw abortion, even in cases of rape and incest.\" The ad also is scheduled to air in Colorado, Nevada, Virginia, Ohio and Florida. The fact-check site PolitiFact gave a \"pants-on-fire\" rating to an Obama campaign ad released last month \u2014 before Ryan was announced as Romney's running mate \u2014 for a similar statement about Romney's position on abortion in the case of rape and incest. It said the Obama campaign \"twisted Romney's position to a ridiculous degree.\" In a statement Sunday night, Romney spokeswoman Andrea Saul said: \"Governor Romney and Congressman Ryan disagree with Mr. Akin's statement, and a Romney-Ryan administration would not oppose abortion in instances of rape.\" Romney has stated his support for legalized abortion for rape and incest as recently as last year. But Ryan has supported restrictions on abortion in such cases. In Iowa and other key states, both campaigns have initiatives focused specifically on wooing women voters. Romney's \"Women for Mitt\" campaign, which officially launched last week, has a full-time staffer in Iowa. The president's Women for Obama Steering Committee is organizing phone banks and other events, and plans training sessions for women over the next month in several of Iowa's larger cities.

Iowans are famously nice \u2014 so nice, it seems, they'll let you hold a campaign event on their property even if they won't vote for you. Hours after President Obama paid a visit to a central Iowa farm Tuesday afternoon, the farm owner's adult son issued a statement not exactly in line with the Obama campaign's talking points. Jarret Heil, farmer Jeff Heil's son, calls the president's visit \"truly an honor,\" and describes Obama as \"gracious, personable and very respectful.\" But then his statement takes a turn: \"As the milestone that it is for our community with the President's visit, it is important to not get caught up in the President's glamorous re-election words and remember President Obama's first term record and rhetoric does not represent Middle America, entrepreneurs, small business owners and farmers,\" Heil writes. Jarret Heil, 31, lives about half a mile from his father's farm in rural Haverhill, Iowa, and works on the farm part time. He's a registered Republican, a supporter of Mitt Romney, and, since 2010, the Marshall County treasurer. He's also a former staffer for Iowa Republicans Sen. Chuck Grassley and Rep. Tom Latham. Obama was at the Heil farm primarily to tout his support for tax credits that benefit the wind energy industry. Romney, in contrast, has accused the president of living in \"an imaginary world where government-subsidized windmills and solar panels could power the economy.\" Jarret Heil\n                \n                    \n                    Courtesy Heil\n                    \n                \nhide caption Thing is, industry leaders say the production of those windmills \u2014 all the parts that go into them \u2014 accounts for thousands of Iowa jobs. It's a wind-rich state where many farmers have cashed in by having wind turbines installed on their land. Heil \u2014 not the Romney campaign \u2014 released the statement. It includes a litany of criticisms of the Obama administration, ranging from economic policies to the controversial mandate that employers, including religiously affiliated organizations, cover contraception under their health plans. A Romney spokesman declined to comment. In an e-mail to Iowa Public Radio on Wednesday, Heil said the Obama team chose his father's farm as a good location for a news conference. He said he was \"certain\" the campaign knew, based on background checks of several guests leading up to the event, that his family doesn't support the president. Heil's father, in an interview with the local newspaper, made it clear he's not an Obama supporter, either. The Obama campaign's Erin Seidler said in a written statement Wednesday: \"President Obama greatly appreciates the Heil Family opening up their farm and the opportunity to tour the wind farm. They were wonderful hosts. Wind is important to Iowa's economy, and that's why President Obama is calling to extend the production tax credit.\" In an e-mail exchange, Seidler said the Heils were suggested by the power company MidAmerican Energy as a possible location for the presidential visit. Heil ends his statement by noting that his father prayed with Obama during a private moment at the farm \"for true divine guidance from our Lord Jesus Christ,\" and Obama \"told my father to keep praying for him because he really needs it.\" But it seems the president's hosts won't be praying for his success in November.

            "article_content": "Former Wisconsin Gov. Tommy Thompson at his primary election night party Tuesday in Waukesha, Wis.\n                \n                    \n                    Jeffrey Phelps/AP\n                    \n                \nhide caption Former Wisconsin Gov. Tommy Thompson at his primary election night party Tuesday in Waukesha, Wis. The question of whether GOP vice presidential pick Rep. Paul Ryan of Wisconsin will ultimately help or hurt Mitt Romney's quest for the White House is the subject of fierce debate. But some politicos are calling Ryan a kingmaker following former longtime Wisconsin Gov. Tommy Thompson's slim victory Tuesday in the hotly contested, four-way Republican U.S Senate primary. Why? Ryan gave Thompson a shout-out at a Badger State homecoming rally Sunday, and the former governor quickly incorporated the veep pick's endorsement-of-sorts into a campaign ad. Those who deal in empirical evidence, however, are not so easily convinced that Thompson rode Ryan's words to the win. \"I'm skeptical,\" Charles Franklin, director of the Marquette Law School poll, told us Wednesday. \"In our final poll, we showed Thompson at 33 percent nine days out from the election. He received 34 percent.\" The Marquette poll also accurately predicted the order of finish. About other polls that had Thompson trailing, Franklin said this: \"Do you really believe there was a last-second dynamic, and that the [Ryan] shout-out moved Thompson's number by several percentage points?\" Good question. So, whether Thompson, 70, managed to either hang on to a lead, or surge to the win Tuesday night, he now faces a well-financed and well-known opponent in Democratic Rep. Tammy Baldwin, 50, in a race that will help determine the balance of power in the Senate. Recent polls that tested a head-to-head matchup between the two candidates looking to succeed retiring Democratic Sen. Herb Kohl have given Thompson a slight edge. But it's less, Franklin says, than one might expect, \"given his history as the most popular governor in state history.\" Marquette will have new poll results out next Wednesday, he says, that will measure not only the Thompson-Baldwin race but also where the presidential race stands in Wisconsin after Romney's pick of native son Ryan. Lines Of Attack In a statement released after Thompson's victory, Baldwin made clear she plans to use the former governor's recent-year lobbying career against him. Said Baldwin: \"Tonight, the Republican primary electorate presented Wisconsin voters with a clear choice for the November election. Make no mistake, Tommy Thompson will stand with those who already have too much power and influence in Washington.\" \"I will fight to do what's right for the middle class and Thompson will put those at the very top and the big monied special interests in Washington ahead of Wisconsin's hard-working families. I will take on these powerful interests in Washington, and in the Senate, I will stand up for Wisconsin's middle class, as I always have.\" After a career in the Wisconsin state Assembly, Thompson served 14 years as governor before becoming health and human services secretary in President George W. Bush's administration. He launched a failed bid for the 2008 GOP presidential nomination and has since had what PolitiFact characterized as a \"lucrative private-sector affiliation with dozens of health and other companies,\" including those he oversaw as a member of the Bush administration. Republicans are focusing on Baldwin's well-established liberal record and her support of Obama administration initiatives including the stimulus and the health care overhaul. WisPolitics.com, one of the state's go-to political sites, reported Wednesday that Karl Rove's Crossroads GPS has already begun a one-week, $250,000 ad campaign targeting Baldwin. The site's Election Blog reports on the ad: \"The narrator says Baldwin voted for the 'failed' $1 trillion stimulus package, which included projects like $800,000 to replace light bulbs, and the national debt has increased more than $10 trillion since she went to Congress.\" \"'Tell Tammy trillions wasted is too much. Stop the wasteful spending and cut the debt,' the narrator says before encouraging viewers to support the 'New Majority Agenda.' \" Money Race Franklin, of Marquette, says that Baldwin, who did not have a primary opponent, has raised nearly three times as much money as Thompson. On Wednesday, former Wisconsin Democratic Sen. Russ Feingold and his political action committee, Progressives United, launched what it calls a \"Cheddarbomb\" to add to her coffers. The Center for Responsive Politics reports that Baldwin this cycle has raised $7.1 million and has $3.1 million cash on hand. Thompson has raised $2.4 million and has $352,915 cash on hand. Thompson has some work to do, but though there are fractures in the Republican Party, Franklin says, \"it will surely unite behind him against Baldwin.\" \"There is still residual good feeling from his time as governor, and that's an asset,\" he says, \"though we don't want to overstate it.\" Mike Tate, chairman of the Wisconsin Democrats, indicates his party will make sure that it's not overstated. \"It's been a long time since Tommy Thompson has been in Wisconsin,\" Tate said Wednesday. \"He sold out, left Wisconsin and is too out of touch to fight for Wisconsin.\" For a state that has been at the epicenter of politics and political battles over the past two years, yet another has now been joined. Other GOP Primary Races The biggest primary shock Tuesday came out of Florida, where long-serving GOP incumbent Rep. Cliff Stearns was upended by veterinarian Ted Yoho, who rode Tea Party support to victory. The stunned Stearns, known for his pursuit of the Obama administration's investment in the failed solar energy company Solyndra and for advocating the defunding of Planned Parenthood, conceded Wednesday. Also in Florida, in a battle of two GOP incumbents, Rep. John Mica, who chairs the House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee, easily defeated Rep. Sandy Adams, who had Tea Party support. In Connecticut, pro-wrestling mogul Linda McMahon succeeded in her effort for a second shot at a seat in the U.S. Senate. The Republican McMahon obliterated former GOP Rep. Christopher Shays, winning her party's nomination for the U.S. Senate seat being vacated by independent Sen. Joe Lieberman. In 2010, McMahon used $50.1 million of her own money in a losing Senate race against Democrat Richard Blumenthal. This cycle, she has raised $14 million, which includes just $7 million of her own money. So far. This fall she'll face three-term U.S. Rep. Chris Murphy, who coasted to victory in his Democratic primary.",

            "article_content": "Amy Goldman, known for her gardens and her illustrated coffee-table books about plants, has donated $1 million to a pro-Obama superPAC.\n                \n                    \n                    Sandi Fellman\n                    \n                \nhide caption Amy Goldman, known for her gardens and her illustrated coffee-table books about plants, has donated $1 million to a pro-Obama superPAC. Amy Goldman is best known as the author of lavish books about heirloom tomatoes, squash and melons. Now Goldman is trying to cultivate a second term for President Obama. Goldman wrote a check for $1 million to a pro-Obama superPAC \u2014 and gave another million to the political arm of Planned Parenthood. On a recent summer morning, Goldman was out in the garden early, pollinating heirloom melon plants by hand. Goldman grows hundreds of rare and exotic varieties of melons, tomatoes, squash, beans, peppers and more on her farm in Rhinebeck, N.Y. \u2014 about a two-hour drive north of Manhattan. \"I am a seed saver and collector,\" she says. \"And I'm trying to preserve oldies but goodies.\" Goldman also documents her heirloom crops in illustrated coffee-table books that take years to research and write. From the garden, it's a half-mile uphill to the main house. Goldman drives a motorized cart past acres of woods and gently sloping pasture for cows, chickens and geese, up to an 18th-century farmhouse that she has restored and expanded. If Goldman has an eye for real estate, she might have inherited it from her father. Sol Goldman and his partner built a New York City real estate empire that was estimated to be worth a billion dollars when he died in the 1980s. Amy Goldman never had much interest in the family business \u2014 or, until recently, in politics. \"I couldn't stand by and do nothing,\" she says. \"I just felt like it was time for me to step up to the plate, to try to educate voters about, you know, the real issues.\" 'A Turning Point' The pre-eminent issue for Goldman is women's reproductive rights. She says her mother, Lillian, was a patient of Margaret Sanger, the founder of Planned Parenthood. Goldman has given money to the organization before, but really stepped up her giving in this election cycle. \"I feel like we're at a pivotal point in American history \u2014 a turning point, really, from a women's health and rights perspective,\" she says. \"I'm really, really concerned about the direction this country could take were Mitt Romney to be elected.\" Goldman gave $1 million to Priorities USA Action, the superPAC that's trying to re-elect Obama. She has also given a million to the superPAC Planned Parenthood Votes, which helped to air a TV ad in crucial swing-state markets in Iowa, Florida and Virginia. \"When Mitt Romney says, 'Planned Parenthood, we're going to get rid of that,' Romney is saying he'll deny women the birth control and cancer screenings they depend on,\" the ad says. Dawn Laguens, the vice president of the Planned Parenthood Action Fund, which is responsible for the ad, says Goldman is the kind of donor who wants results, not attention. \"She is not self-aggrandizing,\" Laguens says. \"She'll probably be embarrassed that people are being asked to talk about her because she does not seek that kind of limelight.\" Too Much Money In Politics? Indeed, Goldman tries to downplay the size of her gifts. They are, she says, small change compared to what some big Republican donors will likely spend in an effort to elect Romney. But some wealthy Democrats have been slow to write seven-figure checks to help Obama. Jonathan Soros, the son of billionaire financier George Soros, says he's using his money to try to push for campaign finance reform instead. \"Right now you have a system where both parties are sort of equally beholden to large contributions and independent expenditures,\" he says. \"And until candidates and politicians realize that there's actually a political cost to maintaining the status quo, we're not going to be able to change anything.\" A few weeks ago, Soros announced he was giving money instead to a new superPAC that plans to spend money in congressional races \u2014 with the hope of counteracting the influence of other superPACs. Many critics on the left have faulted the Supreme Court decision in the Citizens United case that opened the door for big money donors. Goldman also thinks Citizens United should be overturned, but she's a realist: \"We haven't been able to turn back Citizens United. We have to cope with the new reality. At least to my mind, the two superPACs I've donated to can be an enormous force for good. I see it as a public education campaign.\" And if her contributions happen to drive women away from Romney and toward Obama, Goldman won't mind that, either.",

            "article_content": "Rep. Paul Ryan of Wisconsin shakes hands with Mitt Romney as he's introduced as Romney's vice presidential running mate Saturday in Norfolk, Va. The USS Wisconsin is in the background.\n                \n                    \n                    Saul Loeb/AFP/Getty Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption Rep. Paul Ryan of Wisconsin shakes hands with Mitt Romney as he's introduced as Romney's vice presidential running mate Saturday in Norfolk, Va. The USS Wisconsin is in the background. Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney discarded his increasingly inert better-safe-than-sorry campaign strategy Saturday when he named budget hawk and Democratic bete noire Rep. Paul Ryan of Wisconsin as his running mate. The decision to go with Ryan, 42, the conservative architect of recent GOP budget proposals that would slash federal spending and remake entitlement programs like Medicare (though not cut the deficit for decades) delighted conservatives who had begun loudly and publicly grousing about the trajectory of Romney's campaign, and who had long been suspect of Romney's conservative bona fides. It also brought aboard a young, culturally conservative Catholic from a battleground state that for the past two years has been ground zero in the war over the size of government, the role of public unions and the future of entitlement programs. \"Ryan is a good choice and a clear attempt to add some policy heft to the Romney ticket,\" Matt Kibbe, president of the national Tea Party organization FreedomWorks, told NPR. \"It will force both candidates to have a more serious debate about the right path to economic recovery.\" How the choice of Ryan, the seven-term Wisconsin congressman whose budget proposals have become manifestos of the small-government movement, may affect Romney's fortunes in key swing states like Colorado, Ohio and Virginia is less clear. But the pick has handed Democrats a trove of material mined from Ryan's budget-cutting proposals, including a scenario to convert Medicare into a block grant program that they already are leveraging in an effort to weaken the GOP ticket's appeal among independent voters, women and senior citizens, including in must-win states like Florida. Here's a sample of the fight to come, now that Ryan, chairman of the House Budget Committee, is on the ticket: \"If there were ever any doubt that Mitt Romney is not on the side of working people, today's choice of Rep. Paul Ryan as a running mate makes it crystal clear,\" Mary Kay Henry, president of the Service Employees International Union, said in a statement. Ryan's \"no-holds barred record of attacking seniors, children, and working men and women is frightening for the 99 percent of Americans who are not rich,\" Henry says. Jim Messina, Obama for America campaign manager, characterized Ryan as \"the architect of the radical House budget\" who supports \"new budget-busting tax cuts for the wealthy.\" The battle, however, is one that conservatives like longtime strategist Ed Rogers say they are ready for. The Ryan pick, he says, suggests that \"Romney will fight from a conservative point of view. It means Romney gets it.\" \"America is in trouble,\" Rogers says. \"We must be honest.\" Reeling from a summer of sliding approval ratings and an expensive and ugly advertising war with President Obama, Romney bypassed potential, and far less controversial, running mates in former Minnesota Gov. Tim Pawlenty, touted for his \"regular guy\" appeal, and Ohio Sen. Rob Portman, viewed as Oval Office ready and with potential to help the ticket in a key Buckeye State county. Though his pick was hailed by some Tea Party movement leaders, Ryan embodies a number of qualities the movement does not embrace: He's spent his entire career in or around Congress, he voted for the auto maker loans, and for the Wall Street bailout. The effect of vice presidential candidates on the fortunes of the top-of-the-ticket nominee most often proves negligible. But the addition of Ryan to the mix focuses the campaign on the future of Medicare and Social Security (Ryan has favored its privatization), as well as his views on women's health issues and the size of government. Romney, while exciting his base with Ryan, faces the twin prospect of losing ground with important constituencies in swing states \u2014 constituencies, in particular women, he's already been struggling to corral. An Obama ad campaign on the air in swing states, including Iowa, has already been hitting Romney for being out of touch with women. Abortion rights advocates, like Nancy Keenan of NARAL Pro-Choice America, have begun defining Ryan's congressional record on abortion as \"extreme.\" \"He has cast 59 votes on reproductive rights while in Congress and not one has been pro-choice,\" Keenan said, adding that he has supported efforts to defund Planned Parenthood. Romney, in picking a young and controversial star of the conservative right, has gambled that Republicans who may have been inclined to stay home in November will now vote \u2014 and vote in numbers that will more than offset the votes he may lose by picking a young and controversial star of the conservative right.",

            "article_content": "President Obama is in the midst of a two-day campaign swing through Colorado. The Rocky Mountain West is a key battleground area in the November election. A new poll shows the president leading Mitt Romney among women in the state but trailing his Republican rival among Colorado men.  RENEE MONTAGNE, HOST: This is MORNING EDITION, from NPR News. Good morning. I'm Renee Montagne. STEVE INSKEEP, HOST: And I'm Steve Inskeep. National surveys show President Obama pulling a bit farther ahead of Mitt Romney - three or four points in some of the averages of surveys. But the election is decided state-by-state, and within those states, political pros slice the vote into demographic groups. In the battleground state of Colorado, the president leads among women, but Romney leads among men. The president focused on women voters in Denver yesterday, as NPR's Scott Horsley reports. SCOTT HORSLEY, BYLINE: An oversized banner at the Denver rally advertised women's health security. And while the event was open to the public, the Obama campaign deliberately packed the crowd of 4,000 with members of local women's groups. Just in case anyone missed the point, the campaign invited Sandra Fluke to introduce the president. The Georgetown Law School graduate became a lightning rod earlier this year when she spoke up in favor of insurance coverage for birth control. SANDRA FLUKE: Even though it's 2012, we're still having the debates that we thought were won before I was even born, debates about access to contraception and whether a woman has the right to make her own health care decisions. HORSLEY: President Obama's health care law requires most insurance plans to provide free coverage for birth control and other preventive measures. Mr. Obama criticized Republican challenger Mitt Romney, who wants to end federal funding for all family planning. (SOUNDBITE OF SPEECH) HORSLEY: Romney announced his own outreach effort yesterday called Women for Mitt. The group is chaired by the candidate's wife, Ann Romney. A new Quinnipiac University poll shows Mr. Obama leading Romney among women in Colorado. But Romney has an even bigger advantage among men, putting him ahead in the poll statewide. Outreach to women and Latino voters helped Democratic Senator Michael Bennet win Colorado two years ago, bucking a national trend of Republican victories. Yesterday, Bennet told a crowd in Grand Junction, Colorado history might repeat itself. (SOUNDBITE OF SPEECH) HORSLEY: Grand Junction, on the western slope of the Rocky Mountains, is traditionally Republican territory, though more than 2,000 supporters filled a stuffy high school gym to hear the president. Mr. Obama is back on GOP turf today in Colorado Springs, home to a large number of religious conservatives. Campaign spokeswoman Jen Psaki notes even though Mr. Obama lost these parts of Colorado four years ago, he kept it close enough, even in GOP strongholds, to carry the state. JEN PSAKI: We're not saying that we're going to make up a 20-point deficit. But we know that for every voter in Colorado Springs, every voter in Grand Junction that comes our way, that's another vote in Colorado towards getting us over the finish line there and towards getting us towards the 270. HORSLEY: That's the number of electoral votes Mr. Obama needs to hold on to the White House. Psaki and other Obama staffers were asked repeatedly this week about a controversial TV ad produced by a pro-Obama superPAC. The ad features a steelworker who suggests his wife died without health insurance because he was laid off by a company taken over by Romney's private equity firm, Bain Capital. The Obama campaign neither criticized the ad, nor took responsibility for it. But Mr. Obama was not shy about criticizing Romney's economic plan, saying it would give tax cuts to the rich at the expense of the middle class. (SOUNDBITE OF SPEECH) HORSLEY: When a crowd here chanted four more years, the president said he will get that time in office if he wins Colorado. Scott Horsley, NPR News, Pueblo, Colorado.

Democratic incumbent Claire McCaskill is facing a tough re-election fight. Outside conservative groups have already been running ads against her.

Meet The Candidates In Neosho, Mo., on the edge of the Ozarks, summertime in an election year can only mean one thing: the Newton County Republican Party's watermelon fest. On an evening still hot after a day of triple-digit temperatures, folks eagerly line up as members of the Republican Women's Club slice pieces of the big melons. It will be a crowded Republican ballot next Tuesday, with contested races for nearly all statewide offices. The three major Republicans running for the Senate nomination each have three minutes to make their case. U.S. Rep. Todd Akin touted what he called his proven conservative voting record in Washington: \"If you want somebody who is a genuine conservative and has taken the tough votes and paid the price politically for that, then you know that you've got a known quantity as a conservative in Todd Akin.\" Sarah Steelman, the former state treasurer, said she stands out from the other Republican candidates: \"I have never been part of the good old boys club, and I never will be,\" she said. \"And if you send me to the U.S. Senate, I'm not going to knock politely on that door and sneak in and close that door behind me. Businessman John Brunner is making his first run for elective office in the Missouri Senate race.\n                \n                    \n                    Brian Naylor/NPR\n                    \n                \nhide caption Businessman John Brunner is making his first run for elective office in the Missouri Senate race. \"No, sir, I'm going to kick that door down, and I'm going to take every one of y'all with me, and we're going to rattle some cages.\" Finally came John Brunner, a businessman making his first try at elective office: \"I spent over 33 years in a small manufacturing business. ... I know what it's like to be on the receiving end of government regulations, on taxes, on high energy prices \u2014 because I'm absolutely convinced we can get this country turned around if we went back to American energy.\" Conservative Credentials Retiree Ben Lang says he has met and supports Brunner. \"He shares the same values that I have,\" Lang says. \"I'm fearful for the direction the country's going in, and I have two wonderful grandchildren that I'm worried about. And I just don't like what the Senate's been doing for the last three or four years.\" There are few substantive differences on the issues among the three Republicans. All are dyed-in-the-wool conservatives, in a state that seems to be all but out of reach for President Obama. \"They're all very conservative,\" says Ken Warren, a professor of political science at St. Louis University. \"And the joke around Missouri has been that they're trying to 'out-conservatize,' so to speak, the other ones. \"They all really support Tea Party issues and [are] trying to essentially equate McCaskill with Obama because Obama is quite unpopular in the state of Missouri.\" Big Money And High-Profile Endorsements U.S. Rep. Todd Akin, R-Mo., who is seeking the GOP nomination for a Senate seat, has the backing of popular Republican Mike Huckabee.\n                \n                    \n                    Brian Naylor/NPR\n                    \n                \nhide caption U.S. Rep. Todd Akin, R-Mo., who is seeking the GOP nomination for a Senate seat, has the backing of popular Republican Mike Huckabee. Still, it has been a wild and expensive race, fought largely on the airwaves. Brunner, the businessman, has spent an astonishing amount of his own money \u2014 nearly $7 million \u2014 on his campaign. Steelman has the endorsement of Sarah Palin, who cut a classic Palinesque ad on her behalf. \"Sarah is an economist who defends our tax dollars like a mama grizzly defends her cubs,\" Palin says in the ad. \"Sarah Steelman earned her reputation as a conservative maverick.\" And Akin, who has struggled to gain statewide name recognition beyond his base in the St. Louis suburbs, has an ad with his own endorsement from Mike Huckabee, the popular Republican and Fox News commentator. \"A Bible-based Christian, Todd Akin supports traditional marriage, defends the unborn and voted to defund Planned Parenthood,\" Huckabee says in the spot. Even McCaskill has gotten into the act, running her own ads challenging the Republicans who hope to unseat her in November. One ad backhandedly compliments Akin as a \"crusader against bigger government\" and then condemns him, saying he \"would completely eliminate the departments of Education and Energy and privatize Social Security.\" A recent St. Louis Post-Dispatch poll has Brunner leading Steelman and Akin. The same poll showed all three Republicans defeating McCaskill in the fall, giving even more weight to Tuesday's primary.",

Along with the highlights, the trade rumors and news of misbehaving athletes, viewers of ESPN's SportsCenter are about to get a bigger dose of politics. The sports giant says it will sell commercial time to candidates in local markets now instead of just nationally. Executives are selling it as a good fit for politicians. \"Sports has become so culturally relevant, and the live nature of the programming has made what we happen to have at ESPN very attractive to the advertising community across all kinds of products,\" says Ed Erhardt, the network's president of sales. \"And those concepts would be applicable to political candidates as well.\" Local political ads won't just appear on the nightly highlights show SportsCenter; they'll also pop up on ESPN's college and NFL games this fall. Those games could prove irresistible to candidates looking to hit a wide swath of voters, especially traditionally hard-to-reach young white men. \"If you're looking for white males in battleground states, football is a very good way to reach them. Think about battleground states in the Midwest like an Ohio or a Wisconsin,\" says Ken Goldstein, president of the ad tracking firm Kantar Media CMAG. \"What's it worth to be on an Ohio State-Wisconsin football game in the fall just before a presidential election? I think the answer is a lot.\" ESPN isn't the only network that will be mixing sports and politics in the coming days. President Obama's campaign says it will spend $5.5 million on ads during NBC's Olympics coverage. And Restore Our Future, a superPAC that backs Republican candidate Mitt Romney, announced a $7 million Olympics ad buy. The Obama campaign has also been advertising during baseball. One ad focusing on the candidates' stance on contraception and abortion ran during a recent Washington Nationals game, presumably aimed at female voters in the northern suburbs of Virginia, a swing state. While selling a candidate when viewers are looking to escape into sports may seem counterintuitive, in practical terms it makes sense for candidates. \"Regular viewers of sports tend to be those types of voters who turn out in higher numbers than viewers of other types of genres,\" says Michael Franz, a government professor at Bowdoin College. \"In the case of the Olympics, for example, not only will regular Americans who are not sports enthusiasts be watching but obviously sports enthusiasts will be watching closely, and that type of regular sports viewer is someone who regularly turns out to vote in high numbers.\" Another advantage of sports programming: It's usually watched live, meaning viewers aren't able to fast-forward past a commercial (though they still can escape to the refrigerator or elsewhere). But candidates might be advised not to run their standard attack ad during a game. \"If you have a theme to your advertising, it might involve an athlete, it might involve a sport, might involve competition. ... All of our research shows that those ads tend to perform better,\" says ESPN's Erhardt, who has found that in advertising during sports, context is key. \"If the advertising that a political candidate would do on ESPN is thought out and is creatively relevant within that context, I do believe it will be more effective rather than it just being the same advertising that they're running everywhere. With the upcoming blitz of political ads on sports programs, the phrase \"here's the pitch\" takes on a whole new meaning.",

            "article_content": "President Obama attacked Republican rival Mitt Romney's budget math during a campaign rally in New Hampshire Monday. The Granite State has just four electoral votes, but it's expected to be hotly contested in November. The two presidential candidates also tangled over immigration policy on the same day the Supreme Court struck down portions of Arizona's immigration law.  RENEE MONTAGNE, HOST: Let's go now to the presidential campaign trail. On the day Supreme Court struck down portions of a controversial Arizona immigration law, President Obama and his rival Mitt Romney tangled over immigration policy. Still, at a political rally yesterday in New Hampshire, Mr. Obama mostly focused on other issues, like the economy. New Hampshire has just four electoral votes, but it's expected to be hotly contested in November. NPR's Scott Horsley has this report from New Hampshire. SCOTT HORSLEY, BYLINE: Fans of Mr. Obama stood for hours in a steady downpour waiting to catch a glimpse of the president. Some had umbrellas or makeshift tarps. Others just got soaked. Either way, Steve Cunningham of Nashua, New Hampshire said it was worth it. STEVE CUNNINGHAM: We no longer have time for sunshine patriots. We have to stand up, be recognized, be counted. It's America, man. HORSLEY: Four years ago, Mr. Obama won New Hampshire by nearly 10 points. But while the state's economy is doing better than most, with an unemployment rate of just 5 percent, it's considered a true toss-up this year. Dennett Page is an Obama supporter from Portsmouth. DENNETT PAGE: Clearly, we can't take anything for granted - not only here in New Hampshire, but nationwide. So it's really, really important that everybody rolls up their sleeves. We may not get the momentum that we had in 2008 and the magic and the whirlwind campaign, but clearly, if everybody does their part and votes, we'll be in good shape. CUNNINGHAM: Inside a steamy high school gym, Mr. Obama told supporters it's up to them to break the stalemate between two very different governing philosophies. He said the big tax cuts and deregulation championed by Mitt Romney and congressional Republicans are simply a retread of the approach George W. Bush took in the years before the economic downturn. (SOUNDBITE OF SPEECH) HORSLEY: Romney has proposed more tax cuts, especially for the wealthy, and more spending on the military. Mr. Obama says the only way he can do that without exploding the deficit is to cut government programs and tax deductions that benefit the middle-class. (SOUNDBITE OF SPEECH) HORSLEY: Mr. Obama also won applause for his efforts to make birth control more widely available, to allow gays and lesbians to serve openly in the military and to give temporary legal status to illegal immigrants who came to the U.S. as children. (SOUNDBITE OF SPEECH) HORSLEY: Mr. Obama didn't dwell on immigration in New Hampshire, where less than 3 percent of the population's Latino, but he did issue a statement praising the Supreme Court's decision to strike down most of an Arizona law targeting illegal immigrants. The president said a patchwork of state laws is not a solution, adding it's clear that Congress needs to act on more comprehensive reform. Romney, who's taken a tough line on illegal immigration, was in Arizona yesterday. He told campaign donors there he would have preferred the Supreme Court give more latitude to the states. Romney's spokesman, Rick Gorka, repeatedly ducked questions about the specifics of the Arizona law, while blaming Mr. Obama for what he said was a lack of leadership. RICK GORKA: Arizona, like many other states in this nation, have taken upon themselves to craft policies for their own specific states. The governor has said repeatedly that states are a laboratory of democracy. What one state drafts may not work in others. But ultimately, this, again, goes back to the president's failure to deliver on his campaign promises. HORSLEY: Back at the high school in New Hampshire, Mr. Obama told the crowd he expects a close contest in November. (SOUNDBITE OF SPEECH) HORSLEY: By the time the president finished speaking, the rain had stopped, and a little sunshine was peeking through the clouds. That gave David O'Donnell of Portsmouth one more reason to be impressed with Mr. Obama. DAVID O'DONNELL: See what his voice does? It clears up the weather, too. It clears up the economy, creates jobs, helps education and straightens out the weather. HORSLEY: Not every Granite Stater was so sanguine about the break in the rain, though. As Brian Bresnahan of Coos County warned, this is New Hampshire. Give it a minute. Scott Horsley, NPR News. Copyright \u00a9 2012 NPR.  All rights reserved.

Tim Pawlenty during a campaign stop Saturday in Cornwall, Pa. Back in April when NPR looked at Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney's potential running-mate picks, Florida Sen. Marco Rubio and GOP Govs. Mitch Daniels of Indiana and Bob McDonnell of Virginia were on our short list. But this week, the contours of the GOP veepstakes have shifted. Daniels is reportedly in line to become president of Purdue University. And McDonnell's prospects dimmed after his recent high-profile in-state battles over contraception and mandated pre-abortion ultrasounds. And what of rising star Rubio, 41, the son of Cuban immigrants and a favorite of Tea Party conservatives? News accounts this week based on unnamed sources asserted that the former member of the Florida House of Representatives wasn't even being vetted for the job. Romney's initial response when asked about the reports was: \"Only Beth Myers and I know who is being vetted.\" Myers is a longtime Romney aide who is heading the search. But by late Tuesday, after hours of headlines about Rubio's reported lack of vetting, Romney attempted to bat down the anonymous reports as false. \"Marco Rubio is being thoroughly vetted as part of our process,\" he said. With all of that in mind, we decided to take another look at the potential GOP veep list, including the recent rise in the stock of former Minnesota Gov. Tim Pawlenty. He is perhaps best remembered nationally as the unlucky candidate who appeared poised to be the Republican vice presidential pick in 2008 before nominee John McCain went rogue with then-Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin. There are still vice presidential long \u2014 and longer \u2014 shots out there, including Sen. John Thune of South Dakota and Govs. Brian Sandoval of Nevada and Bobby Jindal of Louisiana. In the wake of conflicting (and embarrassing) reports that Rubio either is or isn't being vetted, we'll leave the party's most prominent Hispanic in the long-shot category for now. Here's a look at shortlist contenders: Rob Portman, 56 Current job: U.S. senator from Ohio Past posts: Director of Management and Budget, and U.S. Trade Representative under President George W. Bush; U.S. representative from Ohio; director of Office of Legislative Affairs and associate counsel to President George H.W. Bush Upside: Expert on Congress, trade and money issues; from a key swing state; seen as a safe choice Downside: Strong ties to Bush administration and its policies; polls suggest he doesn't rouse voters in Ohio, and Gallup survey says 62 percent of Americans have never heard of him Tim Pawlenty, 51 Current job: Romney campaign co-chair; paid speaker represented by Leading Authorities agency (typical fee about $24,000, according to a 2011 FEC filing); serves on several corporate boards Past posts: Governor of Minnesota; member and majority leader of Minnesota House of Representatives; vice president of software company Wizmo Inc.; Eagan City Council member; lawyer Upside: Comfortable, \"Joe Six-Pack\" balance to businessman Romney; two terms of executive experience as governor; evangelical Christian Downside: Referred to Romney health care overhaul in Massachusetts as the blueprint for \"Obamneycare\"; taint of failure after missing the vice presidential nod in 2008 and his short-lived, lackluster 2012 presidential campaign Paul Ryan, 42 Current job: U.S. representative from Wisconsin and chairman of the House Budget Committee Past posts: Legislative director for Sen. Sam Brownback, R-Kan.; staff assistant at Empower America; aide to Sen. Robert Kasten, R-Wis. Upside: Hero to anti-tax, fiscal conservative base; viewed as expert on budget; unafraid to go on attack on the stump Downside: Highly polarizing; party would lose its most aggressive budget cutter in Congress Kelly Ayotte, 43 Current job: U.S. senator from New Hampshire Past posts: New Hampshire attorney general and deputy attorney general; legal counsel to New Hampshire Gov. Craig Benson; state prosecutor; lawyer at Manchester, N.H., law firm Upside: A woman seen as party up-and-comer; represents swing state Downside: Inexperience on national stage; \"informal\" Romney adviser tells MSNBC that Palin \"poisoned the well\" for a female vice presidential candidate this year Chris Christie, 49 Current job: Governor of New Jersey Past posts: U.S. attorney for the District of New Jersey; lobbyist for Dughi, Hewit & Palatucci; member of the Morris County Board of Chosen Freeholders Upside: Popular national figure; blunt personality appealing Downside: Popular national figure; blunt personality appealing \u2014 which has the potential to overshadow the candidate, a la McCain/Palin in 2008",

What do women want, electorally speaking? We know that women, like men, are \"not some monolithic bloc,\" to quote the current occupant of the White House. But as a group they are reliably influential voters, more risk-averse than men, and \u2014 pollsters tell us \u2014 generally more likely than the opposite sex to vote for Democrats, oppose the use of military force and support government programs. In 2008, unmarried women, one of the nation's fastest-growing demographic groups, were a key to Barack Obama's presidential win. They broke for the Democratic senator from Illinois over Republican Sen. John McCain, 70 percent to 29 percent; married women preferred McCain, 50 percent to 47 percent. Four years earlier, unmarried women \u2014 those who are single, separated, divorced or widowed \u2014 preferred Democratic presidential candidate Sen. John Kerry, 62-37 percent. The margin was similarly tilted in favor of Democrat Al Gore in the 2000 White House contest. But \u2014 and this is key \u2014 married women supported Republican George W. Bush in both those earlier elections by measurably wider margins than they went for McCain. In 2004, for example, they preferred Bush over Kerry by 11 percentage points. So it's no surprise that female voters have been a focus of both parties going into a presidential contest that promises to be exceedingly close. Democrats have been fueling their Republican-war-on-women narrative; Republicans are counterprogramming with a focus on how women have been walloped as the economy continues to falter. Instead of just asking what women want, the more salient question may be a two-parter: We put those questions to pollsters who have been tracking voter preferences in this presidential year. Here's what we've come away with at this point in the race: Republicans will most likely continue to have marginal opportunity for inroads with unmarried women, even given the faltering economy. Unmarried women present Republicans their most vexing combination \u2014 voters who are predominantly young, or youngish, and women. \"Both groups are very difficult for Republicans,\" says Iowa-based pollster J. Ann Selzer, who conducts surveys for Bloomberg News. Mitt Romney speaks to a group that included female business owners in Chantilly, Va., on May 2.\n                \n                    \n                    Jae C. Hong/AP\n                    \n                \nhide caption Mitt Romney speaks to a group that included female business owners in Chantilly, Va., on May 2. In some ways, the task is even more difficult than trying to peel away African-American votes from the Democratic Party. \"They have more opportunity with Hispanics than with women,\" Selzer says, noting, however, that Romney may have room to increase his margin with \"affluent white women.\" Says ABC pollster Gary Langer of Langer Research Associates: \"A Republican candidate is a hard sell among unmarried women because they are so rooted in the Democratic Party.\" Romney has the opportunity to gain ground with married women. Langer argues that incumbents like Obama typically get the benefit of the doubt when people make Election Day choices. If voters decide they're satisfied with the incumbent, \"you move on, you're done.\" The challenger gets a look only after that initial calculation. \"But I think Obama loses some of the natural advantages of incumbency because of the economy,\" Langer says. And, among women, those who are married \"are more movable, and present more opportunity for the Republican Party,\" he says. ABC's late May survey that showed a Romney rebound among women (though he still trailed Obama in favorability, 52-41 percent) largely reflected Republican women coalescing around the candidate at the end of the party's primary season battles. But, Langer says, those moving to Romney also included a not-insignificant number of non-Republican women, independents, and \"even some Democratic women expressing a more favorable view.\" A Selzer survey for Bloomberg released in March showed that women view the Democratic Party only a bit more favorably than they do the GOP. The female-vote gap may benefit Obama in states where contraception and abortion issues were local. A new Quinnipiac University Polling Institute survey taken in Pennsylvania cited Obama's strong support among women and independents as fuel for his 46-40 percent lead over Romney in the Keystone State. President Obama speaks at a White House forum on women's issues on April 6.\n                \n                    \n                    Carolyn Kaster/AP\n                    \n                \nhide caption President Obama speaks at a White House forum on women's issues on April 6. Tim Malloy, the institute's assistant director, says that comments made in March by the state's GOP Gov. Tom Corbett defending a bill that would have required women to have an ultrasound before an abortion contributed to the president's hold on a steady lead. (Corbett said that an ultrasound is not that big an issue because women \"just have to close your eyes\" during the procedure.) \"I'm not saying there's a war on women, but this perpetuated the perceptions that Democrats have pushed,\" Malloy says. The \"war on women\" narrative is a \"long-term strategy,\" Selzer says, \"and Democrats are working to provide the evidence that it's true.\" That included pushing the \"Paycheck Fairness Act\" in Congress last week. Polling in Pennsylvania, however, also shows that Romney is outperforming Obama on the question of who is better on the economy, while the president's personal popularity continues to exceed Romney's. The economy will be the key for men and women, and it's up to the candidates to make their case. \"The economy overwhelmingly is the issue of the election,\" Langer says, noting that more than half of people he surveyed named it as the most important issue, with all other issues measuring in the single digits. \"In the later spring,\" he notes, \"we've had a period of increasing economic discontent with a slowdown of earlier-year improvements in the job market \u2014 and that's weighing fairly heavily on women.\" The president, he says, is vulnerable on the economy. \"Mitt Romney will get a look, but he has not seized the opportunity and proven that he can do better,\" Langer says. \"The question is, can he make the case that he can?\" What women, married and unmarried, want isn't very different from what men want, what all Americans want, he says: a return to economic opportunity and an ability to get and hold a job. There is opportunity for both Obama and Romney, with a narrow but important cadre of female voters, largely married, largely moderate, to help swing November's vote in their favor.",

But the two men's lives actually coincide in a striking number of ways. In this installment of NPR's \"Parallel Lives\" series, a look at Obama's time at their shared alma mater. Harvard professor Laurence Tribe is a sort of legal rock star, particularly among liberals. First-year law students he has never met don't just show up at his door saying, \"I want to work for you.\" At least they didn't until March 31, 1989. Tribe recently retrieved his daily calendar from that year and pointed to the entry for the last day in March. Just above reminders for \"Haircut?\" and \"Write US Atty,\" it says, \"11 am: Barack Obama (1L),\" indicating that this was a first-year law student. Harvard professor Laurence Tribe's calendar for March 31, 1989, marks his first meeting with future President Barack Obama. The exclamation point was to remind Tribe how impressed he was with the first-year law student.\n                \n                    \n                    Ari Shapiro/NPR\n                    \n                \nhide caption Harvard professor Laurence Tribe's calendar for March 31, 1989, marks his first meeting with future President Barack Obama. The exclamation point was to remind Tribe how impressed he was with the first-year law student. \"And then it has a phone number, which I guess is his dorm room,\" Tribe pointed out, \"and there's an exclamation point next to it.\" That was to remind Tribe how impressed he was by this skinny kid in jeans, a sweatshirt and an afro. Obama's Harvard Law School education set him on a path to national prominence. And although likely Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney sometimes attacks Obama for having \"spent too much time at Harvard,\" the school is one thing the men have in common. Obama arrived on the law school campus 20 years after Romney earned a joint degree from the law school and the business school. Like Romney, Obama was older than the typical student. While Romney spent time as a Mormon missionary in France before Harvard, Obama worked as a community organizer in Chicago. When Obama arrived on campus, Tribe says it was clear that \"he wanted to make a difference. He wanted to learn how the system worked.\" Finding Common Ground Their first conversation lasted hours, and Obama went on to work for Tribe on articles and books, including one called Abortion: The Clash of Absolutes. Tribe recalls that his research assistant tried to find a way out of deeply entrenched lines of the abortion debate, focusing instead on education and access to birth control. \"It's as though he was looking not just for a point in the middle of a spectrum, but for a line that was perpendicular, so that one could get outside the tragic choice.\" The two have remained close, with Tribe serving as a mentor and informal adviser to the president over the years. Professor Charles Ogletree plays a similar role in Obama's life. In 1989, Ogletree taught a non-credit Saturday course to give first-year students a basic set of skills in law school. Ogletree remembers the student who always arrived on time, sat in the front row, and was professorial almost to a fault. After answering the question, Obama would say, \"But Al, who talked earlier, had a very good point when he said X. And Sarah, I think she really captured it when she said Y. And if you think about Latoya, her analysis was ...\" at which point Ogletree would interject, \"Barack, I'm teaching this class, not you!\" He seemed to know who he was, be very grounded. Harvard classmate Ken Mack That might sound like the arrogance Obama is sometimes accused of, but to Ogletree it sounded like this student was trying to bring everyone into the conversation. Bridge-Builder And Trash Talker Even then, classmate Ken Mack recalls, Obama stood apart. Mack is now a professor at Harvard Law School and author of the book Representing the Race: The Creation of the Civil Rights Lawyer. \"He seemed to know who he was, be very grounded,\" says Mack. There was no sign of the kid people used to call \"Barry.\" \"If you would've told me that someone had called him Barry, I would have been surprised. Barry is a little bit diminutive \u2014 that would not have fit him at all,\" Mack says. After class on the basketball court, a whole different personality emerged. The conciliating bridge-builder was replaced by the trash-talker with a left-handed jump shot. Obama played every chance he could get, including on the black law students' association team. One day the team agreed to play Walpole prison. Obama was the starting center, standing face to face with his much bigger opponent. \"And so Barack started the game by the usual embracing, good luck, what are you in here for?\" says Ogletree. The inmate replied, \"Double murder.\" \"Barack played no defense at all that game. Didn't shoot any of his traditional jump shots,\" says Ogletree, laughing. \"That's the only time that Barack Obama, in my knowledge, didn't talk trash, either then or now, about basketball.\" Taking The Lead By the end of Obama's second year, his academic record and reputation had qualified him to run for one of the most prestigious roles at the law school \u2014 president of the Harvard Law Review. The review editors were a partisan, contentious group. Classmate Brad Berenson remembers the guy from Hawaii who floated above the fray. \"One of the enduring images I have of him is of a guy in jeans and a leather jacket, Jimmy Dean style, standing out in front of Gannett House smoking a cigarette.\" Berenson was one of the conservatives, and in a long, contentious election, his group ultimately supported Obama's candidacy. \"They did that in part because they had a sense that he was more open-minded and would listen to the conservatives, and would value and accept their contributions in a way that some of the other candidates would not,\" says Berenson, who worked in the George W. Bush White House and is now a member of Romney's justice advisory committee. Mitt Romney already had a young family during his time at Harvard \u2014 one of several things that set him apart from most students. Find out more about his time at Harvard in another installment of \"Parallel Lives.\" The conservatives' intuition turned out to be correct, says Berenson. \"He ended up upsetting many more of his colleagues on the far left than those of us who were on the right, in part because the bottom line for him as president of the law review always remained putting out a first-class publication.\" 'An Honest Grade' Being the first black president of the Harvard Law Review had perks. Obama received national media attention and a book deal. By the time he was ready to leave Cambridge, Mass., every door was open to him. Mack, Obama's classmate, remembers walking back from Harvard Square getting a bite to eat with his friend. \"Everyone knew he could clerk for the Supreme Court, get a high-paying law firm job, at least make a lot of money for a couple of years before he went off and did something else,\" Mack says. \"And he said that he had decided that he wasn't going to clerk, and he wanted to go back to Chicago and just get started in the work that he wanted to do with his life.\" In Chicago, the newly minted lawyer with a Harvard degree returned to community organizing work, and eventually a political career. Ogletree never imagined that his student would become the first African-American in the Oval Office. \"My assessment was ... that he was going to be the best damn mayor that we've ever seen in history.\" Obama recently joked about that assessment with his old friend and mentor, asking, \"Man, why did you downgrade me?\" Ogletree replied: \"It wasn't a downgrade. It was an honest grade.\" In a previous part of the \"Parallel Lives\" series, Ari Shapiro explored Mitt Romney's years at Harvard.",

Republicans rule rural areas, while any Democrat can count on running up big margins in most of the large cities in the country. That has left the suburbs as the main partisan battleground. For several election cycles now, the presidency has been won or lost based on the vote among suburbanites in a few key states. That's likely to be true again this November. And some political observers believe that President Obama took the calculated risk that his newfound support for gay marriage rights will boost his campaign in these all-important counties. Suburbanites tend to be liberal to moderate on social issues. Obama's stance in favor of same-sex marriage, combined with Republican attacks on birth control and abortion, could hurt all-but-official GOP nominee Mitt Romney among suburbanites, some observers say. \"Gay marriage is more dangerous in moderate swing suburban communities for the Republicans than it is for the Democrats,\" says Lawrence Levy, executive dean of the National Center for Suburban Studies at Hofstra University. \"The mistake Republicans have made with suburban voters is expecting that they're like Republicans in red communities.\" As the nation's older, inner-ring suburbs have grown denser and more diverse, they have also become more Democratic. Large counties that used to be favorable territory for Republicans \u2014 such as Fairfax County, Va., outside Washington, D.C., and Nassau County, N.Y., on Long Island \u2014 are now rich sources of Democratic votes. Obama's victory in 2008 came about partly thanks to his ability to dominate larger suburban counties in states such as Colorado, Ohio and Pennsylvania. And he became the first Democrat to carry Virginia since 1964 by running up good-sized margins in the populous suburbs outside Washington, D.C. But while Levy expects Obama's support for gay marriage to play well in many suburban areas, he doesn't expect it to override other issues of primary concern \u2014 most notably, the economy. \"This issue, for most suburban voters, is going to be way, way, way down the list of priorities,\" says Whit Ayres, a Republican political consultant. \"Suburban voters are going to be voting overwhelmingly on the economy, jobs, spending and debt.\" The gay-marriage issue, meanwhile, is likely to help Romney among rural and religious voters \u2014 strongly Republican constituencies that have been less than wildly enthusiastic about his campaign. \"The one negative consequence of this for Obama is that this could increase energy and support from the core groups that Romney needs for election,\" says Frank Newport, editor-in-chief at Gallup, the polling organization. Denser And Democratic Even in North Carolina, where voters overwhelmingly approved a ban on gay marriage Tuesday, several of the state's most populous counties, such as Wake, Mecklenburg and Durham, voted against the ban. Even if you can make the case that suburbanites live in the most segregated places, they are turned off by any overt display of bias. That doesn't fit their image of themselves. Lawrence Levy, National Center for Suburban Studies, Hofstra University \"I think the White House looked at that vote and decided it was a finally safe to go out into the water,\" says Henry Olsen, vice president of the American Enterprise Institute, a conservative think tank. \"This is potentially a wedge issue among moderate suburbanites nationwide.\" Recent polling by the Pew Research Center shows that residents of the suburbs support gay marriage, though not overwhelmingly so. Forty-eight percent of suburbanites are in favor of gay marriage, compared with 41 percent who are opposed. By comparison, 53 percent of rural Americans are opposed to gay marriage, and 36 percent in favor of its legality. \"Even if you can make the case that suburbanites live in the most segregated places, they are turned off by any overt display of bias,\" says Levy, the Hofstra scholar. \"That doesn't fit their image of themselves.\" Dollar-A-Year Men Still, when asked about the salience of same-sex marriage, suburbanites \u2014 like just about everyone else \u2014 rank it pretty low on the list. Ayres, the GOP consultant, suggests that gay marriage, like student loans, represents an attempt by the White House to appeal directly to particular constituencies. Gays make up a crucial share of Obama's top campaign donors. Since the president announced his support for gay marriage on Wednesday, social media sites have been buzzing with gays and others announcing fresh campaign donations. Many have posted, for instance, about their decision to give $1 to Obama's campaign for every year of a committed relationship \u2014 their own or a loved one's. \"Politically, this looks like a concerted strategy by the president and his team to gin up support among elements of his coalition that are not particularly energized about his campaign,\" Ayres says. \"He's doing it because he's losing independents left and right because of the lousy economy and his handling of it.\" The Battle Out West In Colorado \u2014 widely considered one of the main battleground states this year \u2014 voters six years ago approved a ban on gay marriage. In 1992, they voted to block the state and municipalities from affording gays basic rights in areas such as housing and employment \u2014 a measure that was later overturned by the U.S. Supreme Court. But support for gay marriage has grown in Colorado, as elsewhere, and is now a \"50-50\" proposition in the state, says Denver-based pollster Floyd Ciruli. \"Like the nation, we have evolved,\" he says. Colorado's regular legislative session ended Tuesday with a bill to allow gays to enter into civil unions blocked through procedural maneuvers. But Democratic Gov. John Hickenlooper has called a special session, starting Monday, to deal with civil unions and other matters. \"I consciously try to avoid divisive issues that are intensely polarizing,\" Hickenlooper said Thursday. \"That being said, when it comes down to civil rights, you don't really have a choice.\" Ciruli predicts that Republicans will have a hard time using the issue effectively against Democrats in the Denver suburbs, saying the issue lacks the sort of \"bite\" it once had. On the other hand, he doesn't expect gay marriage to be a big political winner for Obama or other Democrats, either. \"In the suburbs, unless you are really into gay rights, this doesn't seem like one of the biggest issues,\" Ciruli says. \"We're so utterly consumed by the economy.\"",

For the past two weeks, the campaigns of both President Obama and GOP rival Mitt Romney have accused each other of waging a war on women. But what's really going on is a war for women's votes. The president, like Democrats before him, has an advantage with female voters \u2014 who make up 53 percent of the American electorate. Romney is trying to close the gender gap by using his most powerful and popular surrogate: his wife. \"I've had the fun of being out with my wife the last several days on the campaign trail, and she points out that as she talks to women, they tell her that their No. 1 concern is the economy,\" Romney has said. Ann Romney is a warm, natural presence on the stump, and she has become Mitt Romney's No. 1 ambassador to female voters. The Boston Globe's Michael Kranish, co-author of the book The Real Romney, says Ann Romney is even more than that. \"Ann Romney has always been a big asset for Mitt, really to humanize him. He has had trouble connecting with the average voter really since he first got in public life,\" Kranish says. \"And she has provided a real softening for him and a human touch. ... I think the way Mitt Romney sees it is that she is a woman and that she will innately understand the needs and concerns of women more than he will.\" Attack And Counterattack The Romney campaign was thrilled last week when Ann Romney became the subject of a big misfire from Democratic strategist Hilary Rosen, who said Romney's wife had \"actually never worked a day in her life.\" The Obama camp was put on the defensive for an attack on a well-liked woman who has raised five boys and struggled with breast cancer and multiple sclerosis. But then Ann Romney was overheard crowing about the political benefits \u2014 she called it an early birthday gift to be attacked as a mother. \"That was really a defining moment and I loved it,\" she said. The next day, she had to explain herself on ABC News. \"That wasn't how I meant it. It was a birthday gift to me because I love the fact that we're talking about this,\" she said. By \"this,\" Ann Romney said, she meant the economy. But other Republicans aren't shy about touting the upside of the attack on Mrs. Romney. \"It was dismissive. It was arrogant,\" says Republican pollster Linda DiVall. \"It was unbelievably shocking to hear another woman talk about Ann Romney in such a way, and I think that is something that really registered with women across the country.\" A Larger Conversation? Over time, DiVall predicts, that will help Mitt Romney. But right now the gender gap looks pretty durable. A CNN poll taken after the controversy shows the president still beating Romney by 16 points with women, a much bigger margin than Romney's advantage with men. But it's very early in the race. Nonpartisan pollster J. Ann Selzer says Romney has an opening with women but needs to do more. \"It will only have an effect if it links up to something more substantive,\" she says. \"Is there a bigger conversation about women's role in the economy?\" Republican Rep. Cathy McMorris Rodgers of Washington, a surrogate for the Romney campaign, says yes. That bigger conversation with women is about health care, debt and taxes. \"When you look at the number of women that are starting businesses at a record pace, they understand regulations and taxes and tax burden,\" she says. \"As the Republicans can continue to remind women of why they oppose ... the policies that have been driven by President Obama ... [women] will look favorably on the Republican approach.\" McMorris Rodgers says Obama's policies fueled women's swing to the GOP in 2010 \u2014 the first time Republicans won the women's vote in 30 years. But since then, women have swung back to the president. Different Focuses While Romney focuses on macro issues like the deficit and jobs \u2014 where he is the strongest \u2014 the Obama campaign is focusing on micro issues like contraception or Romney's promise to get rid of Planned Parenthood. Those issues, says Obama deputy campaign manager Stephanie Cutter, drove female voters away from the Republicans this year. \"The gender gap wasn't created out of nowhere. It was created because they have systematically, over the course of the last year-and-a-half of Mitt Romney running, seen him move away [from] or undermine issues that they care about,\" Cutter says. So while Romney figures out the best way to ease the gender gap, the president is continuing to do what he can to maintain it \u2014 with frequent events aimed at women.",

Chris O'Brien, state grass-roots organizer for former Republican presidential candidate Rick Santorum, holds a sign reading \"Convince Me!\" outside a Romney campaign stop in Hartford, Conn., on April 11. There's been hand-wringing in some Republican quarters since Rick Santorum dropped out of the race for the party's presidential nomination, leaving an open path for Mitt Romney to take on President Obama in the fall. How will Romney bring around the party's skeptical evangelical base? What work does he need to do within the party as he pivots to a full-on general election battle with Obama? For advice, we called on politicos who perhaps know candidate Romney, the 2012 version, best: those who worked for and advised some of his opponents in the as-good-as-over race for the GOP crown. Their nearly uniform don't-look-back suggestions don't discount Romney's need to bring his base along for the ride. But if the former Massachusetts governor can prove he can compete hard against the president \u2014 and better than GOP nominee Sen. John McCain did in 2008 \u2014 the votes, they predict, will be there come fall. Here's what they told us: Don't 'Go Down That Rat Hole.' Jim Innocenzi of Sandler-Innocenzi, an adviser to Texas Gov. Rick Perry's presidential campaign, advises Romney not to get distracted by side issues like contraception. \"The primary's in the rearview mirror. I'm sure that those [Romney] guys are now focused on Obama just like Obama is focusing on them. That's the smartest thing to do. If you pick up and listen to some of the conservative talk folks, they may not be as thrilled with Romney as someone else, but they're less thrilled with Obama. \"I'm not one to say that the sky is falling \u2014 there are some out there who are nervous Nellies about everything. There are problems, yes, and I don't mean to minimize them, but there are issues Romney can use to his advantage. Like the economy, jobs. The fundamental hurdle is not to be distracted by issues that don't matter, like contraceptives. If they go down that rat hole, they have a problem. \"All those people are welcome in the Romney tent. He's not going to stiff them, not going to give them the Heisman.\" 'If You Build It, The Base Will Come.' Chris Allen, national political director for former Utah Gov. Jon Huntsman's presidential campaign, says die-hard conservatives will mobilize behind Romney to defeat President Obama. \"Gov. Romney has an incredible team who [have] been preparing for several years to take on the president \u2014 now that the rest of the Republican field is out of the way, it is time to adhere to their original game plan for November. \"I think that conservative skepticism will naturally and quickly fall away now that Gov. Romney will be the nominee. The choice all along this cycle to far-right conservatives has been between a nominee they agree 100 percent with who has almost no chance in the general, or a nominee that they can agree 80 percent with who has the ability to appeal to independents and actually win in November. \"At this point, it is a 'if you build it, the base will come' mentality \u2014 whether they are 100 percent behind you or not, what is clear is that they are focused on defeating the president. Now that the dust is settling, it is hard for me to imagine a day when a die-hard conservative doesn't walk into that voting booth this November and vote against the president.\" Go 'Nose To Nose' With Obama. Craig Murphy of San Jacinto Public Affairs in Austin, which advised the Perry presidential campaign, says taking on the president will help eliminate conservative concerns. \"He can now focus on Obama, on going nose-to-nose with Obama. That's what the conservative base wants anyway. The more effective he is at doing that, the more they're going to like him. \"Going to conservatives and saying 'I'm not as bad as I once was' is just not going to work. That strategy would make no sense to anyone. What do conservatives want? They want him to defeat Obama. \"The Republican primary has a very conservative base of people, and essentially he has won. We just happened to have started in the field with a series of polls in parts of Texas, and Romney is crushing everyone else \u2014 we'd never seen anyone with more than 50 percent, even with Perry in the field. Romney is now breaking 60 in different parts of the state. \"If he's blowing everybody out in Texas, which is one of the most conservative states, then he's made his case successfully and now needs to generate enthusiasm for November by standing up to Obama and intellectually challenging him on the issues. If there was a knock on him during the primaries, it was that we don't need another McCain. As he demonstrates that he can engage Obama, and challenge him effectively, that will eliminate the last remaining concerns among some conservatives.\" Convince Americans On Key Issues. J.D. Gordon, spokesman for the presidential campaign of former pizza company CEO Herman Cain, says Romney should prove he can handle key factors like the unemployment rate, gas prices and health care. \"Gov. Romney is in good shape heading into the general election. He has essentially wrapped up the nomination two months earlier in the process than President Obama did in 2008. \"He can focus his full attention on comparing and contrasting his vision for America with President Obama's record over the past three years. \"As we've seen throughout the GOP primary process, national polls change often. Therefore I wouldn't say that President Obama has any advantage at this point in time. \"Key factors in the November election will be the national unemployment rate, gas prices, the fate of Obamacare, and a wide variety of national security-related crises that may come up between now and then. As long as Gov. Romney can convince Americans that he will do a better job than President Obama on these issues, he has an excellent chance of becoming our president.\"",

            "article_content": "1 of 11 Despite falling short in the quest for the Republican presidential nomination, former Pennsylvania Sen. Rick Santorum has established himself as one of the dominant conservative voices in America, particularly when it comes to social issues such as abortion and birth control. Santorum announced Tuesday that he is suspending his quest for the presidency. Santorum ultimately chose to suspend his campaign ahead of the April 24 primary in Pennsylvania. A loss on his political home turf would have done serious damage to his future electoral prospects. \"We made the decision over the weekend [that] this presidential race is over for me, and we will suspend our campaign today,\" Santorum said at a news conference in Gettysburg, Pa., flanked by members of his family. Santorum had taken a break from campaigning in recent days owing to his-3-year-old daughter Bella's hospitalization and the Easter holiday. Bella was released Monday night. But despite having trailed well behind Mitt Romney, a former Massachusetts governor who is now the presumptive GOP nominee, Santorum has \"now made himself a national figure,\" says Rogers Smith, a University of Pennsylvania political scientist. \"He has established himself as the most credible voice and the leader of the social conservative wing of the party.\" It's not clear whether Santorum will immediately endorse Romney, whom he has criticized as a weak potential opponent against President Obama. But Santorum has said in recent weeks that he will support the party's nominee. Santorum didn't mention Romney at his news conference but vowed to \"continue to fight to defeat President Obama\" and help Republicans in Congress. \"This game is a long way from over,\" Santorum said. Santorum bows his head in prayer during a campaign rally in the basement of the Northwestern Bank building in Orange City, Iowa, on Jan. 1.\n                \n                    \n                    Scott Olson/Getty Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption Santorum bows his head in prayer during a campaign rally in the basement of the Northwestern Bank building in Orange City, Iowa, on Jan. 1. \"We won more counties than all the other people in this race combined,\" Santorum said of his underdog campaign. \"I found a deeper love for this country.\" From Out Of Nowhere Santorum spent most of the year leading up to the primary season as a virtual nonfactor in the race, polling well behind Romney and other Republican hopefuls. That Santorum could come this far and remain standing well into the spring as the primary conservative challenger against Romney are circumstances almost no one would have predicted as late as last December. \"I kept saying at the time, 'What is he doing in this race?' because he got 3 percent consistently, in poll after poll,\" says J. Ann Selzer, a pollster in Iowa. But Santorum went on to win the caucuses in Iowa, the first contest of the campaign. He carried 11 states in all and, although he wasn't able to knock Romney off his throne, he was able to give him a scare from time to time. \"He aimed his message firmly at his intended base, which was religious conservatives,\" says former Pennsylvania Republican Rep. Phil English, who has known Santorum since college. \"He invested all of his time upfront in his greatest area of strength, which is grass-roots campaigning.\" Santorum's Future Santorum stayed in the race well past the point when most Republicans \u2014 including many ardent conservatives \u2014 had called for him and the other remaining candidates to concede and fall in line behind Romney. Santorum may have hoped to gain enough delegates to remain viable if lightning would have struck \u2014 or at least to have leverage to push Romney to adopt conservative positions more to his liking. Even though Santorum had come under pressure to call it quits, there was no advantage for him in doing so, says Henry Olsen, vice president of the American Enterprise Institute, a conservative think tank. \"Every time he went to a state, even if he didn't win, he built up a network,\" Olsen says. \"Why should he have cut that short to curry favor with the big-money people lined up behind Romney, who aren't going to like him in four years anyway?\" Social Conservative Strength Should Romney lose, the question Santorum will face going forward is whether to try to broaden his own message and appeal, or remain, as Olsen calls him, \"the paladin of the social conservatives.\" Santorum single-handedly resurrected the GOP's social conservative wing as a force to be reckoned with, Olsen argues. It had gone a bit dormant in favor of fiscal conservatives in response to budget deficits under President Obama and broader economic issues. Support from key social conservative leaders in Iowa such as Bob Vander Plaats, president of Family Leader, helped elevate Santorum there. Despite poor showings in other early contests \u2014 Santorum finished fourth in New Hampshire and third in South Carolina \u2014 religious conservatives elsewhere came to embrace him as their champion. \"Of all the candidates, he was the one who resonated most with certain segments of the Republican electorate,\" says Terry Madonna, a political scientist at Franklin & Marshall College in Lancaster, Pa. \"They were his rock,\" Madonna says. \"They kept him in the race while others came and went.\" Regional Appeal But Santorum found himself trapped in a \"demographic box,\" as Madonna puts it. He won support among evangelicals, rural voters and those with low levels of income and education. His victories came mainly in Southern states or more rural parts of the Midwest and Rocky Mountain states. But he was unable to win in larger, more diverse states. Throughout the Midwest, Santorum looked like he might threaten Romney, but instead he lost in state after state: Michigan, Ohio, Illinois and, last week, Wisconsin. Those losses undermined one of the main rationales of Santorum's campaign. Throughout the early days of the race, Santorum bragged about his ability to appeal to swing voters in big, industrial states, having represented Pennsylvania in Congress for 16 years. But Santorum had lost his 2006 re-election bid by 17 points. That was one big reason he spent 2011 watching nearly every other candidate climb ahead of him in the polls. Santorum leaves a campaign stop at the Daily Grind coffee shop in Sioux City, Iowa, on Jan. 1.\n                \n                    \n                    Scott Olson/Getty Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption Santorum leaves a campaign stop at the Daily Grind coffee shop in Sioux City, Iowa, on Jan. 1. \"If it weren't for his 17-point loss in his last Senate campaign in Pennsylvania, he would have emerged sooner as the leading voice of the social conservatives,\" says Smith, the Penn political scientist. Double-Edged Support There were various reasons Santorum kept losing to Romney in the clutch. Romney enjoyed huge advantages in terms of fundraising and organizational strength. Through much of the race, Santorum was living on fumes, lacking even a physical address for his national headquarters. But Santorum's direct appeals to social conservatives, while helping to shore up their support, also limited his ability to win over other voters, says Smith. Santorum seemed to line up against broader public opinion on certain issues, including his remarks that a speech by John F. Kennedy extolling the separation of church and state \"makes me throw up.\" On the eve of the Michigan primary, Santorum also called Obama a \"snob\" because he wants \"everybody in America to go to college.\" Not A Bridge-Builder These were not new sentiments for Santorum, who was known for courting controversy in the Senate. There, he was a leader in the fights to ban late abortion and create a constitutional ban on same-sex marriage and emerged as a favorite target for liberals. \"He didn't approach his campaigns at the crucial moments as someone who could bridge the various divisions of the Republican Party,\" says Olsen, the AEI scholar. \"He presented himself as the champion of one of them.\" Santorum may have a bright future as a conservative commentator and speechmaker or activist. If he chooses to seek the presidency again \u2014 and he's only 53 \u2014 the question he'll face is whether he can broaden his appeal beyond the social conservative base that revived his political career. \"The same things that put him forward for the runner-up status for the Republican nomination have effectively reduced his credibility in a general election,\" says English, the former representative, who is backing Romney.",

With the possibility that women voters might prove decisive in November's presidential election, each major party is obviously looking for opportunities to argue why its policies are better for women and the opposition's worse. The latest came Friday with the release of the March jobless figures. The report was a surprise on the downside because the economy added far fewer jobs for the month \u2014 121,000 \u2014 than economists had forecast even as the jobless rate declined a tenth of a percentage point to 8.2 percent. The disappointing number reinforced a vexing trend that has shown up in the Labor Department data for months. During the current recovery, women have failed to regain jobs at anywhere near a rate comparable to men. It's a potential political problem for the president which the GOP would like to exploit. Which helps explain a Friday White House forum on \"women and the economy,\" and the president's appearance at same, to highlight policies meant to eventually improve the economic lot of women. Obama said: \"Right now, no issue is more important than restoring economic security for all our families in the wake of the greatest economic crisis since the Great Depression. And that begins with making sure everyone who wants a job has one.\" While the president did talk about the uneven progress on the jobs front, his appearance at the forum allowed him to discuss a range of other policies he hopes will give him stronger appeal to women voters than the likely Republican nominee, Mitt Romney. His litany included his support for pay equity, highlighted by his signing of the Lilly Ledbetter Act early in his administration and the Affordable Care Act with requirement that the health insurance plans employers offer include contraception coverage with no out-of-pocket costs to employees. That many of those who want jobs but can't find them are women was seized on by Republican National Committee co-chair Sharon Day who said in a statement: \"President Obama and his fellow Democrats love to say they stand for women, but women can no longer stand the Obama economy. Women deserve better, and in November we will hold him accountable.\" The problem women are having finding jobs relative to men is particularly baffling for many economists because it doesn't seem to be simply an issue of a rebound in industries where men traditionally predominate, like construction and manufacturing. Instead, the phenomenon is being observed within industries with large numbers of workers of both genders. Heidi Shierholz, an economist at the Economic Policy Institute, a pro-labor Washington think tank, said that during the depth of the Great Recession when jobs were being lost at a terrifying rate, December 2007 to February 2010, men lost 69 percent of the jobs while women lost 31 percent of them. Since then, she said, men got 76 percent of the job gains while women have only gotten 24 percent. \"It is catching people's eyes for sure that men are getting a disproportionate number of jobs,\" Shierholz said. She was quick to add, however, that it shouldn't be forgotten that men took a bigger hit in terms of job loss during the recession, so much so that it was called a \"mancession.\" Aparna Mathur, an economist at the conservative American Enterprise Institute, theorized that there was something of an industry effect at play, with the earliest wave of layoffs hitting sectors with more male workers while layoffs of women lagged behind. Now in the the recovery, the same pattern is at play, she said, with women lagging behind in job gains. In any event, she said she specific federal policies targeted at women weren't needed. \"If we just create the right environment for businesses to start functioning and to start hiring, all of the effects on the women will disappear over time. You will see women being rehired. You will see women getting back into the labor force.\" The release of Friday's jobs report, with its continued sobering news about women and jobs, came against a backdrop of what's being called the gender gap. Issues like the partisan fight over contraception coverage or Planned Parenthood have allowed Democrats to accuse Republicans of a \"war on women.\" Those attacks have, at least according to a recent USA Today/Gallup Poll, helped Obama open an 18-point lead on Romney in 12 swing states. Republicans accuse Obama of cynically using scare tactics. \"The Obama campaign and the DNC have attempted to deflect how their policies are affecting women by their extreme rhetoric,\" said Sean Spicer, an RNC spokesman.",

            "article_content": "Roughly half the delegates to the GOP nominating convention have now been chosen, and Mitt Romney has emerged as the prohibitive favorite \u2014 eager to lead the party against President Obama. So how does he use the next five months until the convention begins?  RENEE MONTAGNE, HOST: Joining us for some analysis of last night's results and a look at the presidential contest ahead is NPR political correspondent Mara Liasson. Good morning. MARA LIASSON, BYLINE: Good morning, Renee. MONTAGNE: Clearly another good night for Mitt Romney, especially when it came to the delegate count. What exactly has he won? LIASSON: Well, I think this is more than the turning point for Romney. I think he really gets to say very convincingly to the Republican Party that this race is effectively over. He picked up 16 delegates in Washington, D.C., where Santorum wasn't even on the ballot. He got most of the 37 delegates in Maryland, and about three-quarters of the 42 delegates at stake in Wisconsin. So he lengthened his overall delegate lead over Santorum, which was already at a two-to-one ratio. MONTAGNE: And Rick Santorum has said he will not quit, that May will be a better month for him, he'll come back and prove Romney's not strong enough to be the nominee. Any chance the party elders will talk him out of that vow? LIASSON: Well, it's hard to see that happening now, but Santorum needs more than 70 percent of the delegates that remain, and that's just not mathematically possible. Now, he has talked about his home state of Pennsylvania as being a do or die race, just like his supporters were saying in David Welna's piece. I think that it's possible that if he loses Pennsylvania, maybe he would get out of the race. Even if he wins Pennsylvania, he probably wouldn't get more than half of the delegates there. And don't forget, on that same day Republicans in New York, Connecticut, Rhode Island and Delaware vote, and those are all great states for Mitt Romney. MONTAGNE: Well, why does Rick Santorum keep on running? I mean, can he keep winning in a way that matters? LIASSON: Well, not that matters in getting the 1,144 delegates that you need for the nomination or stopping Romney from getting there. He could win in Arkansas and Kentucky. He could win in Texas. But then again, there's California and New Jersey coming up and those are Romney-friendly states. He might think that he can run his way onto the ticket. Or maybe he'll do what Newt Gingrich and Ron Paul are doing, which is staying in the race officially, but not really contesting the primaries very seriously. MONTAGNE: So Mitt Romney, as we heard last night, is now very much focused on the fall election. That is to say, he has pretty well swung around to seeing his opponent as the president. What about that? LIASSON: Well, I think you're right. I don't think that he's going to be spending much time talking about the other Republicans in the race. He barely mentions them as it is. As Ari Shapiro just said, he's going to be here in Washington today talking to newspaper editors, the same ones that President Obama talked to yesterday, where he mentioned Romney by name. I think you'll hear the same kind of counter-attack by Romney against the president. So the fall campaign really has begun. You heard the president talking about Republicans and Romney as social Darwinists. You heard Romney last night talking about the president as out of touch, wanting a government-centered society. I think that the White House certainly hopes that some of the negative impressions from the primary about Romney are indelible, but it's possible that Eric Fehrnstrom, Romney's top aid, had a point when he made that Etch-a-sketch comment. You know, winners of hard-fought primary battles do get a shave and a haircut, they get a fresh look. There are lots of voters who haven't been paying tremendous attention to the race. And you're also hearing Romney change the tone of his remarks on immigration, on contraception. He clearly is starting the traditional move to the center, trying to repair the damage that the primary race has done for him with Hispanics and women. So the general election is underway. MONTAGNE: So just one last thought. The whole question of a convention fight, or a decision made at the convention, what do you think? Where does that stand now? LIASSON: I think that's not in cards. I think the convention will be what it normally is, which is a four-day infomercial for the nominee, and I don't see how Rick Santorum gets the delegates that will allow him to mount that kind of contest on the convention floor against Romney. MONTAGNE: Mara, thanks very much. LIASSON: Thank you, Renee. MONTAGNE: That's NPR's national political correspondent, Mara Liasson. Copyright \u00a9 2012 NPR.  All rights reserved.

As U.S. Supreme Court justices opened their historic three-day hearing of arguments on President Obama's health care plan, hundreds of protesters from across the country flocked outside the court singing, chanting and arguing with one another. Supporters and opponents of the law engaged in a sing-song call-and-response debate just in front of the court's towering marble steps. Listen Live At 8 p.m. Monday: The Supreme Court has wrapped the first day of oral arguments on the fate of the health care law. Tune in tonight for news and analysis from NPR's Nina Totenberg, Julie Rovner, Ari Shapiro and more. \"We love Obamacare!\" shouted supporters. \"No, we don't!\" responded members of the Tea Party Patriots, one of the most vocal and disapproving groups of the law present at the court Monday. Sometimes the exchanges became personal. Like when an opponent of the health care law shouted, \"Real women buy their own birth control\" to marching supporters who emphatically replied, \"We are real women.\" Others debated the constitutionality of the law, which would require most Americans to purchase health insurance by 2014 or pay a penalty. Opponents of the law, like Jenny Beth Martin, the co-founder of Tea Party Patriots, say it's an example of government encroaching on individual liberties. \"This is about whether we are going to be in control of our lives, and in charge of the decisions that affect our lives, or whether the government is going to come in and control those decisions,\" Martin said. Ken Campbell, a dentist from California who's also a member of the Tea Party Patriots, agrees. Even as a medical professional, he says, he's not comfortable with \"the government mandating \u2014 just by us merely existing \u2014 by us breathing that we have to buy health care.\" However, plenty of doctors in favor of the law also stood outside the court. Wearing their stark white lab coats, they chanted: \"Protect our care, protect our law.\" Some of them, like Cameron Page, weren't always fans of the law. But now he sees greater evils: \"You know what makes me more uncomfortable [is] unnecessary brain surgery, or people dying in the ICU [intensive care unit] when they could have just gotten a prescription a couple weeks earlier and stayed healthy.\"",

Mary Beth Kopidlansky of  Waukesha says she knows who she'll vote for in Wisconsin's upcoming GOP  presidential primary (Mitt Romney), but that's not really what she's interested  in talking about. full results For Kopidlansky, and most  potential voters in this most Republican of Wisconsin counties, the contest that  is consuming them and the rest of the state is not the state's April 3  presidential primary when 42 potentially crucial delegates will be  awarded. The real race here is  scheduled for June 5, when Democrats will attempt to wrest the governorship from  first-term GOP Gov. Scott Walker in a recall election sparked by anti-union  legislation he championed last year. \"Walker has totally  polarized the state,\" said Kopidlansky, 62, a conservative-leaning independent,  after wrapping up lunch Tuesday in downtown Waukesha's Taylor's People's Park  restaurant. \"It's now all black and  white,\" she says. The deep passion generated  by the recall and the tepid enthusiasm here for the GOP slate of presidential  candidates has conspired to make the presidential contest almost an  afterthought, even though the winner-take-all  prize could prove  crucial in Romney's push to extinguish opponent Rick Santorum's  campaign. Volunteers at the Wisconsin Democratic Party's recall office in Waukesha entered names from petitions to recall Gov. Scott Walker into their voter databases on March 20.\n                \n                    \n                    Liz Halloran/NPR\n                    \n                \nhide caption Volunteers at the Wisconsin Democratic Party's recall office in Waukesha entered names from petitions to recall Gov. Scott Walker into their voter databases on March 20. Jeni Badertscher, 54,  offered a process-of-elimination response that proved typical of those served up  by Waukesha Republicans when asked whom they planned to vote for in the  presidential primary. \"I haven't yet decided,  actually,\" Badertscher said, pausing. \"But not Gingrich, he turns  me off, so overbearing,\" she said. \"Probably Romney,\" she  said. \"Or maybe Santorum.\" Wrapping it up: \"Bottom  line, it's who's going to do the best job and get Obama out.\" Gingrich doesn't plan to  make a play for Badertscher's vote; neither he nor Ron Paul has any organization  in the state, GOP officials say. Santorum, who after his post-Illinois  drubbing, is focusing on Louisiana's March 24 primary and his home state of  Pennsylvania a month later, also has next-to-nothing in the way of organization  but will appear Saturday at an Americans for Prosperity Forum in  Milwaukee. His campaign has also  reached out to the Wisconsin Faith and Freedom Coalition about its March 30  event that is scheduled to feature former Attorney General Alberto Gonzales and  national Faith and Freedom Coalition founder Ralph Reed. Romney, who has the money and the  organization, is expected to open an office in Waukesha County soon. He is seen  by most as the odds-on favorite to win in the white-collar, educated county  crucial to any statewide GOP victory. Santorum's social  conservatism and his restrictive views on contraception and reproductive rights are  less appealing to most Waukesha County Republicans, including Dave Bauer,  71. Mary Beth Kopidlansky, 62, of Waukesha says she'll vote for Mitt Romney in Wisconsin's GOP presidential primary because \"he's a very moral man.\n                \n                    \n                    Liz Halloran/NPR\n                    \n                \nhide caption Mary Beth Kopidlansky, 62, of Waukesha says she'll vote for Mitt Romney in Wisconsin's GOP presidential primary because \"he's a very moral man. \"I don't know how any woman  could vote for him,\" said Bauer, who favors Gingrich in the race. Indeed, in the next-door state of Illinois on Tuesday, women favored Romney over Santorum, 46 to 37 percent, according to CNN's exit polls. (Romney also won among men, 48 to 33 percent.) At Waukesha County  Republican headquarters, where volunteers work to keep Walker in  office, executive director Cathy Waller acknowledged that the focus on women's  health and reproductive issues has not been helpful to the party, and doesn't  reflect local concerns. \"Women here are just not  talking about that,\" Waller said. \"Our priority is jobs, and we need to get back  on track.\" Because as Republicans here  know, President Obama's massive re-election effort has already come to downtown  Waukesha, with an Organizing for America office just a block or two away from  the Wisconsin Democrats' \"Recall Walker\" office. The OFA office has four  paid staffers, a slew of volunteers, and a message that will no doubt feature a  certain Republican governor who has become a potent symbol for both parties, and  well beyond the confines of the Badger State.",

STEVE INSKEEP, HOST: It's MORNING EDITION from NPR News. Good morning, I'm Steve Inskeep. DAVID GREENE, HOST: And I'm David Greene. When it comes to politics in this election cycle, Illinois is a place for grand themes. INSKEEP: It's the home state of Abraham Lincoln, where several Republican candidates now seek to be the leader of the party of Lincoln. GREENE: Illinois is also the home state of President Obama, the man Republicans desperately want to replace. INSKEEP: But before any of them get a chance at that they have to survive the long-running, hand-to-hand combat for the Republican nomination, which gets down to the practical question of piling up convention delegates. GREENE: Many are at stake in today's Illinois primary where Mitt Romney has spent big money to open up a big lead. And we'll begin our coverage from out on the campaign trail with NPR's Ari Shapiro. ARI SHAPIRO, HOST: Mitt Romney's election eve rally at Bradley University seemed like a recipe for a cakewalk. The backdrop was a perfect sunset over a castle-shaped building on a balmy evening. Huge flowering trees behind Romney perfumed the whole event. And this is Peoria - a solidly red part of Illinois. Congressman Aaron Schock, who introduced Romney, even graduated from this school. (SOUNDBITE OF CHEERING) REPRESENTATIVE AARON SCHOCK: And this is our opportunity as Americans to hire one of the best turnaround artists we've ever seen. SHAPIRO: Romney's opening remarks were all about economic freedom and opportunity. He defended small government, low taxes and minimal regulation. MITT ROMNEY: These freedoms make us who we are and make us economically successful and prosperous. SHAPIRO: He even tweaked Rick Santorum for a comment he made earlier in the day. ROMNEY: One of the people who's running also for the Republican nomination today said that he doesn't care about the unemployment rate. That doesn't bother him. I do care about the unemployment rate. It does bother me. SHAPIRO: The thing is, when you turn the floor over to questions from the audience, you never know what you'll get. UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN #1: So you're all for like, yay freedom, and all this stuff. ROMNEY: Absolutely. UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN #1: And, yay, like pursuit of happiness. You know what'd make me happy? Free birth control. (SOUNDBITE OF CHEERING AND BOOING) SHAPIRO: The reaction from the audience was a mix of cheers and boos. Romney returned to a line he often uses. ROMNEY: If you're looking for free stuff you don't have to pay for, vote for the other guy, that's what he's all about. OK? That's not what I'm about. (SOUNDBITE OF BOOING AND CHEERING) SHAPIRO: A recent study by the Brookings Institution showed that when government covers the cost of birth control, it actually saves taxpayers money by reducing unwanted pregnancies, particularly among the poor. That study and others like it suggest that eliminating birth control coverage would not reduce the size and cost of government at all. The second question came from a woman who began by saying: I'm really not talking about birth control when I ask you this question. UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN #2: You've made it very clear that you're not in support of Planned Parenthood. But I'm just wondering where you would suggest that the millions of women who receive their health services, such as mammograms and HPV vaccines, go. SHAPIRO: Well, they can go wherever they'd like to go, this is a free society. But here's what I say, which is the federal government should not tax these people to pay for Planned Parenthood. These social issues were not the economic themes that Romney had planned to focus on. He returned to his preferred message when a student asked about the cost of education. ROMNEY: The best thing I can do for student debt is get you a good job when you come out. SHAPIRO: And he had a similar answer for a realtor, asking how to turn around the housing market. ROMNEY: The best thing I can do for home values is to get the 8.3 percent of people in this country that are out of work back to work. SHAPIRO: It was a large crowd but, as the questions demonstrated, not a wholly friendly one. Christine Slaine is a Bradley University graduate. She's an independent who plans to vote in the Republican primary and she hasn't decided whom to vote for. But Romney did not make a great impression. CHRISTINE SLAINE: I'm unimpressed by his stance on Planned Parenthood. I do feel that that is something that's necessary for this country and for women. So that may sway my vote. SHAPIRO: The event had the opposite effect on 19-year-old Natalie Tumms. She describes herself as a left-leaning independent. NATALIE TUMMS: It kind of made me second guess a couple things. SHAPIRO: Interesting. In what way? TUMMS: Well, I would say I'm strongly supporting of social programs and spending for social programs. But to hear candidate Romney talk about how he thinks that there should be more freedom in the economy, it made me start to think about things differently. SHAPIRO: Tonight, Romney will watch election returns just outside of Chicago. Then it's a flight to Maryland for the next phase in this long-running election drama. Ari Shapiro, NPR News, Chicago.

            "article_content": "It's not that the rhetoric coming out of the Republican presidential campaign is suddenly going to make women around the country start voting Democratic.  Women, for the most part, do prefer Democratic candidates, and have in presidential races at least since 1992.  Four years ago, women preferred Barack Obama over John McCain by some 13 percentage points (the gap was 41 points among single women). But as the conversation has gone from abortion to contraception \u2014 which is, um, virgin territory in presidential campaigns \u2014 anecdotal evidence seems to suggest that it is pushing female voters even further away from the GOP.  Starting off with the seemingly political decision by the Susan G. Komen Foundation (since reversed) to cut off funding for Planned Parenthood, through the attacks on birth control and culminating with Rush Limbaugh's personal attack on Sandra Fluke (\"slut!\" \"prostitute!\"), the party that once cherished individual liberties and freedom is being portrayed as rigid and insensitive. Some in the GOP fear a sharp decrease in the number of women voting for Republican candidates this year. \n                \n                    \n                    Ken Rudin collection\n                    \n                \nhide caption Some in the GOP fear a sharp decrease in the number of women voting for Republican candidates this year. And in the process it may have damaged the national ticket aspirations of Bob McDonnell, the governor of Virginia thought to be a rising star in the GOP.  Republicans in the Virginia General Assembly were pushing legislation that would have required a woman to have an ultrasound probe inserted into her vagina prior to undergoing an abortion, a procedure pushed by anti-abortion legislators in an effort to make a woman think twice before terminating her pregnancy.  The bill was met with widespread ridicule, and it forced McDonnell to pull it and demand changes.  And that in turn led to widespread denunciation of the governor by religious conservatives, who accused McDonnell of selling out. As for Limbaugh, many Republicans insist that he is an entertainer, not a party spokesman, and thus they should not be tarred when he goes off on someone in his broadcasts.  But that's a cop-out, writes Steve Kornacki in Salon: Limbaugh's show is almost entirely about politics, and the themes he stresses invariably echo and influence the themes that Republican politicians across the country emphasize. And Republicans themselves have spent the past two decades promoting the image of Limbaugh as their leader. ... This is what makes the context of Limbaugh's attack on Fluke so damaging for Republicans. It's not just that he said something awful about a 30-year-old woman who hadn't said anything about him. It's that he did so by way of amplifying the GOP's message on contraception. Republicans had been taking pains to claim their objections to the Obama administration's mandate that women be able to obtain birth coverage through their health insurance plans were all about protecting religious liberty \u2014 that they weren't on some puritanical crusade. With his unparalleled platform, Limbaugh has made a mockery of that idea, and he's put a particularly nasty face on the GOP's posturing. As GOP consultant Alex Castellanos told the Daily Beast, \"we have just handed [Democrats] the cudgel one more time, playing into the stereotype that Republicans are anti-women.\" Conservatives dismiss the hubbub over Limbaugh as manufactured outrage by the left in order to make political hay.  The right-wing Hot Air blog had this analysis of the left: They are genuinely offended \u2014 not by the rhetoric, though, but by conservative opposition to abortion and support for prioritizing religious conscience above contraception coverage. That's what makes Rush \"anti-woman\"; the \"slut\" name-calling is, supposedly, a window onto that deeper animus. Because Maher and Olbermann and Taibbi are, ahem, \"pro-woman\" on policy, they can be as personally nasty as they want and it's not a window onto anything. The quintessential example of this is of course Ted Kennedy, whose career stands for the proposition that you can allegedly assault women and even leave a woman to die and be reelected for eternity so long as you vote the right way. Back to polling.  Liz Halloran, my NPR colleague, wrote that the irony in all this is that Republicans were making genuine inroads with women, that female voters preferred GOP candidates in 2010, \"the Republicans' best overall national result among women in 18 years.\"  But now the GOP, \"who so recently saw an opportunity to close the gender gap, may now be watching it widen.\" Lincoln Logs. Another \"all eyes are on\" primary Tuesday; this week it's Illinois and the continuing saga of Mitt Romney vs. Rick Santorum and those two other guys.  But there are also some key House primaries that day as well; Illinois is one of the few states where Democrats had complete control in redrawing the district lines.  Ones to watch: 2nd CD: Rep. Jesse Jackson Jr. (D) was long heralded as a rising star in Chicago politics, with City Hall in the post-Daley era as a likely next stop.  But it wasn't until Barack Obama was elected president that people realized his goal was the Senate.  Now that the ethics committee has been trying to find out if Jackson violated any House rules in his zeal to get then-Gov. Rod Blagojevich to appoint him to Obama's seat, his star has been tarnished.  It even brought him a legitimate Democratic Party challenger in Debbie Halvorson, who served one term in the House before getting clobbered by now-Rep. Adam Kinzinger (R) in 2010.  Halvorson has not been shy about talking about Jackson's ethical questions, and her campaign has similarly not been reticent in talking about his extra-marital affair that dominated headlines awhile back.  But in the view of the party poobahs, Jackson is still too valuable to lose.  And thus Democrats like Obama and Gov. Pat Quinn and Mayor Rahm Emanuel have all joined forces behind J3.  Halvorson, who is white in a majority-black district, is trailing in both polling and money. 3rd CD: Freshman Rep. Joe Walsh (R), who ousted Melissa Bean (D) in a major upset in what was the 8th District, now finds himself in this majority Dem district, courtesy the Democrats who obliterated his original CD.  His opponent in November will either be Tammy Duckworth, who lost her legs in Iraq as the result of a rocket-propelled grenade that hit her helicopter and who as the Democratic nominee in the 6th CD six years ago lost to Peter Roskam (R), or Raja Krishnamoorthi, the Democratic nominee for state Comptroller in 2010. 10th CD: This seat has been a historic GOP seat for ages; think John Edward Porter and Mark Steven Kirk (now senator). Bob Dold doesn't have three names but he is nonetheless the latest Republican to hold the seat, which has been made more Democratic through redistricting.  Top Dems in Tuesday's primary are thought to be Brad Schneider and Ilya Sheyman, a former activist with MoveOn. 11th CD:  Bill Foster, the Democrat who lost his House seat to Randy Hultgren (R) in a nearby district in 2010, is seeking a comeback here, where he hopes to take on Rep. Judy Biggert (R) in November. 12th CD: Rep. Jerry Costello (D), first elected in 1988 following the death of longtime Democratic incumbent Melvin Price, is retiring.  Top candidates: ex-local schools superintendent Brad Harriman (D) and 2010 GOP lt. gov. nominee Jason Plummer. Two House incumbents have gone down to defeat in the primaries thus far.  Another one is guaranteed to lose in Illinois on Tuesday.\n                \n                    \n                    Ken Rudin collection\n                    \n                \nhide caption 16th CD: Another example of Democratic line drawing is here in the Republican primary between two incumbents.  Freshman Rep. Adam Kinzinger, who knocked off Debbie Halvorson (D) in 2010, found himself without a district and decided to challenge Rep. Don Manzullo, who was first elected in 1992 and is the senior Republican in the delegation.  Similar in some ways to the Romney vs. Santorum battle, both Republicans are arguing that the other's conservative bona fides are suspect.  Kinzinger has corraled some impressive endorsements, such as from House Majority Leader Eric Cantor, which has led Manzullo's supporters to call Kinzinger a creature of the establishment.  The battle is bitter and expensive, and while the primary winner is assured of victory in November, it will result in the removal of one GOP incumbent. 17th CD: Still another district where a Republican freshman has been redrawn for the purpose of electing a Democrat.  Rep. Bobby Schilling (R), who upset Phil Hare (D) in 2010, may be an underdog in the fall to former East Moline Councilmember Cheri Bustos (D). The 2012 story so far: Mitt Romney (20 contests won): New Hampshire (1/10), Florida (1/31), Nevada (2/4),  Maine (2/4-11), Arizona (2/28), Michigan (2/28), Washington (3/3), Alaska (3/6), Idaho (3/6), Massachusetts (3/6), Ohio (3/6), Vermont (3/6), Virginia (3/6), Wyoming (3/6-10), Guam (3/10), Northern Mariana Islands (3/10), Virgin Islands (3/10), American Samoa (3/13), Hawaii (3/13), Puerto Rico (3/18)     =   521 delegates. Rick Santorum (9):  Iowa (1/3), Minnesota (2/7), Colorado (2/7), North Dakota (3/6), Oklahoma (3/6), Tennessee (3/6), Kansas (3/10), Alabama (3/13), Mississippi (3/13)  =  253 delegates. Newt Gingrich (2): South Carolina (1/31), Georgia (3/6) =  136 delegates. Ron Paul (0) =  50 delegates. Delegate total as of March 18 according to Associated Press.  A total of 1,144 delegates are needed to win the nomination. Senate race ratings update. Since my Jan. 17 attempt at rating this year's Senate races, two changes need to be made. Maine \u2014 The decision by three-term Sen. Olympia Snowe (R) to call it quits stunned everyone in the state.  But while the announcement was first greeted by many as a likely Dem pickup, the candidacy of former Gov. Angus King (I) scared off all leading Democratic hopefuls.  The seat goes from Republican Favored to Expected GOP Loss/Independent Pickup. New Jersey \u2014 At the very least, the candidacy of GOP state Sen. Joe Kyrillos makes it clear that Gov. Chris Christie (R) is going to attempt to make life difficult for Democratic incumbent Bob Menendez.  It still is a long way to go for Kyrillos, a strong ally of the governor, to win the seat.  But I'm moving it from Safe Democratic to Democrat Favored. Are some Super PACs more super than others? I always get in trouble when I voice my opinion on something, and the subject of money in politics does manage to arouse a lot of emotion.  But I'm wondering what you thought of this comment from the New York Times' Matt Bai, who penned it in the March 11 edition of the Sunday magazine.  It kind of mirrors my thoughts too, and I know, by expressing that, I'm asking for trouble.  But here it is.  Let me know what you think: MATT BAI:  I get why Democrats are appalled by the millions of dollars being poured into Republican campaigns by a handful of super PAC donors. But back in 2004, they didn't seem at all troubled when a couple of billionaires \u2014 George Soros and Peter Lewis \u2014 threw more than $50 million into their own independent groups to try to unseat George W. Bush. The laws keep changing, but one rule of human nature stays the same: Money is corrupting only when it's helping a cause you don't believe in. Oklahoma is not OK with him.  This hit me as odd, and I don't think I realized it until well after the fact.  But, in basically running unopposed for renomination, President Obama received just 57 percent of the vote in the Oklahoma Democratic primary on March 6.  Some 18 percent went to Randall Terry, the anti-abortion activist and founder of Operation Rescue who, under party rules, will now be entitled to at least one delegate.  According to an A.P. account of the results, Terry beat Obama in 12 counties in Oklahoma, mostly in the west, and Jim Rogers of Midwest City beat Obama in three counties. This, of course, will not endanger the odds of Obama being selected by the delegates in Charlotte this summer.  And no one ever thought that the president was doing well in the Sooner State, let alone in position to carry it in November.  But 57 percent among his fellow Democrats?  The last Democratic incumbent to basically have a free run to renomination was Bill Clinton in 1996.  According to Congressional Quarterly's Guide to U.S. Elections, his worst showing was (gulp) in his home state of Arkansas.  But he still managed 75.8 percent of the vote (with 13.4 percent going to Uncommitted and 6.6 percent to Lyndon LaRouche). If they can't make it there.  New York's long awaited congressional redistricting map is out, and it's not good for some incumbents of both parties.  That in itself is not much of a surprise; with the state slated to lose two seats because of population changes, and with Democrats and Republicans both having a say on who is protected and who ain't, we knew there would be some unhappy faces in the delegation. But the biggest changes affected freshman Bob Turner (R) and veteran Gary Ackerman (D).  Turner has been in office only since September, when he won the seat (centered in Queens) vacated by Anthony Weiner.  Turner was the first Republican to win that district since the 1920s.  With his district obliterated, he announced he will instead challenge Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand (D) for her seat.  Turner leaving the House was not a surprise but Ackerman's decision to retire was; he was telling allies very recently that he planned to seek another term for the seat he's held since winning a special election in 1983. (For the record, he says his retirement is not in response to the new lines.)  His district, stretching from northeast Queens into Nassau County, is thought to be reliably Democratic. Political Updates. I post periodic political updates during the week on Twitter. You can follow me at @kenrudin.  No room for readers' questions this week, but here are two comments: I enjoy the Political Junkie segment on Talk of the Nation but during the introductory medley of famous and infamous political quotes, female politicians are represented by only one woman and one word \u2014 and that word is \"lipstick.\"  I realize the political world is not gender balanced, particularly if you're choosing from presidential and vice presidential candidates.  However, Geraldine Ferraro, Hillary Clinton and Michele Bachmann must have an interesting quote or two among them.  I hope you'll consider adding at least one more female voice. \u2014 Louise Piantedosi, Medway, Mass. And then there was this one, which I'm betting/hoping was written tongue in cheek: For almost five years now I have listened to TOTN on Wednesdays, and the It's All Politics podcast. I have suffered countless bad puns.  I have endured Mara Liasson's pinch-hitting when you have even the faintest of sniffles. And NPR's relentless left wing bias. I don't know why I've subjected myself to this abuse. I suppose what has driven me to such extremes is the allure of a No Prize Tee-Shirt. I'm like Gollum and this Tee is the ring. My precious. I listen every Wednesday to your evil questions. I prep myself studying the news of the week, looking for anything that might be the prompt for your devious puzzler. I have Google ready when you announce it, and I never EVER figure out the answer. Years of failure have trailed is left in the wake of my Wednesday TOTN addiction. I suspect this is because I'm predominantly handicapped by a strong libertarian strain in my thinking. I did vote for Ron Paul in '08, after all. But alas, after years of communist NPR propaganda, mainly from the mouth of Ken Rudin, I've been pushed into becoming a right of center Obama democrat. This enlightened shift I assume helped me solve the ScuttleButton puzzle last week. And then you got lazy. Your carrot became a dreadful Wednesday stick, whereby you and Neil Conan nearly bored me to death without so much as a new ScuttleButton question, nor an announced winner. Which should have been me. AND you short-changed Ron Paul in your coverage just because he came in fourth in a 4-way race between 4 idiots. Shame, Ken. Shame. There is clearly a conspiracy at NPR, specifically in the Political Junkie's office, and if next Wednesday you don't announce me as the ScuttleButton winner I will report you to James O'Keefe. Hell, I'll hold the boom mike for him when he storms your offices. \u2014 Milo Mowery, ScuttleButton winner in all but name only, Tacoma, Wash.  Political Junkie segment on Talk of the Nation.

Nina Turner, a Democrat, has introduced legislation that would regulated men's use of reproductive health services. For perhaps the first time in recent history, male reproductive health is at the forefront of political debate. In at least six states, lawmakers \u2014 all women and all Democrats \u2014 have proposed bills or amendments in the last few weeks that aim to regulate a man's access to reproductive health care.  It's their way of responding to the ongoing debate around contraception and abortion, said Jennifer Lawless, director of the Women & Politics Institute at American University. Some would prohibit men from getting vasectomies, such as Georgia's House Bill 1116, which states: \"Thousands of children are deprived of birth in this state every year because of the lack of state regulation over vasectomies.\" Others, like an amendment proposed by Oklahoma State Sen. Constance Johnson, restrict where a man can ejaculate, effectively outlawing all manner of sexual acts. The amendment says: \"Any action in which a man ejaculates or otherwise deposits semen anywhere but in a woman's vagina shall be interpreted and construed as an action against an unborn child.\" And Ohio State Sen. Nina Turner recently put forward legislation that would require men seeking drugs like Viagra to first get a cardiac stress test to ensure their heart is ready for sexual activity. Oh, and they would also have to obtain certification from one of their recent sexual partners that they are indeed experiencing problems with erectile dysfunction. And they would be required to see a sex therapist before getting a prescription. The bill states: \"The physician shall ensure that the sessions include information on nonpharmaceutical treatments for erectile dysfunction, including sexual counseling and resources for patients to pursue celibacy as a viable lifestyle choice.\" Turner says society has been programmed to accept the idea that legislators can regulate a woman's ability to obtain contraception or get a safe abortion. \"We don't see anything wrong with it because that's the way we've been socialized,\" she told Shots. But now that the tables are turning and the focus is on men's reproductive health, people think it's strange, she said. However, American University's Lawless said that bills like Turner's have almost a zero likelihood of becoming law. Already, we are seeing some of them shot down.  In January, the Virginia Senate voted against an amendment proposed by Virginia Sen. Janet Howell, a Democrat,  which would have required a man to get a digital rectal exam and cardiac stress test before getting a prescription for an erectile-dysfunction drug. Howell proposed her amendment in response to a controversial bill that would require women seeking abortions to undergo ultrasound imaging first. The bill eventually passed and was signed into law after vaginal ultrasounds were dropped from the requirements. The ultimate goal in proposing bills related to male reproductive health is not to get them passed, Lawless said. By drawing attention to these bills, she said,  Democrats are looking to motivate independent and undecided voters, especially women, to show up at the polls in November for the general election.",

They fared better than Democrats among women overall in the 2010 midterm election \u2014 the Republicans' best overall national result among women in 18 years. And 2012  seemed to have the potential to turn that good showing into a trend, a key advantage in an  electorate where women make up the majority of all voters. Romney supporters celebrate in Boston on Super Tuesday. Exit polls from Super Tuesday's GOP presidential contests suggest that front-runner Mitt Romney does best with women voters.\n                \n                    \n                    Justin Sullivan/Getty Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption Romney supporters celebrate in Boston on Super Tuesday. Exit polls from Super Tuesday's GOP presidential contests suggest that front-runner Mitt Romney does best with women voters. Polls taken as recently as the end of last year suggested that women's support for President Obama was weakening. In 2008, Obama corralled 56 percent of women's votes \u2014 13 percentage points more than his GOP opponent John McCain. And, since women cast nearly 8 million more votes than men that year, Obama rode the gender gap all the way to the White House. Republican  front-runner Mitt Romney appeared poised to challenge Obama for the  women's vote. Exit polls from Super Tuesday's GOP presidential contests suggest  that Romney does better among women voters than among men. Earlier this year,  he also polled better than Obama among women in hypothetical head-to-head  national matchups. But the  events of recent days are  raising questions about whether Republicans, who so recently saw an opportunity to close the  gender gap, may now be watching it  widen given the recent maelstrom surrounding women, contraception,  Congress, Catholics and conservative radio host Rush Limbaugh. And surveys taken even before the commotion suggested that women were  already starting to come back to Obama, giving him more credit than men were for  economic gains. The Limbaugh Effect Many  Republicans are still shaking their heads at how quickly the debate turned on an  issue where they had traction with a wide swath of the  electorate. Limbaugh's  on-air characterization of a young female advocate of employer coverage of  contraception as a \"slut\" and \"prostitute\" galvanized Democrats who had been  attempting to establish a narrative that Republicans were attempting to meddle  with women's rights and health choices. Before  Limbaugh's crude injection of himself into the discussion, the public was  divided over a proposed federal rule that would require employers, including  most religious organizations, to cover contraception as part of their health  care benefit plans, according to a February Pew Research Center poll. Independent  voters surveyed were the most evenly split, with 48 percent saying that  religious institutions should be required to provide contraception coverage, and  46 percent saying they should be \"given an  exemption.\" The survey,  says Pew's Carroll Doherty, was taken during the time the Obama administration  modified its proposal to include most, but not all, institutions affiliated with  religious organizations in the coverage mandate. But once  Limbaugh weighed in, the debate center shifted from the question of religion and  contraception coverage to women's private lives and their ability to speak in a  public forum without being denigrated. Obama  telephoned the young activist, Georgetown law student Sandra Fluke, to encourage her to stay involved and  suggest that her parents would be proud of her. On Tuesday he  told reporters that he was motivated, in part, by thoughts of his own two  daughters and how he would want them to be treated when they grow up and engage  in issues publicly. \"I don't  want them attacked or called horrible names because they're being good  citizens,\" Obama said. The head of  Carbonite, one of the many businesses that have pulled advertising from  Limbaugh's show, said on Facebook that he, too, thought of his daughters when he  made his decision. Ground To Make Up 1 of 14 full results The GOP  candidates' tepid responses to Limbaugh's comments did not help the party's effort to woo women. They ranged  from Santorum suggesting that as \"an entertainer,\" Limbaugh \"can be absurd,\" to  Romney's \"it's not the language I would have used.\" The superPAC supporting Newt  Gingrich is running ads on Limbaugh's show. \"Republicans are not hostile toward contraception,\" says  conservative pollster Kristen Soltis. \"The real issue is what employers should  be required to do, and what should government pay  for.\" \"There are  real arguments about the role and size of government, and the employer/employee  relationship that can be very favorable to Republicans,\" Soltis says.  \"Unfortunately, the conversation has gone to birth control and value judgments  about people who use birth control.\" Conservatives have also argued that liberal and  progressive commentators, including  MSNBC's Ed Schultz and Chris Matthews, have made disparaging  comments about women that prompted none of the outrage heaped on  Limbaugh. Liberals  have, indeed, been more effective in making Limbaugh a symbol in a conversation  that was already beginning to favor Obama. Polls Show Obama Gains An  Associated Press-GfK poll conducted in February showed Obama's approval rating  improving, and gaining with women who give him more credit than men for the  strengthening economy. His support between December and February climbed 10  percentage points among women. A  Washington Post/Pew poll released this week showed that Obama was even gaining  among white women, a group he lost in 2008. In January, white women preferred  Romney 50-44 percent, according to Doherty of the Pew Research Center. By February, Obama had taken the  lead, with 52 percent of white women saying they preferred the president to  Romney, who had fallen to 46 percent. Pew experts  were also struck, Doherty said, that Obama's lead against Romney among all women \"was  quite substantial, 59-38 percent.\" Men polled preferred Romney, 50-45  percent. The gap  between men and women, however, has not been out of line with previous  elections, though the survey was taken in the early stage of the contraception  controversy, Doherty said. At the end  of the day, however, Democrats like consultant Kiki McLean say that it will be  economic issues that drive the choices of women  voters. Access to  contraception and health care are part of that economic equation for women, says  McLean, a veteran Democratic campaign adviser, but \"they don't stand  alone.\" \"Women  voters are very sophisticated, and they won't be taken for granted,\" she said.  \"The concept that women vote on a single issue is a falsehood \u2014 they care about  the economy as much anyone else, from how it affects health care, job creating  and taking care of their children, to building a business, and providing  economic and educational opportunities.\" On that,  she and Soltis, the Republican pollster, agree. \"Economic  issues will be what decide the election at the end of the day,\" Soltis  says.

It's not going to be driven by one  statement by one radio announcer.\" \"I'm not  somebody who believes that women are going to be single-issue voters; they never  have been,\" he said. \"But I do think that we've got a strong story to tell when  it comes to women.\" While the  events of the past several days haven't been helpful to Republicans, Soltis says  she doesn't see them as decisive. \"There is  plenty of time and plenty of opportunity,\" Soltis says. \"If this GOP primary has  shown anything, it's that a week is an eternity.\" And it's  certainly given women voters plenty to contemplate.",

            "article_content": "Mitt Romney won six of the 10 Super Tuesday contests. Rick Santorum won three while Newt Gingrich won one. Ron Paul was the only candidate who did not win at least one contest.  RENEE MONTAGNE, HOST: It's MORNING EDITION, from NPR News. Good morning. I'm Renee Montagne. STEVE INSKEEP, HOST: And I'm Steve Inskeep. Here's another morning where perceptions mean a lot to Mitt Romney. He won six of 10 states that voted on Super Tuesday. Nobody else came close. That means a lot of convention delegates for Romney, after wins in Virginia, Massachusetts, Vermont, Idaho, Alaska and the key state of Ohio. But Romney's win in Ohio over Rick Santorum was narrow, and given all of his advantages of money and organization, Romney did not wipe out his rivals, as NPR's Mara Liasson reports. MARA LIASSON, BYLINE: Even before the final results from Ohio were in, Mitt Romney was at his victory party in Massachusetts promising his supporters he would be the nominee, but also acknowledging the race had been a harder slog than he expected. (SOUNDBITE OF SPEECH) MITT ROMNEY: It's been a long road getting to Super Tuesday. Let me be honest. And my opponents have worked very hard. I want to congratulate Newt Gingrich on a good night in Georgia and Rick Santorum on his good night, and Ron Paul... LIASSON: And that was the only mention he made of his Republican rivals. The  rest of  Romney's speech showed how eager he was to free himself from the circular firing squad of the Republican primary and get on with the big battle against President Obama, a fight he's had to neglect while spending time and money fending off a tag team of flawed and underfunded challengers. Last night, he turned his attention back to the man he plans to run against this fall. (SOUNDBITE OF SPEECH) ROMNEY: To the millions of Americans who look around and can only see jobs they can't get and bills that they can't pay, I have a message: You have not failed. You have a president that's failed you, and that's going to change. (SOUNDBITE OF CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) LIASSON: Romney has based his campaign on his ability to turn the economy around, so he needs to convince Americans that despite some recent improvements, the economy is not getting better fast enough. ROMNEY: My friends, the truth is, 8 percent unemployment is not the best America can do. It's just the best that this administration can do. (SOUNDBITE OF CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) LIASSON: For Rick Santorum, Ohio may have been the last chance to slow Romney's march to the nomination. Santorum held his election night party in Steubenville, Ohio, in a high school gym without any of the fancy trappings of a victory night celebration. He told his working-class supporters that his campaign was about all the towns that had been left behind. (SOUNDBITE OF CHEERING AND APPLAUSE) (SOUNDBITE OF SPEECH) RICK SANTORUM: We need a fighter. We need a fighter and someone who learned what America was about by growing up in communities just like this, understanding how America and neighborhoods and families work, and believing in them, understanding they're under a lot of stress and strain right now, much of which is put upon them by the government. LIASSON: Santorum has relied heavily on social issues to win over conservatives, but he didn't talk about abortion or contraception or gay marriage last night. Instead, he painted a dark picture of an overreaching government that would use the new health care law to break the back of liberty, a health care law he accused Mitt Romney of supporting. (SOUNDBITE OF SPEECH) SANTORUM: Ladies and gentlemen, this is the beginning of the end of freedom in America. Once the government has control of your life, then they got you. LIASSON: Newt Gingrich easily won his home state of Georgia - a state he said he needed in order to continue in the race. With his first win since South Carolina, Gingrich announced he was moving on to the upcoming contests in Mississippi, Alabama and Kansas. (SOUNDBITE OF SPEECH) NEWT GINGRICH: There are lots of bunny rabbits that run through. I'm the tortoise. I just take one step at a time. (SOUNDBITE OF CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) LIASSON: Ron Paul hasn't won a single state yet, and even though he came up empty-handed again last night, he told his supporters they had sent a strong message to the rest of the country that all the other candidates were the same. Only he was different. (SOUNDBITE OF SPEECH) RON PAUL: The rest of the candidates support the status quo. Foreign policies never change. Monetary policy doesn't change. There's no challenge to the Federal Reserve system, and... LIASSON: Exit polls showed that, once again, Santorum did best with evangelical voters, like Mary Lou Reynolds from Ohio. MARY LOU REYNOLDS: He seems very down to earth. I like his spiritual living, and so forth. And he's a father. He's a family man. LIASSON: Romney continued to do best with more affluent educated voters and those who considered the economy the most important issue. Betty Miller, a retired registered nurse from Oklahoma, voted for Romney. BETTY MILLER: And I voted for him because I want, first of all, to get this economy and jobs back to work. LIASSON: Don and Mary Romine, also from Oklahoma, were Newt Gingrich fans. But when it came time to choose, they split their votes. DON ROMINE: Yeah, I voted for Newt Gingrich. MARY ROMINE: I voted for Mitt Romney because I'm tired of the Republicans fighting among each other. And I really am for Newt, but I don't think he has the chance. When it comes down to it, I think Mitt is going to be the candidate. LIASSON: Romney's narrow win in Ohio could convince more Republicans to do the same: fall in line even if they're not falling in love - because after Super Tuesday, it becomes harder for any of the other candidates to map out a path to the 1,144 delegates needed to win the nomination. Now it's easier for Romney to make the case that although the race is far from over, he is the inevitable nominee. Mara Liasson, NPR News, Washington. Copyright \u00a9 2012 NPR.

            "article_content": "We are in a politically polarized age of alternative realities: biases often count more than facts. So when NPR does a story about a politically sensitive topic, even the smallest error or omission is taken by one group or another as proof of NPR's own bias. This is the case of two recent stories about Catholics, contraceptives and government policy. Social conservatives in the blogosphere were right in catching NPR mistakes in the citing of a public opinion poll by Planned Parenthood and of a study by the Guttmacher Institute, both on contraception and Catholics. I don't find \"liberal bias,\" as some critics charged. But I did find unacceptably loose citing of polls, aggravated by repeating an error in a Guttmacher press release.  Both organizations are known for their service and research, but because they also advocate, reporters need to be as rigorous in reporting about their studies as with any other. The stories dealt with the confrontation between the Obama administration and Catholic bishops over a planned mandate requiring church-affiliated universities and hospitals to offer free birth control as part of their health care plans. The requirement extends to most employers' health plans.  The administration has since compromised on the church institutions, but the debate pitting religious freedom against women's access to birth control rages on. In a close vote last week, the Senate rejected a measure to exempt any employer who claimed moral opposition to the insurance requirement. On All Things Considered Feb. 7, reporter Scott Horsley cited a poll released that day that said 53 percent of Catholic voters supported the free contraception mandate.  Horsley reported that the survey was conducted by Public Policy Polling. What he didn't add on air was that it was sponsored by Planned Parenthood, which backs the mandate. Having paid for many polls myself on behalf of The Wall Street Journal, I know that the questions are worked out between the client and the professional polling firm, giving the sponsor final say over exactly what is being measured.  Influence over the question obviously gives you influence over the answer.  I am not suggesting that Planned Parenthood loaded the dice in this poll, but its role should have been made clear. It goes down to the very center of theology, Catholic theology. Horsley readily admits that he was in error.  \"I don't want to call it inadvertent or an oversight, which suggests I didn't notice Planned Parenthood's involvement at the time,\" he wrote to me in an email. \"But on further reflection, I agree that's salient information.\" Bias can be exhibited by a journalist failing to question information from sources she or he favors.   But Horsley, a highly respected professional, told me that three factors were what influenced him. One, Public Policy Polling is reputable. Two, the question seemed \"neutral\" to him.  (See below.)  And three, a second poll released at the same time seemed to have similar results.  This poll, by the Public Religion Research Institute, a non-profit polling institute that does not do advocacy, found that 52 percent of Catholics agreed that religiously affiliated colleges and hospitals should be subject to the mandate. \"I would take issue with anyone who tries to argue that Planned Parenthood's sponsorship somehow negates the findings of a reputable polling organization, especially when those findings are consistent with other polls,\" Horsley said.  \"I simply acknowledge that it would be better to let the listener, armed with all relevant information, make that decision for himself/herself.\" Truth in advertising: I myself am Catholic.  I also have no reason to believe that Horsley committed anything more than an honest mistake.  NPR.org's online versions of the story, meanwhile, correctly named Planned Parenthood's role. There clearly was no pre-ordained agenda to hide Planned Parenthood's role. But hardly helping to make that case was an overlooked weakness in the poll itself. Regardless of bias, did the errors have any consequences? The sample was too small to hang much on.  According to Public Policy Polling, its poll results for Planned Parenthood were based on a sample of 359 Catholic voters and had a margin of error of  +/ - 5.2 percent, which is large. The respondents favored the insurance mandate on Catholic hospitals and universities by a margin of 53 percent to 45 percent.  This may look like a wide gap. But remember, a +/- 5 percent margin of error means that the results could potentially be reversed: 48 percent in favor of the mandate, 50 percent against it. Horsley, to his credit, used fudge language by saying that the poll \"suggests\" most Catholic voters agree.  But he then interviewed the poll director, Tom Jensen, who said on air of both Catholics and women:  \"These are obviously groups that are going to be really key for the election this fall \u2014 swing voter groups. And they're all quite supportive of the birth control benefit.\" It's not clear that Catholic voters, in fact, are. Let's look again at the second poll commissioned by the Public Religion Research Institute.  While a slight majority of Catholic respondents in general favored the insurance mandate for religiously affiliated colleges and hospitals, 52 percent of the ones identified as Catholic voters actually opposed the mandate.  This is the opposite of the Planned Parenthood result, which also measured voters.  The margin of error in this second poll is +/- 7.5 percent. I took these differences to one of the leading authorities on health policy polling, Robert Blendon, a professor and head of the Opinion Research Program at the Harvard School of Public Health.  We were once colleagues together at Harvard. He responded:  \"When results are close to the margin of error they should be reported as 'people being divided.'  We also suggest that you should always report the margin of error or confidence level for the entire survey, and if you are focusing your discussion on a particular subgroup, you should report the margin of errors for that subgroup.\" The possibility of opposition to the mandate fell within the margin of error. Blendon and his team said they prefer the design of a poll on the same subject released one week later, on Feb. 14, by Pew Research Center. It found that among the respondents who have heard of the issue, 55 percent of Catholics\u2014in general, not just voters\u2014say that the religious institutions should be exempted from the insurance mandate to give free birth control.   This is contrary to the finding of the Public Religion Research Institute about all Catholics.  And if Catholic voters are even more opposed to the mandate than Catholics overall, as the religion institute poll indicates, then the difference with the Planned Parenthood poll is a gaping sinkhole. A direct comparison of the three polls is unfair, because they were done at different times with different methodologies.  Still, the difference underlines the importance of margin of error.  Pew, for example, was still careful to conclude that Catholic opinion was \"divided,\" correctly taking into account its large margin of error of 6.5 percent. Then, there is the wording of the question.  This obviously makes a difference.  But designing questions is as much an art form as a science, and many experts can disagree on which wording is most fair.  So, after toiling for days without coming to a clear conclusion on the questions, I am going to punt and let you decide for yourself. I have posted the relevant questions from the three polls. I will join you in the discussion. The second disputed story on the topic of Catholics and birth control aired Feb. 10 on Morning Edition.  Reporter Don Gonyea turned to the related question of actual birth control use by Catholic women.  He said, citing no one:  \"In fact, 98 percent of Catholic women use birth control at some point in their lifetimes.\" The source for that \"fact\" is the Guttmacher Institute.  Many other reporters throughout the news media cited the same number in more or less the same way.  But if you think about it\u2014if you think about virgins, the extremely devout, older women, etc.\u2014the 98 percent figure seems highly unlikely.  And it is.  It comes from an error in the press release of the report's findings. The data inside the report itself shows that the 98 percent figure refers to Catholic women in the childbearing years between the ages 15 and 44 who have had vaginal intercourse at least once in their lives.  It did not include data for Catholic women in general.  The authors of the study have since issued a clarification. Think about it: virgins, elderly, the devout\u2014Guttmacher's 98% seems highly unlikely. The data itself is mined from the National Survey of Family Growth, a large, detailed, face-to-face survey poll done between 2006 and 2008 by the federal government's Center for Disease Control, a gold standard of sources. The margin of error on this particular question was +/- 1 percent, according to Guttmacher researcher Rachel Jones. Ron Elving, the supervising senior editor who oversees the Washington desk, where Gonyea works, recognized the repeat of the press release mistake:  \"It would have been better to say 'an overwhelming majority of Catholic women of child-bearing age have used contraception.'  This would not have the ring of the specific statistic but would not raise the questions of methodology or cast doubt on its accuracy.\" The study, too, should have been cited. And as a poll with a margin of error.  One percent is a small margin, but as Rick Edmonds, a polling expert at the Poynter Institute, a journalism training center in St. Petersburg, FL, told me, \"A survey is not a fact.\" Still, nothing indicates bad intention. Gonyea's context, moreover, was fair.  Immediately before citing the Guttmacher number on air, he played a soundbite from a Catholic doctor at a Republican political rally.  The doctor, eloquently sharing the bishops' position, said: \"It goes down to the very center of theology, Catholic theology, or teaching about the human person.\" But, wait, there is still a separate consideration in all this that has nothing to do with bias. Did the errors have any meaningful consequence? For the first story, for example, did NPR mislead Catholics on public opinion such that it fueled a bandwagon effect supporting the birth control mandate in opposition to the bishops? We will never know for sure.  But the later Pew study suggests that the Catholic tide of opinion moved in favor of the bishops' side anyway, though the margin of error prevents any hard conclusion. As for the story mentioning the Guttmacher study, a second, unreported part of that study is instructive.  This part looked at Catholic women between the ages of 15 and 44 who are sexually active currently.  This means that they say that they have had vaginal intercourse at least once in the last three months.  The study further separated out women who were pregnant, trying to become pregnant, or were in post partum.  The sample was reduced, in other words, to those women who are at risk of an unintended pregnancy\u2014meaning the very women about whom the whole debate swirls. The results showed that between 83 percent and 87 percent of these Catholic women used artificial birth control at the time of the study (2006-2008).  The difference depends mostly on how to classify penis withdrawal by the male partner before ejaculation.  Neither number is 98 percent, but both are so overwhelming that the difference hardly matters. In case you're curious, the breakdown on women, who responded yes-no to different birth control methods, was as follows:  sterilization (32 percent), pills (31 percent), condoms (15 percent), IUD (five percent), and other, mostly withdrawal (4 percent).  A mysterious 11 percent said they used no method but still didn't want to get pregnant. Two percent specifically said they used \"natural family planning.\" This latter is the church's officially prescribed method, and mostly includes rhythm and temperature methods. Influence over the poll question gives you influence over the answer. The complete CDC questions used by Guttmacher also are available for you to tear apart if you wish. What does all the above mean?  To be fair, I have to admit that I have been going round for days trying to fully understand these many polls, and I still fear I have gotten something wrong.  Reporters on deadline don't have that time luxury.  But as we go deeper into an election year, polls will only play a bigger role in politics and the coverage.  Some polls are manipulative by design, and almost all press releases on polls exaggerate by trying to draw headline-making conclusions.  Reporters and editors have to as careful as possible to define just what is being measured, how it compares to other measures, and what the margin of error is. This, too, must also be remembered: Polls are indications of public sentiment, not hard facts or predictions. Proceed with caution. Stephannie Stokes and Andrew Maddocks contributed to this post.

As advertisers continue to bail from \"The Rush Limbaugh Show\" after the host called a law student a \"slut\" and \"prostitute,\" the superPAC supporting GOP presidential candidate Newt Gingrich has essentially doubled down. Gingrich himself has denounced Limbaugh's remarks, but it hasn't cooled the pro-Gingrich group Winning Our Future. \"Actually, we bought more,\" Rick Tyler, a senior adviser for Winning Our Future, tells NPR. Tyler says the superPAC expanded its media buy for pro-Gingrich spots on the show because the conservative talk host \"reaches more listeners who are likely primary voters in all the states than anybody else.\" Tyler declined to say how much was spent on the ads, but says they are a \"big part\" of a national media buy in Super Tuesday states. He says the ads will continue to run in such states as Kansas, Alabama and Mississippi, which hold their primaries next week. Last week on his show, Limbaugh called Georgetown University law school  student Sandra Fluke a \"slut\" and a \"prostitute\" for recently telling House Democrats that birth control should be covered under  employee health insurance plans. Fluke was addressing the  administration's policy requiring that religiously affiliated institutions provide employees access to insurance that covers birth control. Facing withering criticism, Limbaugh this week issued a written apology and attempted on his show Monday to clarify his remarks. Regarding the sincerity of Limbaugh's apology, Tyler says he takes Limbaugh \"at his word.\" Tyler says  he understood the intent of Limbaugh's original argument: \"Why should we pay for people's  contraceptives? It's really an attack on religious freedom.\" Limbaugh's apology hasn't slowed the avalanche of outrage from multiple quarters, or the procession of companies pulling ads from his show. Various reports Tuesday afternoon put the count at more than 30 companies. During his Monday show, Limbaugh said the advertisers have \"chosen to deny themselves that access....They've decided they don't want  you or your business anymore. So be it.\" In addition, two radio stations \u2014 in Hawaii  and Massachusetts  \u2014 have decided to stop broadcasting   the show because of Limbaugh's comments. Other conservatives this week have demanded the same degree of public outcry for attacks on conservative women by liberals. Appearing Monday on CNN's \"Piers Morgan Tonight,\" Rep. Michele Bachmann (D-Minn) said: \"I've been on the receiving end of it, we know Gov. Palin has been on the receiving end of it. ...You don't see this same level of outrage.\" In a White House briefing Tuesday, Obama declined to comment on Limbaugh's apology, saying \"I don't know what's in Rush Limbaugh's heart\" but said his remarks about Fluke \"have no place in the public discourse.\" The president also invoked his daughters in addressing the issue of gender equality: \"I thought about Malia and Sasha...and I don't want them attacked or called horrible names because they are being good citizens.\" The Limbaugh show syndicated by Premiere Radio Networks to some 600 stations in the U.S. Rachel Nelson, a company spokeswoman, emailed a statement to NPR calling the host's remarks \"an attempt at absurdist humor\": \"We respect the right of Mr. Limbaugh, as well as the rights of those who disagree with him, to express those opinions. The contraception debate is one that sparks strong emotion and opinions on both sides of the issue. ...in an attempt at absurdist humor to illustrate his political point, Mr. Limbaugh used words that unfortunately distracted from the message he was trying to convey.  We believe he did the right thing on Saturday, and again on his radio show on Monday, by expressing regret for his choice of words and offering his sincere and heartfelt apology to Ms. Fluke.\"",

With 10 states holding Republican primaries or caucuses on March 6 \u2014 Super Tuesday \u2014 a lot of money is being spent on TV ads. The superPACs supporting the remaining GOP candidates have doled out some $12 million for ads in those states. Leading the way is Restore Our Future, the superPAC that backs former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney. According to Federal Election Commission numbers, Restore Our Future has spent $6.9 million on the Super Tuesday states. \"The groups have clearly taken the lead in advertising for the whole Republican primary. They're very much taking the lead in advertising for Super Tuesday. It's mostly the 'Restore Our Future show,' followed by Winning Our Future, which is the Gingrich group, and Red, White and Blue, which is the Santorum group,\" says Ken Goldstein, who tracks political ad spending for Kantar Media CMAG. Red, White and Blue has spent some $1.3 million on Super Tuesday, and has been running an ad in Ohio that goes after Romney for his alleged similarities to the man all Republicans want to defeat in November: President Obama. The first ad, from the Red, White and Blue fund, which backs Rick Santorum, attacks Mitt Romney and Newt Gingrich. The second ad, from Restore Our Future, which backs Romney, goes after Gingrich. \"How can Mitt Romney beat Barack Obama, when on the vital decisions they're not much different?\" the ad asks. \"Like Obama, Romney drastically increased spending, increased state taxes and fees. Even worse, 'Romneycare' is the blueprint for 'Obamacare.' Who can win? Rick Santorum, the principled leader who's fought against big government.\" Restore our Future, meanwhile, has targeted Santorum in an ad running in Ohio that uses the former Pennsylvania senator's explanation during a debate last month for why he voted to give Planned Parenthood federal funds. \"Santorum says he's the principled conservative, but that's not how he voted,\" says the ad. \"Here are Santorum's own words on voting to fund Planned Parenthood: 'While I have a personal moral objection to it, even though I don't support it, ... I voted for bills that included it.' Twenty years in Washington changed Santorum's principles.\" Newt Gingrich, who hasn't had a victory since South Carolina in January, has focused most of his efforts on winning Georgia, the state he represented in Congress. The superPAC that backs him, Winning Our Future, has spent $1.1 million in the state, a little less than a third of the dollars it has spent overall on Super Tuesday. \"We're looking at 5- or 6-dollar-gas,\" says a woman in an ad by Winning Our Future. \"Romney's not the type to pump his own gas. Newt's got a plan for American-made energy. More American jobs. Get the government out of the way. Newt's for paychecks, not food stamps. Newt's my man, no doubt about it.\" While most superPAC ads throughout the primary season have been attacking candidates, Restore Our Future has been running a positive message in Ohio about Romney, whose approval ratings have plummeted since the primary season began. It highlights an episode when, as CEO of Bain Capital, Romney suspended the company's operations to find a missing girl, the daughter of an employee. \"Mitt's done a lot of things people say are nearly impossible, but for me, the most important thing he's ever done is to help save my daughter,\" says the employee. The ad closes with a voice saying, \"Restore Our Future is responsible for the content of this message.\" Kantar Media's Goldstein says it will be interesting to see, if Romney does restore his mantle of inevitability on Tuesday, how his ads and those of the superPAC that supports him might change. \"What's the strategy of the Romney campaign?\" Goldstein asks. \"What's the strategy of Restore Our Future? Do they go after President Obama, or do they take this chance to reintroduce their own guy to the American people after a pretty rocky last couple months?\" It's not just Republicans who have been spending money on Super Tuesday. Priorities USA Action, the superPAC that backs President Obama, spent a relatively small amount, some $77,000, on TV ads in Ohio, which will be a key swing state come the general election in November.",

            "article_content": "If you are a partisan Democrat, the announcement last week by Sen. Olympia Snowe (R-Maine) that she would not seek a fourth term is great news.  Her departure moves the seat from Safe Republican to Likely Democratic, and it hurts GOP efforts to win a Senate majority in November.  Nobody was going to beat Snowe this year, not in the primary (though she did have conservative opposition) nor in the general election.  In 2006, an awful year for Republicans nationwide, Snowe won re-election with 74 percent of the vote.  Her brand of moderate Republicanism plays well in this independent state. If you are a Tea Party Republican, her announcement is also great news.  Snowe, like her fellow Maine senator, Susan Collins, votes with Democrats and President Obama more often than any other Senate Republican.  Snowe is not a liberal in the true sense of the word.  She often threatens to bolt her party on key legislation but many times doesn't follow through.  But, as conservatives will remind you, she supports abortion rights, voted to confirm Elena Kagan to the Supreme Court, backed Obama's economic stimulus package, and as recently as 2008 had a 100 percent voting record with the AFL-CIO. But if you buy the argument is that Washington is not working because Democrats and Republicans refuse to talk to each other, or because compromise has become a dirty word, then the news about Snowe is disheartening.  Democrats will pick up a seat, and Republicans will be purer, but neither side will have learned the lesson. This aversion to cooperation is not just a Republican problem.  Years of preaching bipartisanship backfired on Blanche Lincoln (D-Ark.) in 2010, when the left wing of her party put up a strong opponent in the primary and nearly beat her.  Without a united party behind her, Lincoln got clobbered in her bid for a third term that fall.  And when Democratic centrists Ben Nelson (Neb.) and Joe Lieberman (Conn.) \u2014 Lieberman officially an independent \u2014 announced they wouldn't seek another term this year, there was no shortage of cheering from many in their party. On the Republican right, there are those who argue that the go-along-to-get-along philosophy that some say defined the House GOP for decades got them nowhere, that it took Newt Gingrich in 1994 to wake them out of their 40-year funk.  And it wasn't moderates that brought them back to control of the House in 2010, they'll remind us, it was the Tea Party and other conservatives. And on the Democratic left, there are those who blame members of their own party for giving President Bush the imprimatur to go to war in Iraq or cut taxes. The fact is, the combination of Tea Party victories in 2010, in the general election but especially in the primaries \u2014 think Christine O'Donnell over Mike Castle in Delaware \u2014 and the near decimation of the Blue Dog Democrats that fall have made the parties more ideologically pure than ever. And that's either good or bad, depending on your point of view. According to Snowe, that's not good.  In a Sunday op-ed in the Washington Post, she wrote: The Senate of today routinely jettisons regular order, as evidenced by  the body's failure to pass a budget for more than 1,000 days; serially  legislates by political brinkmanship, as demonstrated by the  debt-ceiling debacle of August that should have been addressed the  previous January; and habitually eschews full debate and an open  amendment process in favor of competing, up-or-down, take-it-or-leave-it  proposals. We witnessed this again in December with votes on two separate proposals for a balanced-budget amendment to the Constitution. ... One difficulty in making the Senate work the way it was intended is that  America's electorate is increasingly divided into red and blue states,  with lawmakers representing just one color or the other. Before the 1994  election, 34 senators came from states that voted for a presidential  nominee of the opposing party. That number has dropped to just 25  senators in 2012. The result is that there is no practical incentive for  75 percent of the senators to work across party lines. The great challenge is to create a system that gives our elected  officials reasons to look past their differences and find common ground  if their initial party positions fail to garner sufficient support. In a  politically diverse nation, only by finding that common ground can we  achieve results for the common good. That is not happening today and,  frankly, I do not see it happening in the near future. For change  to occur, our leaders must understand that there is not only strength in  compromise, courage in conciliation and honor in consensus-building \u2014  but also a political reward for following these tenets. That reward will  be real only if the people demonstrate their desire for politicians to  come together after the planks in their respective party platforms do  not prevail. The reaction in the mainstream media was predictable \u2014 but worth reading.  The New York Times' Frank Bruni explained his \"crush\" on Snowe this way: We liked her best for her disobedience. Unlike  the majority of her colleagues in the Senate, be they Democrats or,  like her, Republicans, she dared to disagree with her party. Often. And  she did it publicly, with her votes and her forthright explanations of  them. ... Just because you  identified yourself principally with one side in the ceaseless fight,  wearing an R or a D, it didn't mean you signed on automatically to  everything it championed, to each plank in its sprawling (and often  suffocating) platform. ... Just because you choose a team shouldn't mean you're suddenly  and miraculously on board with everything in its playbook, on down the  line: the abortion position, the contraception position, the  tax policy, the immigration policy, the attitude toward same-sex  marriage, the attitude toward gun control. But that's what's expected. That's the message gleaned from the relative  homogeneity of a party's leading candidates, who squeeze themselves  into tidy, unyielding boxes and insist that we do likewise. Rare is the  Democrat of plausible national ambition who tangles in a tough,  meaningful way with labor unions or environmentalists, groups that  President Obama has been loath to cross. Disappointing them jeopardizes  the campaign infantry and financial contributions they provide, and as  the sway of interest groups rises, the fealty of politicians to the ones  in their corner grows with it. Rare is the Republican of plausible national ambition who doesn't kowtow  to religious conservatives, a spectacle on florid display during the  Republican primaries, including last week, when Mitt Romney signaled support for the Blunt amendment just before Senate Democrats \u2014 with an assist from Snowe \u2014 defeated it.  He may not quite be lighting his hair on fire, to cite his own boast of  faux defiance, but there's ample smoke rising from his fabled mane, as  he burns away the Northeastern moderate he was. In fact he used to be  Snowe \u2014 minus the obvious differences in gender, religion, wealth and  pet care. But that was before he reached higher. Before he had much of  the independence and many of the idiosyncrasies bled out of him. Before  the Republican margin gobbled up the middle and ate a good chunk of Mitt  along with it. And in looking at Redstate.com for reaction to Snowe's retirement, I found this blog post by \"davenj1\": While many in the conservative  community may be celebrating to chants of \"good riddance\" and \"goodbye  RINO,\" he[r] departure puts a serious dent in the ability of the GOP to win  the Senate in 2012.  Considering the fact that there is nobody waiting  in the wings in Maine for the GOP with a filing deadline looming, the  timing could not have been worse.  Thus far, only a Tea Party activist  named D'Amboise is running.  He is the Maine equivalent of Christine  O'Donnell, only without the witchcraft and masturbation side stories.   Should either of the incumbent House members- Penigree or Michaud-  decide on a Senate run (both are seriously considering that option now),  it is all over in Maine.  And the fact is that a Democrat would replace  either one of them in the vacated House seat. But there was also this post, on the Conservatives for America blog, from \"Sister Toldjah,\" that expressed a more common reaction from the right: I didn't think we had a chance in you-know-where that we'd pick up  the Senate this year, and Snowe's retirement makes the likelihood of  that happening even more remote.  And while on one hand it's good to  have around even a moderate Republican like Snowe for most procedural  votes, it's important to remember that even the procedural vote pluses  are canceled out when colossal errors in judgement \u2013 like her decision to vote ObamaCare out of committee, which set it up for eventual passage \u2013 become all too common. And conservative commentator Michelle Malkin added this succinct thought on her blog: DLTDHYOTWO! Olympia Snowe is not and has never been a \"pure\" Republican.  But she was a Republican.  I suspect that there have been votes she made against the majority of her party that pained her, just as I suspect there have been votes made with the majority of her party that pained her as well.  I suspect that even as she may have moved to the right in recent years, at least since Obama has been in the White House, it has never been enough for some in the party.  And I suspect she grew tired of it all. Some of the moderate/liberal Republicans in the Senate as of 1978.  It's hard to imagine any of them in the Senate of 2012.\n                \n                    \n                    Ken Rudin collection\n                    \n                \nhide caption The campaign. Snowe's decision, which came two weeks ahead of the March 15 filing deadline, threw both parties for a loop.  But the Democratic bench in Maine seems to be stronger, and they go into the race as the favorite. She ran and lost in 2002, and is all but certain to try again this year.\n                \n                    \n                    Ken Rudin collection\n                    \n                \nhide caption While a few candidates were already running, Snowe's withdrawal immediately energized supporters of the state's two members of the House, both Democrats: Michael Michaud and Chellie Pingree.  Ultimately Michaud, who comes from the more rural part of the state, decided to stay in the House.  Pingree, who is considered more liberal, is all but a certain Senate candidate.  She ran once before; as the Democratic nominee in 2002, she lost by 17 points to Collins.  Former Gov. John Baldacci has also expressed interest in running. On the Republican side, businessman Scott D'Amboise, with Tea Party backing, had already been running.  State Senate President Kevin Raye, a former chief of staff to Snowe, talked about getting in the race but decided against it.  (He will instead take on Michaud in the 2nd CD, a rematch of their close 2002 race.)  Those who look ready to run include Secretary of State Charlie Summers, state Treasurer Bruce Poliquin, ex-state Senate President Rick Bennett, state  Sen. Debra Plowman and state Attorney General William Schneider. And let's not forget about potential independent candidates.  Maine, more than most states, seems to look favorably at independent and third-party candidates.  Maine was Ross Perot's best state in the two times he ran.  In 1992, with a shade over 30 percent of the vote, he even finished second, some 300 votes ahead of President George H.W. Bush.  The state also elected two independent governors in recent years, Jim Longley in 1974 and Angus King for two terms beginning in 1994.  King, in fact, is also talking about running, as is Eliot Cutler, the independent who narrowly lost to Paul LePage in the 2010 gubernatorial race.  Independents have until June 1 to file their candidacies, but a decision by King and/or Cutler is expected soon.  King was quoted in the Bangor Daily News as saying, \"To be honest, I am trying to figure out whether I can make a difference  down there.  If I can, then it is worth it ... But I  don't need to be a senator. Is it possible to make a difference or is  it hopeless down there?\" Ohio Silver! Along with the hotly contested Republican presidential primary on Tuesday (March 6) \u2014 said to be a \"must win\" for Rick Santorum \u2014 Ohio becomes the first state in the 2012 cycle to hold congressional primaries as well.  State Treasurer Josh Mandel is favored to win the GOP nomination to take on Sen. Sherrod Brown (D).  Mandel, who is 34 years old, has raised nearly $6 million and garnered strong conservative support in his uphill battle against Brown, who is seeking a second term. House primaries to watch: 3rd CD: This is a new seat, encompassing most of Columbus and likely to elect a Democrat in November, even though it's a product of GOP mapmakers.  It was designed to put as many Democrats together in one district in order to protect three nearby Republicans.  Mary Jo Kilroy (D), who served in Congress for one term before being crushed by Steve Stivers (R-15th) in 2010, is seeking redemption in this new district.  But she faces tough opposition from former state House Democratic leader Joyce Beatty, an African American who has the endorsement of Columbus Mayor Coleman; and state Rep. Ted Celeste, the brother of ex-Gov. Richard Celeste who was clobbered by Sen. Mike DeWine (R) in 2000. 9th CD: The Democratic primary pits two veteran incumbents:  Marcy Kaptur and Dennis Kucinich.  Former allies, they are now trashing each other in debates and in campaign ads.  Kucinich, a former mayor of Cleveland who has been in the House since 1997, is well known for his two bids for president and fervent anti-war reputation.  But he is thought to be at a disadvantage in his race with Kaptur, first elected in 1982 from Toledo and the senior woman in the House.  He has the more familiar name but the new combined district is more familiar to her, and she has a huge lead in fundraising.  And while Kaptur is used to winning big \u2014 she was down to 59 percent in 2010 but surpassed 70 percent in 11 of her previous 12 campaigns \u2014 Kucinich has struggled recently, accused of focusing more on national issues than concerns at home.  In 2010 he won an eighth term with just 53 percent. 10th CD: Actually, there is no primary here worth watching, but there could have been.  Rep. Steve Austria (R), whose district got dismantled and was thrown in the same CD as fellow Republican incumbent Mike Turner.  Rather than run against Turner in the primary, Austria decided to retire. History of Super Tuesday.  As we await the results of presidential contests in ten states on March 6 (see calendar at end of column for list of states), it might be worth taking a look at how \"Super Tuesday\" came to be.  The name first appeared in 1984, in a series of primaries on the same day in March mostly in the South.  But after Walter Mondale's blow-out defeat that fall, Southern Democrats decided that if they were ever going to retake the White House, their nominee needed to run strongly in the South.  So the \"real\" Super Tuesday was created, with many primaries held on the same day in Southern states in 1988, designed to give the party a less liberal focus. Many Southern Democrats who helped create Super Tuesday wanted Georgia Sen. Sam Nunn to run for president, but he refused. \n                \n                    \n                    Ken Rudin collection\n                    \n                \nhide caption But which Democrat got the most votes on Super Tuesday that year?  Jesse Jackson.  Which Dem got the most delegates?  Michael Dukakis (three more than Jackson).  Not exactly what they planned.  Sen. Al Gore of Tennessee, the supposed beneficiary of a strategy based mostly in the South, didn't do poorly \u2014 he finished a respectable third in both votes and delegates that day \u2014 but he finished third.  And he was out of the race not long afterwards. And while Democrats created Super Tuesday with the idea of helping their party, it really played a major role in determining the GOP nominee that year; Vice President George Bush won 16 primaries on that day.  Within two days of Super Tuesday, Jack Kemp (R) and Gary Hart (D) threw in the towel. Since then, it has aided the party frontrunners and helped end the candidacies of others. 1992:  President Bush (R) and Arkansas Gov. Bill Clinton (D) are the big winners.  Bush sweeps every primary, defeating commentator Pat Buchanan (and David Duke) and ending any question that he would be renominated. On the Democratic side, Clinton also cleans up in the South, with former Sen. Paul Tsongas of Massachusetts limited to primary wins in his home state and Rhode Island. 1996:  Bob Dole (R), his nomination thought to be in jeopardy after a weak win in Iowa and a loss in New Hampshire, sweeps the South.  Steve Forbes, who spent some $30 million of his own money, drops out of the race two days later. 2000:  Al Gore (D) and George W. Bush (R) clean up.  Two days later, Bill Bradley (D) and John McCain (R) are out of the race. 2004: John Kerry (D) wins nine of the day's 10 contests; his only loss comes in Vermont, where favorite son Howard Dean, who dropped out two weeks prior, won.  John Edwards (D) ends his candidacy the next day. 2008: On the Republican side, John McCain wins nine of the 21 states, including California, New York and Illinois.  Mike Huckabee sweeps the South.  Mitt Romney (R) drops out two days later.  For the Democrats, Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton essentially battle to a draw.  He wins 13 states to her nine, but she wins big in delegate-rich California and New York.  For the first time in 20 years, Super Tuesday fails to decide the Democratic contest. The 2012 story so far: Mitt Romney (7 states won): New Hampshire (1/10), Florida (1/31), Nevada (2/4), Maine (2/11), Arizona (2/28), Michigan (2/28), Washington (3/3) = 203 delegates. Rick Santorum (3):  Iowa (1/3), Minnesota (2/7), Colorado (2/7) = 92 delegates. Newt Gingrich (1): South Carolina (1/31) = 33 delegates. Ron Paul (0) = 25 delegates. Delegate total as of March 4 according to Associated Press.  A total of 1,144 delegates are needed to win the nomination. Sun Valley visit. A wonderful time was had by all (or maybe just me?) for a couple of days last week in Sun Valley, Idaho, in a series of events designed to spread the NPR gospel and talk about the StateImpact project I am involved with.  It's a project involving NPR and member stations in eight states \u2014 including Idaho \u2014 designed to focus on how the actions of state government affect people and their communities.  A big thanks to the NPR development team and Boise State Public Radio general manager John Hess for making the trip a huge success. Meanwhile, one of my trivia questions of the week \u2014 who was the last Idahoan elected governor and senator? \u2014 was correctly answered by Bob Kustra, who happens to be the president of Boise State University.  Kustra is a former state legislator and lt. gov. of Illinois, which is as good a reason as any to display this button from one of his old campaigns.  (Trivia answer: Dirk Kempthorne.)

Time for one quick question regarding the situation in Maine that was posted on my Facebook page: Q:  Can  Sen. Susan Collins resign and run for the seat of Olympia Snowe while the  Republican governor fills the Collins vacancy? \u2014 Diganta Das, Boyds, Md. A:  Theoretically, yes, and it's a fun scenario, but it's not going to happen.  The closest instance to that I can think of came in North Dakota in 1992.  Kent Conrad, a one-term Democrat, promised that he would not seek re-election unless the federal budget deficit was dramatically reduced.  It wasn't \u2014 in fact, it increased \u2014 and so Conrad kept his promise, announcing in April of that year he would retire.  Rep. Byron Dorgan became the Democratic nominee for the seat. However, the state's senior senator, Quentin Burdick (D), died on Sept. 8.  Democrats immediately pressured Conrad to run for Burdick's seat, and he agreed to do so.  He said he kept his word but that Burdick's death was a \"new situation.\"  Both he and Dorgan were elected that fall.  Political Junkie segment on Talk of the Nation.

Ohio is one of 10 states holding contests to pick their party's presidential nominee on Super Tuesday, but it has been the main focus of attention for GOP candidates because it will be a major battleground state in the general election this November. The conventional wisdom has been that whoever takes Ohio in the general election goes on to win the White House, which gives Tuesday's contest a lot of potential momentum for the eventual winner. In Ohio, NPR's Tamara Keith has been checking the mood of voters like Matt Greene. He's still undecided, though he says he'll ultimately vote for one of the front-runners: Rick Santorum or Mitt Romney. \"Nobody's coming forth with everything that I'd like to hear,\" Greene says. \"Santorum and Romney ... they both tend to put their foot in their mouth too often.\" The two other major Republican candidates still in the race are Newt Gingrich and Ron Paul. Greene says Santorum's views on faith and social issues appeal to him. But he's also concerned about the economy and feels the government should be run more like a business, which would favor Romney. Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney speaks at a town hall meeting at Capital University in Bexley, Ohio on Wednesday.\n                \n                    \n                    Gerald Herbert/AP\n                    \n                \nhide caption Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney speaks at a town hall meeting at Capital University in Bexley, Ohio on Wednesday. \"I believe in a lot of the things that Romney says,\" he says. \"I just don't know if he understands what the average man and woman needs.\" One Ohio Republican that Romney has not won over is Attorney General Mike DeWine. Although he endorsed Romney at one point, DeWine switched his support to Santorum last month. DeWine tells weekends on All Things Considered guest host Jacki Lyden that despite Romney's recent victories in Washington state, Arizona and Michigan, he does not regret his decision. \"There's a reason we have all of these caucuses and primaries and debates,\" DeWine says, \"and as the campaign has played out it has become very clear to me that [Romney] is not the strongest candidate.\" Around Ohio, DeWine says he's seen little enthusiasm for Romney. The enthusiasm he sees is for Santorum, and a win Tuesday would mean a lot. \"Ohio is a microcosm of the country; it's a reflection of the country,\" he says. \"We always are right in the center of the general election and this time we're right in the center in the primaries.\" At a recent Santorum event, Jessica Kramer of Mentor, Ohio, said  she's not sure she can support him just yet. \"I really need to know that he's going to be a true fiscal conservative, and that's kind of why I am leaning more towards Ron Paul,\" Kramer says. Cleveland Plain Dealer political reporter Henry Gomez says only two issues matter to Buckeye voters: jobs and the economy. \"The recession hit parts of Ohio particularly bad,\" Gomez tells NPR's Lyden. \"Things are starting to show signs of improvement ... but there's a lot of angst about income, about jobs and long-term economic stability.\" Based on some early voting numbers, Gomez says Republican voter turnout might be up over 2008, but support is still split among the candidates. \"So [voters are] galvanized, they're just not all galvanized behind one candidate and that can be a problem when they want to beat Barack Obama in November,\" he says. Ohio voter Ed Ely of Painesville simply wants the candidates to put their differences aside and come together. \"Because really ... the big picture is that we're going after the White House in 2012 [and] not going against each other,\" Ely says. \"And if we go against each other, nothing is going to get done.\" Regardless of how Ohio turns out on Tuesday, Ely isn't likely to get his wish anytime soon, because it looks like this primary fight will be raging well after Tuesday's contests.",

            "article_content": "Georgia holds the biggest delegate prize next week on Super Tuesday. It's also a critical test for the candidacy of former Speaker Newt Gingrich, who represented a Georgia Congressional district for two decades.  ROBERT SIEGEL, HOST: Super Tuesday is just four days away and, of all the states voting that day, Georgia has the most delegates at stake. Georgia is Newt Gingrich's adopted home state where he represented the 6th Congressional District for 20 years. NPR's Kathy Lohr reports that Gingrich has spent much of the week in Georgia because he knows it is crucial for him to win there. KATHY LOHR, BYLINE: Gingrich's bus tour stopped in Rome, Georgia, up north and in Savannah on the eastern side of the state, but the former speaker is perhaps most at home in Cobb County in the Atlanta suburbs, where he lambasted his GOP opponents. NEWT GINGRICH: I mean, one's Massachusetts moderate baloney and the other's Pennsylvania big labor baloney, but they're baloney. You know, they're not going to fundamentally change Washington. (SOUNDBITE OF APPLAUSE) LOHR: Speaking to a business crowd, Gingrich said winning here on Super Tuesday is key. GINGRICH: I have to win Georgia, I think, to be credible in the race. But if I win Georgia, the following week we go to Alabama and Mississippi. I think I'll win both of those. LOHR: In fact, the superPAC supporting Gingrich has already spent more than $1 million on advertising in those two states and nearly $2 million on TV and radio ads in Georgia. That's according to an NPR analysis of federal election filings. While the former speaker himself is hitting his message hard in Georgia, former Pennsylvania Senator Rick Santorum didn't mention Gingrich at a stop in Atlanta. Instead, Santorum targeted Mitt Romney for not being a true conservative. RICK SANTORUM: Ladies and gentlemen, you want someone who, at their core, believes and is willing to step up and fight, not put these issues on the back burner. LOHR: Santorum highlighted Romney's recent comments on an amendment which would have allowed insurance companies to opt out of providing contraceptives or other treatment if they have a moral objection. During one interview, Romney said he opposed the measure. Later, the former Massachusetts governor said he misunderstood. Still, Santorum pounced. SANTORUM: But I'll tell you, if I was asked a question like that, my gut reaction would be, always, my gut reaction would be, you stand for the First Amendment. You stand for freedom of religion. You stand for the First Amendment rights. LOHR: Santorum and Gingrich are fighting for the same conservative voters, but the business community here has largely backed Romney. At a Gingrich campaign event this week, some who like the former speaker say they're still undecided. Katrina Kaiser works in regional sales at a credit union. KATRINA KAISER: Either way, I'm hopeful that either Newt or Romney, that we'll have one of those two. LOHR: That may be a problem for the Gingrich campaign with you saying that. KAISER: I know. I know it is, but I am a Republican, so that's where my vote's going to go. You know, a lot of people I know are still on the fence, so... LOHR: And longtime Gingrich supporter Gail Holman(ph) says she knows her candidate has an uphill battle. GAIL HOLMAN: I just don't know that he's got enough force at this point and I'm not sure his money's going to last. And we all know that money is the necessary evil we've got to have to win elections. LOHR: After wins in Arizona and Michigan, Mitt Romney did not stop in Georgia this week, but sent his wife Ann to the Smoke Jack Restaurant, a barbecue place in the Atlanta suburbs that was jam-packed with an overflow crowd outside. Ann Romney said the campaign is not conceding Georgia, but fighting for every vote. ANN ROMNEY: And it's a big day on Tuesday and we are hoping that people will figure out that Mitt's message is an economic message, that he is the right person at the right time to turn this country around and to turn this economy around. LOHR: The latest polls show Gingrich is leading in Georgia, but far behind Romney and Santorum in national polls and in other Super Tuesday contests. ALAN ABRAMOWITZ: Gingrich has put almost all of his marbles right now on Georgia. LOHR: Alan Abramowitz is a political science professor at Emery University. ABRAMOWITZ: The reality is that if Gingrich loses in Georgia or even if he wins in Georgia and nowhere else and does poorly in the other Southern primaries, I think he's going to have to rethink his campaign. LOHR: To rally support, Gingrich has continued to focus on beating President Obama and on his plan to reduce gas prices. When a voter asked the former speaker what he'd do if he did lose his home state, Gingrich said... GINGRICH: I'm counting on all of my many friends to make sure I don't lose Georgia. LOHR: In a sign of Gingrich's confidence in his lead here, the former speaker will campaign this weekend in Ohio, another important Super Tuesday state. Kathy Lohr, NPR News, Atlanta.

            "article_content": "Rick Santorum campaigned in Ohio Friday, ahead of the state's critical primary on Super Tuesday. On its face, Ohio would seem to be fertile ground for Santorum with its large numbers of evangelicals and Tea Party supporters. But Santorum faces a steep challenge \u2014 Romney and a superPAC supporting him are dramatically outspending all the candidates on the TV and radio airwaves.  ROBERT SIEGEL, HOST: From NPR News, this is ALL THINGS CONSIDERED. I'm Robert Siegel. AUDIE CORNISH, HOST: And I'm Audie Cornish. We kick off this hour with a couple of numbers to keep in mind. SIEGEL: Ten, that's the number of states holding Republican presidential primaries or caucuses next Tuesday. CORNISH: Sixty-six, that's the number of delegates up for grabs in Ohio. It's one of Super Tuesday's biggest prizes. SIEGEL: And that's why you'll find the candidates making frequent visits there. Rick Santorum, in particular, is hoping that the conservative base in Ohio will rally to his cause. CORNISH: But the latest polls from Ohio show a narrowing in the big lead Santorum has enjoyed. NPR's national political correspondent, Don Gonyea, sent this story from Ohio. DON GONYEA, BYLINE: If Santorum had won Michigan, it would have been a huge boost to his campaign. Now, he wants, perhaps even needs, a win in Ohio to restore some momentum and prove that he can still be a real contender. So today, he's back in the state, even as Super Tuesday demands that he also campaign around the country, as well. This afternoon, he was in Chillicothe, south of the capital, Columbus. RICK SANTORUM: Great to be in Ohio, the center of the political universe in America. It's great to be here. GONYEA: And if people can't see Santorum in person in Ohio in the run-up to Super Tuesday, he's all over the airwaves in interviews with local radio stations. This is from WTAM in Cleveland. UNIDENTIFIED MAN 1: I am told we are joined live by Senator Rick Santorum for the next couple. Sir, good morning, I appreciate your time, first of all. I know you're busy. SANTORUM: Well, great. Great to be with you. Thank you for... GONYEA: And Santorum is getting help from outside groups running ads on his behalf, including the conservative Susan B. Anthony list. (SOUNDBITE OF AD) GONYEA: Santorum's stump speech hasn't changed. He's still attacking Mitt Romney as too moderate, for not being a true conservative and he's going after President Obama. He is mixing economic populism, saying he'll help the little guy, with lots of talk about family values and social issues. Sixty-three-year-old Pam Caltenback(ph) was at the Chillicothe rally with her husband. PAM CALTENBACK: We're Catholics, so the issue of the government butting in on the birth control issue really bothers me. UNIDENTIFIED MAN 2: He counts is as, like, the federal government, the Obama administration's war on religion and the Catholic Church, you\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 CALTENBACK: And I agree with that. GONYEA: Santorum almost won Michigan with a coalition of Tea Party members, Evangelical voters and those who just don't like or trust Mitt Romney. In Ohio, he's helped by the fact that Romney is no longer in his home state. Here's University of Akron political scientist David Cohen. DAVID COHEN: In Ohio, other than running for president in 2008 and 2012, nobody would know who this guy was. He has no ties to Ohio. GONYEA: But a negative for Santorum is Newt Gingrich, who did not contest Michigan at all. Ohio is a different story. Tune in to an hour of conservative talk radio in the state and you'll hear a heavy rotation of ads in support of Gingrich paid for by the Winning Our Future superPAC. This ad goes after Mitt Romney and Santorum. (SOUNDBITE OF AD) GONYEA: Romney, meanwhile, is also running ads targeting Santorum's record and the fact that while in Congress he voted for bills that included funding for Planned Parenthood. Then, there is another obstacle for Santorum in Ohio. He's paying the price for a campaign that is long on enthusiasm, but short on organization. In three of Ohio's 16 congressional districts, he didn't meet requirements to get fully on the ballot, so he's not eligible to win delegates in those districts. Again, David Cohen. COHEN: Which means that, you know, Santorum comes into election night with a deficit of nine delegates. Now, can he make that up? Absolutely. But he is at a slight disadvantage because his campaign operation really wasn't up to speed in order to file the proper paperwork to get on the ballot everywhere. GONYEA: Still, Cohen says, there's a big opportunity for Santorum. Ohio, as a whole, and Ohio Republicans in particular, are more conservative than their counterparts in the Great Lakes State to the north. The question, however, is if the former senator's campaign is able to take advantage of that. Don Gonyea, NPR News, Chillicothe, Ohio. Copyright \u00a9 2012 NPR.  All rights reserved.

In a move certain to bring even more attention to one of the latest media tempests, President Obama on Friday got on the phone to encourage the Georgetown University law student disparaged by conservative radio superstar Rush Limbaugh with misogynistic epithets. Visit msnbc.com for breaking news, world news, and news about the economy Sandra Fluke, who is also an activist, was about to appear on MSNBC's  Andrea Mitchell Reports when she took a phone call from the White House. It was the president. As an emotional Fluke explained once she was in front of the cameras with Mitchell: FLUKE: \"He encouraged me and supported me and thanked me for speaking out about the concerns of American women. And what was really personal for me was that he said to tell my parents that they should be proud. And that meant a lot because Rush Limbaugh questioned whether or not my family should be proud of me.\" At the White House news briefing, press secretary Jay Carney explained: \"The president called... because he wanted to offer his support to her.  He wanted to express his disappointment that she has been the subject of inappropriate personal attacks and to thank her for exercising her rights as a citizen to speak out on an issue of public policy.  And it was a \u2014 it was a very good conversation. REPORTER:  Is that all you can tell us about the conversation? MR. CARNEY:  Well, I mean, I think so.  It wasn't \u2014 you know, it was several minutes.  They had a very good conversation.  I think he, like a lot of people, feels that the kinds of personal attacks that she's \u2014 that have been directed her way are inappropriate.  It's \u2014 the fact that our political discourse is \u2014 has become debased in many ways is bad enough.  It is worse when it's directed at a private citizen who was simply expressing her views on a \u2014 on a \u2014 on a matter of public policy. REPORTER:  It is appropriate for Democratic organizations to try to raise money off of the \u2014 this attack on her? MR. CARNEY:  I think that I'll leave that to the \u2014 whatever organizations might agree with her or sympathize with her.  The fact of the matter is the president was expressing his support for her and his disappointment in the kind of attacks that had been leveled at her \u2014 to her, and his appreciation for her willingness to, you know, sort of stand tall and express her opinion. Fluke became embroiled in the controversy over the Obama administration's new policy on contraception and health insurance. It requires employers, including those with religious affiliations like schools and hospitals, to provide birth control at no cost to workers covered by group health insurance. Catholic bishops, religious groups have complained that the policy violates the conscience of people of faith who oppose birth-control. What makes the policy even worse in some eyes is that some forms of contraception and abortion is blurred. Supporters of the administration's policy had hoped that Fluke would be allowed to testify at a recent House hearing on the policy. But the GOP-controlled committee refused to let her testify. House Democrats, instead, held a meeting at which she was the star speaker. All of which eventually led to Limbaugh calling her a \"slut\" and \"prostitute\", which, for obvious reasons, set off a firestorm in its own right. While on a human level the president's phone can be interpreted as an act of kindness, because it was the president, there's also the larger political context of the issue being framed by Democrats as one in which they are the champions of women's health. It being a general election year and the president counting on getting enough of the women's vote to win re-election, his phone call takes on a bigger meaning. Comforting someone like Fluke who was targeted by Limbaugh for siding with Obama's contraception policy was the kind of symbolic act that could pay political dividends for the president come November.",

The Senate has turned back an attempt to kill President Obama's new rules requiring most health insurance plans to provide contraceptives without additional cost. The 51-48 vote against an amendment to an unrelated highway bill (Yes, that's just how the Senate works) was mostly along party lines. Missouri Republican Roy Blunt, the amendment's sponsor said its goal was a simple one. \"I believe what this does is protect First Amendment rights. The first freedom in the founding documents is freedom of religion,\" he said. The amendment would have allowed employers to opt out of the mandate to cover birth control. It was the latest in a series of collisions between the right to follow one's conscience and the demands of society. Senate Democrats, like New Jersey's Frank Lautenberg, said the amendment's language was so vague it would allow employers to deny coverage of any benefit to which they had a religious or moral objection. \"Imagine that your boss is going to decide whether or not you're acting morally,\" he said. The Obama administration weighed in on the language last night, with Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius calling it, \"a cynical attempt to roll back decades of progress in women's health.\" After the vote, the Coalition to Protect Women's Health Care, a consortium of women's health advocates, said in a statement, \"We believe, as do the majority of Americans, that health care decisions should  be made between doctors and patients, not employers.\" And there are fresh poll data out from the Kaiser Family Foundation that show that's the case.  Overall, 63 percent of Americans support the birth control coverage mandate. But among Republicans that support drops to 42 percent, according to the poll conducted last month.",

At  Nashville's  Belmont University, Santorum spoke about his own views of religious  freedom.  STEVE INSKEEP, HOST: So, by the end of the day, Romney said he agreed with conservative lawmakers on contraception. But as Rick Santorum campaigned in Tennessee, he seized on the confusion. Here's Blake Farmer of member station WPLN. BLAKE FARMER, BYLINE: In a press release, the Santorum camp took the opportunity to slam Romney for having a liberal record on freedom of religion.

Government can't give or take anything from you. (SOUNDBITE OF CHEERING AND APPLAUSE) FARMER: At times, Santorum's stump speech was met with boos from hecklers. But he continued to revisit thorny themes like the gap between rich and poor. SANTORUM: Look here in Nashville. There is great income inequality. Why? Because there are amazing talents in this town that soar and do great things and inspire great things in other people. And they are richly rewarded for it. And there are those who may work just as hard, but they don't succeed for one reason or another. FARMER: Rally attendee Pam Chaffin says she appreciates how Santorum speaks his mind, especially on social issues such as abortion.

            "article_content": "The Republican presidential candidates are focused on Super Tuesday. Ten states will have nominating contests next week. Former Massachusetts Governor Mitt Romney spent Wednesday campaigning in one of those states: Ohio.  STEVE INSKEEP, HOST: It's MORNING EDITION from NPR News. Good morning, I'm Steve Inskeep. RENEE MONTAGNE, HOST: And I'm Renee Montagne. The battle over social issues in the Republican presidential primaries has extended through most of another week. This time the flashpoint was a remark by Mitt Romney. The former Massachusetts governor said he opposed, and then clarified that he actually favors, legislation involving contraception. NPR's Tamara Keith reports it was not what Romney intended to discuss in Ohio. TAMARA KEITH, BYLINE: Mitt Romney's campaign unfurled a new banner at his event in the Columbus suburb of Bexley yesterday: More jobs, less debt, smaller government. It was a sure sign of Romney's desire to pivot back to the economy and move past social issues. After a short speech, Romney opened it up to questions from the audience, including this one. UNIDENTIFIED MAN: It seems like the media portrays you that you don't have a heart, that you're a man with a vast business knowledge. But I know you have a heart. KEITH: Asked to show he has heart, Romney talked about his wife and her diagnosis with MS, the joys of grandchildren, and his time as a lay pastor in the Mormon Church. And then he came back to his concern about the economy. MITT ROMNEY: If I were a doctor and I saw somebody who was obviously suffering from some condition, I'd want to do something to help. Well, my experience is not in medicine. My experience is in business, and I think that's what America needs right now. KEITH: But not long after the last question, an Internet firestorm broke out over something Romney said in a local TV interview before the event. Reporter Jim Heath of the Ohio News Network asked Romney about a controversial Senate amendment, supported by Rick Santorum, that would allow employers and insurers to opt out of covering contraceptives if they have a moral objection. (SOUNDBITE OF TV INTERVIEW) JIM HEATH: Blunt-Rubio is being debated, I believe, later this week, that deals with banning or allowing employers to ban providing female contraception. Have you taken a position on it? He said he was for that - we'll talk about personhood in a second. But he's for that - have you taken a position? ROMNEY: I'm not for the bill. But look, the idea of presidential candidates getting into questions about contraception within a relationship between a man and a women, husband and wife, I'm not going there. KEITH: Romney's campaign responded quickly, backing away from his answer. And Romney himself tried to clear things up on the Howie Carr Show, broadcast on WRKO in Boston. (SOUNDBITE OF RADIO SHOW) ROMNEY: I thought he was talking about some state law that prevented people from getting contraception, so I was simply \u2013 I misunderstood the question. And of course I support the Blunt amendment. KEITH: And once again, the conversation has strayed from the economy. Tamara Keith, NPR News, Columbus, Ohio. Copyright \u00a9 2012 NPR.

            "article_content": "Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney told  a reporter Wednesday  that he opposes a measure being considered by the Senate that  would allow employers to decline to provide contraception coverage to  women. \"I'm  not for the bill,\" Romney said during an interview with Ohio News  Network reporter Jim Heath. \"But, look, the idea of presidential candidates  getting into questions about contraception within a relationship between a man  and a woman, husband and wife, I'm not going  there.\" However, Romney's campaign quickly denied that the governor opposes the so-called  Blunt bill, charging that the question Heath asked was confusing. \"Gov. Romney supports the Blunt bill because he believes  in a conscience exemption in health care for religious institutions and people  of faith,\" Romney spokeswoman Andrea Saul said in a prepared  statement. The  differing accounts came on the eve of a planned Senate vote on the Blunt  amendment, which has prompted contentious debate both on and off Capitol  Hill. The  amendment is intended  to overturn Obama administration regulations that would require most health  insurance plans to provide FDA-approved contraceptives and sterilization  services with no additional copayment  or  deductible. But critics argue that the amendment is so  broadly written \u2014 allowing opt-outs for those with \"religious or moral  objections\" \u2014 that it would let employers decline to provide virtually any  health benefit for virtually any reason. Heath, reached by phone at  Ohio  News Network offices in Columbus, said his question to Romney was  clearly asked and was specifically about the Blunt  amendment. \"I explained the bill as allowing employers to  deny female contraception coverage,\" Heath said, characterizing the governor's  statement of opposition as \"exactly what he said.\" \"What I immediately thought, in all honesty,\" Heath  said, \"was that he was pivoting toward the middle, toward women voters\" who may  have been put off by Romney rival Rick Santorum's anti-contraception  views. \"I wasn't expecting a definitive answer,\" Heath said.  \"But having been covering this campaign for months now, I thought he must be  looking at Ohio and beyond, and how Santorum has been  raked over the coals on this issue.\" \"It was a very definitive response, combined with a slap  at Santorum,\" Heath said. \"I was surprised he went  there.\" Here's a transcript of the part of the interview that's  in dispute: HEATH: \"He's brought  contraception into this campaign. The issue of birth control, contraception,  Blunt-Rubio is being debated, I believe, later this week. It deals with banning  or allowing employers to ban providing female contraception. Have you taken a  position on it? [Santorum] said he was  for that, we'll talk about personhood in a second; but he's for that, have you  taken a position?\" ROMNEY: \"I'm not for the  bill, but look, the idea of presidential candidates getting into questions about  contraception within a relationship between a man and a women, husband and wife,  I'm not going there.\" HEATH: \"Surprised that  he went there?\" ROMNEY: \"You know, I  made it very clear when I was being interviewed by George Stephanopoulos in a  debate a while ago: Contraception is working just fine, let's just leave  it alone.\" HEATH: \"And the  Personhood Amendment could potentially be on the ballot in Ohio this fall. What's  your position on this effort, personhood?\" ROMNEY: \"Well it's  interpreted differently by different states, so I'd have to look at the  particular provision. We had a provision in my state that said that life began  at conception, that's a provision that I protected. The legislature passed a  bill saying that no longer would life be determined to begin at conception, I  vetoed that. So we can have a provision that describes life beginning when it in  fact begins. At the same time, allowing people to have  contraceptives.\" Update at 7:45 p.m. ET: The Romney campaign released audio and transcript in which it directly addressed the earlier comments. Romney made the comments on the Howie Carr Show on Wednesday. Here's the transcript: CARR: Listen I got to  ask you here about there's a \u2014 the Washington Post has got a blog out here,  saying that Jim Heath, a reporter for a TV station in Ohio just tweeted a  remarkable piece of news: Mitt Romney told him he does not support the Blunt  amendment which would empower employers and insurers to deny health coverage  they find morally objectionable. What happened here, did you  \u2013 ROMNEY: I didn't  understand his question, of course I support the Blunt amendment. I thought he  was talking about some state law that prevented people from getting  contraception so I was simply \u2014 misunderstood the question and of course I  support the Blunt amendment. CARR: Okay so that  should be taken off the table. ROMNEY: Yeah. CARR: That's running  around the world in ten seconds as you know that's how these things  go. ROMNEY: Yeah exactly  right. No, I simply misunderstood what he was talking about. I thought it was  some Ohio legislation that  \u2014 where employers were prevented from providing contraceptives, and so I talked  about contraceptives and so forth, so I really misunderstood the question. Of  course Roy Blunt who is my liaison to the Senate is someone I support and of  course I support that amendment. I clearly want to have religious exemption from  Obamacare. CARR: And Rubio is one  of your potential vice-presidential candidates is also \u2014 his name is also  attached to the bill and Scott Brown here in Massachusetts is  supporting it as well. ROMNEY: Yeah exactly, I  think every Republican is supporting it, and I actually understand that, I may  be wrong on this, but my recollection is that Ted Kennedy even wrote a note to  the Pope about religious exemptions from matters of this nature for purposes of  conscience. So this is something I really think all Americans ought to be able  to get around this religious  exemption. CARR: Yeah well you  haven't been around here lately but that's been a big controversy here with 'Patches' [Patrick] Kennedy saying that you know \u2014 telling Scott Brown, 'well you can't use my  father's letter to the Pope 'cause he was just sending a letter to the Pope he  didn't really believe anything he said in the letter.' I mean that's what it  boiled down to. ROMNEY: I must admit I  hope that when you send a letter to the Pope you believe what you wrote in  it.",

            "article_content": "Former Massachusetts governor Mitt Romney, who narrowly won Michigan's Republican primary on Tuesday, traveled south to campaign in Toledo, Ohio on Wednesday. Ohio holds its primary next week on Super Tuesday.  ROBERT SIEGEL, HOST: From NPR News, this is ALL THINGS CONSIDERED. I'm Robert Siegel. AUDIE CORNISH, HOST: And I'm Audie Cornish. With the Michigan and Arizona primaries in his rearview mirror, Mitt Romney sped off to Ohio today. That's one of the 10 states that will vote next week on Super Tuesday. In a few minutes, we'll measure the broader picture of the GOP nominating contest with some members of the Republican establishment. First, NPR's national political correspondent Don Gonyea caught up with last night's winner in Toledo. DON GONYEA, BYLINE: The small factory where Mitt Romney spoke is just a few miles from the Michigan/Ohio state line, a short drive for our candidates still basking in a very close win in the place where he grew up. MITT ROMNEY: Well, it was a big night last night for me. I was very pleased, very good news. Arizona and Michigan right next door... GONYEA: And Romney took special pride in this detail from yesterday's exit polls. ROMNEY: And interestingly, the people who said that the economy and jobs were their number one issue, they voted for me overwhelmingly. GONYEA: There was relief for Romney last night. A loss in Michigan would have been potentially devastating to his campaign. Instead, he was free today to all but ignore his GOP rivals and to keep the criticism focused on President Obama. The Toledo event wasn't designed as a big rally. The intent seemed to be to get Romney on TV campaigning in the state as Super Tuesday approaches. He spoke for just 12 minutes, but small business owner Ken Welcher(ph) liked what he heard. KEN WELCHER: He cues in on small business. Small business is the backbone of America. It's the job creator. Government doesn't create jobs. Small business, I'm the job creator. I'm the guy that gets - hires the workers. GONYEA: Also there was Tom Stamos(ph). He, too, is in business. He describes himself as a Republican, but also independent. He's watched debates and followed some coverage of the primaries, but now that the campaign has come to his state, he's only now starting to sort things out. TOM STAMOS: I am not making this up. I'm totally serious, but I am completely undecided even now. GONYEA: All in all, it seemed a routine day for Romney. He was clearly feeling good, then, as can happen on the campaign trail, suddenly there was an unexpected moment requiring damage control. Romney was doing a television interview with the Ohio News Network. He was asked about health coverage, contraception, and religious organizations. The interviewer is Jim Heath. In the following question to Romney, he's referring to Rick Santorum. JIM HEATH: (inaudible) Is being debated, I believe, later this week. That deals with banning or allowing employers to ban providing female contraception. Have you taken a position on that? He's said that he's for that \u00e2\u0080\u0093 and we'll talk about personhood in a second \u00e2\u0080\u0093 but he's for that. Have you taken a position on that? ROMNEY: I'm not for the bill. But, look, the idea of presidential candidates getting into questions about contraception within a relationship between a man and a woman, a husband and wife, I'm not going there. GONYEA: Romney's answer seemed to set him apart from the rest of the GOP field. But in the afternoon, the campaign issued a correction, with Romney himself saying he was confused by the wording of the question. A lesson for the Romney campaign in its very close victory in Michigan is that you can't take anything for granted - something this latest controversy underscores as well.

A next-day analysis of the Republican presidential primaries in Michigan and Arizona won by Mitt Romney underscores one of his weaknesses with his party's base, especially with the ascent of his now-chief rival Rick Santorum: He fares more poorly with born-again and evangelical voters than with nonevangelicals. It was particularly apparent in Michigan, according to exit poll results analyzed by the Pew Research Center's Forum on Religion & Public Life. Voters who were polled could describe themselves as born-again or evangelical, regardless of their religious affiliation. Fifty-one percent of self-described evangelicals in Michigan's primary voted for Santorum, Romney's top rival for the GOP nomination. Romney, who is Mormon, got 35 percent of that part of the evangelical vote. Thirty-nine percent of Republicans who marked ballots in Michigan on Tuesday were white, evangelical and Protestant, Pew reported. Support candidates received from self-described evangelical voters in previous 2012 primaries and caucuses. Source: Data analysis of exit polls from Pew Forum on Religion and Public Life Credit: Julia Ro And nonevangelical voters in Michigan's primary? Romney was the choice of 45 percent; 30 percent picked Santorum, who is Catholic. In Arizona, where 37 percent of those voting in the state's primary were identified as white evangelicals, Romney fared better. He and Santorum, Pew reports, were \"virtually tied\" in their race for the evangelical vote \u2014 35 percent for Romney, 37 percent for Santorum. Romney, however, crushed Santorum among Arizona's nonevangelical voters, 54 percent to 20 percent. In its analysis, Pew said Tuesday's contests continued Romney's pattern of support among evangelical voters. And it underscored the fact that Santorum continues to poll best among Republicans who say it matters a \"great deal\" that a candidate share their religious beliefs. The Santorum campaign, in a Wednesday conference call with reporters, sought to underscore Romney's difficulties in wooing the religious base. Though Santorum's focus on social issues that resonate with evangelical voters \u2014 from contraception to the separation of church and state \u2014 has been criticized by leaders in his own party, Santorum senior adviser John Brabender said the campaign welcomes discussion about the issues. \"We think everybody should be asked [about] social issues, \" he said. \"We don't mind the questions.\"",

            "article_content": "1 of 12 Rick Santorum and his campaign will likely look back on Michigan's 2012 primary not only as a heartbreaking loss in the battle against Mitt Romney but also as a historic lost opportunity. The upstart former senator from Pennsylvania was within a few percentage points of toppling the wobbly frontrunner in a state that really mattered. Unlike his earlier wins in caucus states (Iowa, Colorado, Minnesota) and a nonbinding \"beauty contest\" (Missouri), a win in Michigan meant a real cache of committed delegates. Moreover, as Romney's native state and home of his political clan, Michigan had been a cornerstone of his inevitability narrative. To lose it was unthinkable, but how much worse to lose it to Santorum \u2014 an also-ran ignored by rivals and reporters alike for months? The entire political industry had been poised for weeks for a Santorum breakthrough in Michigan, not quite believing it could happen but believing the polls that said it could. Even after a disappointing debate performance on Feb. 22 and a series of unforced errors, Santorum remained in close contention in Michigan. A win for him there would have transformed the conversation about this nomination. It is possible Romney would not have recovered. But that was not to be. In his zeal, Santorum dissed JFK's legendary 1960 speech on religion and called President Obama a \"snob\" for talking up college education. He also continued to pursue the issue of birth control and government, making his point about religious liberty but also highlighting his own traditional ideas about contraception. How much did these issues matter? In Michigan, Santorum nearly matched Romney vote for vote among men. But he lost by 5 percentage points among women. In the end, he lost the state by 3 percentage points. Did he get the message? You only had to hear his concession speech, in which he lavished praise on his wife and his college-educated mother, who made more than his dad. The word contraception did not feature in his lengthy remarks. This was not the first time this season that Santorum has blown a chance to turn the tide. In Iowa, he finished in a dead heat with Romney (a later count showed he had actually won by a handful of votes) but was unable to capitalize on that win a week later in New Hampshire (he finished fifth with less than 10 percent). full results He got the endorsement of a key group of evangelical heavyweights, who voted for him overwhelmingly at a mid-January meeting in Texas. Yet he made almost no use of their effort in losing South Carolina, where he came in a distant third. The news that Santorum had actually won the Iowa caucus on Jan. 3 was bad news for Romney. But it never really gave Santorum much of a lift. All that seemed to change on Feb. 7, when Santorum won the caucuses in Colorado and Minnesota and the nonbinding primary in Missouri. On the strength of this showing on \"Trifecta Tuesday,\" Santorum eclipsed Newt Gingrich as the leading anti-Romney candidate. Michigan gave him a perfect opening to make good on that placement. But as soon as the path became clear, Santorum seemed to wander off. The irony is that Santorum may still claim a share of the victory in Michigan. The delegates there are being allocated almost entirely by congressional district. So even in losing the statewide vote, Santorum could win narrow victories in seven or eight of the 14 congressional districts. If he does, he will have no worse than a tie in delegates won. But it will not matter so much once the cameras have moved on. What Santorum lost, one more time, was the chance to throw a knockout punch and have it land on Romney's big glass jaw. If Romney finally steadies himself and carries his reluctant Republican Party to victory in November, many will marvel at how close his candidacy came to collapse in February. Conversely, if the Rick Santorum phenomenon fades or falls apart in the weeks and months ahead, few may recall how close he came to knocking Romney off.",

            "article_content": "Arizona took the recession and the housing crisis on the chin. Now that the state's economy is starting to recover, it has Republican presidential candidates talking about other issues.  AUDIE CORNISH, HOST: Tomorrow, voters in Arizona will also go to the polls. Like Michigan, Arizona was hit hard during the great recession with unemployment peaking at twice the national average. But its economy is starting to turn around. And as NPR's Ted Robbins reports, that's changed the way Republicans are campaigning in the state. TED ROBBINS, BYLINE: Here's what Arizona voters are hearing from the candidates. This is from the Republican debate in Mesa. MITT ROMNEY: We have to have individuals that will stand up for religious conscience, and I did and I will again as president. RICK SANTORUM: I supported No Child Left Behind. I supported it. RON PAUL: You literally vote for abortion because Planned Parenthood gets the money... NEWT GINGRICH: We have to generally worry about nuclear weapons going off in our own cities. ROBBINS: What voters aren't hearing is much talk about a dismal economy, and there's a good reason why. LEE MCPHETERS: The economy really picked up in the second half of last year. ROBBINS: And Arizona State University economist Lee McPheters says the state's economy continues to improve. MCPHETERS: So you've got an economy that has turned around. And compared to other states, we're doing pretty well. I mean, you would certainly not say Arizona's in your bottom 10, bottom 20 states. ROBBINS: In fact, recent numbers have Arizona in the top 10 states for job growth in manufacturing, transportation and warehousing, even in construction. But the best sector for job growth, health care. Over the last year, health care accounted for a quarter of all new jobs. MCPHETERS: From the lower skilled, lower paid jobs all the way up to neurosurgeons and to scientific researchers. JASMINE BHATTI: Everyone that I know, they all have jobs. ROBBINS: Jasmine Bhatti graduated from a nursing program last May. She's now working as an RN at St. Joseph's Hospital in Phoenix. The need is there because the massive numbers of people who've moved to Arizona over the last 50 years are getting older. BHATTI: Obviously, we've got the generation of baby boomers coming in and they have the typical conditions associated with aging and chronic conditions. ROBBINS: Health care job growth could slow, though, later this year when coming cutbacks in state aid to the poor kick in. Most of the gains in construction jobs are for large single projects like this senior housing going up in Tucson and the world's largest semiconductor factory, which Intel is building in Chandler. Now, Arizona still has one of the nation's highest foreclosure rates. Half of all mortgages in the Phoenix area are under water. But there's even a bit of good news on that front. Investors seem to be buying up foreclosed properties and a recent report from Arizona State University says Phoenix home values are inching their way up again after hitting a low last September. ASU economist Lee McPheters. MCPHETERS: This year, 2012 is going to be better than last year on every indicator. There will be more single family housing starts. There will be more home sales. There will be more jobs created. It's just at a very, very slow pace compared to what is average or typical for Arizona coming out of a recession. ROBBINS: McPheters predicts that it will be two or three more years before the state's economy gets back to pre-recession levels. But there is no doubt Arizona's economy is slowly improving. That's changed the emphasis of the Republican primary campaign in Arizona. What's on top of voters' minds we'll find out tomorrow. Ted Robbins, NPR News, Tucson. Copyright \u00a9 2012 NPR.

Mitt Romney is ahead of Santorum among Catholic voters in the state, despite the fact that Santorum is Catholic.\n                \n                    \n                    Scott Olson/Getty Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption Rick Santorum signs Joe Boulus' apron at a Lenten fish fry Friday in Michigan. Mitt Romney is ahead of Santorum among Catholic voters in the state, despite the fact that Santorum is Catholic. Presidential candidates Mitt Romney and Rick Santorum are neck-and-neck in the polls in the run-up to the Michigan Republican primary on Tuesday. One group that Romney appears to have an advantage with is Roman Catholic voters despite the fact that he is Mormon and Santorum Catholic. The disconnect between faith and politics highlights differences among Catholics and shows that some religious voters are focusing more on other issues. Declaring Faith Santorum doesn't shy away from letting people know that he's a man of faith. He visited the Knights of Columbus hall in Lincoln Park on Friday. The Knights of Columbus is a fraternal service group, sort of like a Catholic version of groups like the Shriners. Santorum is a member, and his faith a central theme in his campaign.  \"I'm a Catholic, and I'm told that one of the responsibilities of the Church is to care for those who are the least among us,\" he said, \"and I believe that, and that's a real responsibility for all of us.\" According to Public Policy Polling, Santorum's faith and image as a family man give him a boost in Michigan with Protestants, Evangelicals and those who consider themselves \"very conservative.\" Some national polls differ, though. Romney leads the field with moderates, \"somewhat conservative\" voters and Catholics, according to the Public Policy poll.  \"There's a lot of complexity there,\" says John Green, a political science professor at the University of Akron. \"Religion and politics often line up, but they don't always correlate perfectly.\" The Catholic Spectrum Green says you can think of Catholicism on a continuum.  \"There is ... what we might call the orthodoxy of religious beliefs, and someone like Sen. Santorum is a very orthodox Catholic in terms of religion. He holds very closely to the traditional teachings of the Church,\" he says. That continuum moves from the very traditional to the nontraditional.  \"Some Catholic conservatives, or liberals for that matter, may be turned off by a fellow parishioner or a Catholic candidate who is self-consciously a traditionalist,\" he says. Green says until the 1960s, regardless of where Catholics stood on that continuum, they tended to vote as a group for Democrats. But as Catholics \u2014 many of whom were recent immigrants \u2014 began to assimilate and become more accepted, their views on politics began to splinter. You can see that diversity of thought at almost any parish. Religion Takes A Back Seat Few things say \"Midwestern Roman Catholic\" like a Lenten Friday night fish fry. At St. William's Parish in Walled Lake, Mich., nearly 1,000 parishioners and their friends line up for fish fry, shrimp and cheese pizza.  \"It's endless refills, so you can literally let the fat kid inside of you out and eat as much as you want,\" says Katie Goebel, whose father runs the fish fry. She's not just here for the fish; she's also here to see Santorum. Goebel hasn't made up her mind who to vote for, but her faith plays a role. \"I will admit it does play a big role on issues like on contraception, abortion, things like that. But other things, like marriage and all that, I'm sort of up in the air,\" she says. \"You know, people more [in] my generation, we're seeing things like gay marriage and stuff like that as OK.\" Jan Artushin and her husband both attend mass regularly, and they're both undecided. \"I think we have to focus on the economy and jobs,\" she says. \"I think that the religious issues ... [are] taking a back step because I think we're in such dire straights right now.\" Green, the professor, says Catholics vote in many ways like other groups. Electability trumps faith \u2014 at least at this stage.",

Romney is often likened to his father George, the former Michigan governor, but shares many defining traits, like reserve and caution, with his mother, Lenore, who once ran for a U.S. Senate seat and, like her son, failed in that effort. Despite his strictly conservative views opposing contraception, abortion and government-paid prenatal screenings, Rick Santorum has gained ground, according to a Washington Post-ABC News poll, with Republican women. A top House Republican fundraiser, Rep.

            "article_content": "The four remaining rivals for the GOP presidential nomination debated in Mesa, Ariz., Wednesday night, ahead of next week's primary. It was the first debate in which Rick Santorum was featured as the main threat to former front-runner Mitt Romney. Rep. Ron Paul kept up his own line of fire against Santorum.  RENEE MONTAGNE, HOST: This is MORNING EDITION from NPR News. Good morning. I'm Renee Montagne. STEVE INSKEEP, HOST: And I'm Steve Inskeep. The most popular political TV series in years had one more episode last night. Republicans held the latest of many debates, this time in Arizona, and for now this stands as a last look. The candidates have not yet committed to any additional debates, as more than a dozen states vote in the next couple of weeks. Last night on CNN, the four candidates sat next to each other at a table, which brought the long-time frontrunner Mitt Romney shoulder-to-shoulder with Rick Santorum, the latest man to challenge him. NPR's Ari Shapiro was there. ARI SHAPIRO, BYLINE: Mitt Romney's frontrunner status has been threatened before, most recently by Newt Gingrich. In previous debates, Romney responded to that threat by eviscerating Gingrich. Last night it was Rick Santorum's turn in the dock, and Romney used his answer to the very first question to savage Santorum's record as a fiscal conservative. (SOUNDBITE OF DEBATE) SHAPIRO: He continued through a laundry list of votes Santorum made as a senator from Pennsylvania, supporting the education program No Child Left Behind and funding for Planned Parenthood. Santorum replied that Romney was no better. (SOUNDBITE OF DEBATE) SHAPIRO: On No Child Left Behind, Santorum said he had made a mistake. (SOUNDBITE OF DEBATE) SHAPIRO: Throughout the debate, Romney had a wing man in Texas Congressman Ron Paul, who kept up his own line of fire against Santorum. Moderator John King of CNN asked Paul about an attack ad that labels Santorum a fake. (SOUNDBITE OF DEBATE) (SOUNDBITE OF LAUGHTER) SHAPIRO: While the audience roared, Santorum held out his arm and said: I'm real, Ron, I'm real. Congressman Paul replied: Congratulations. (SOUNDBITE OF DEBATE) SHAPIRO: Over a score of debates, stretching back to last May, Santorum has never before been the target of the crossfire, but after he won three events on February 7th, all that changed. Last night it seemed as though everyone else had been saving up their ammunition for this moment. And Santorum was at times awkward in responding. When Romney accused him of supporting earmarks in the Senate, Santorum said there are good earmarks and bad ones. (SOUNDBITE OF DEBATE) SHAPIRO: Former House Speaker Newt Gingrich jumped in to back up Santorum -noting that Romney sought out earmarks for the Winter Olympics in Utah. (SOUNDBITE OF DEBATE) SHAPIRO: Gingrich did not seem especially happy to be relegated to the role of backup singer. But if he was trying to unseat Santorum as the more conservative alternative, Gingrich never quite seized the moment. On one issue after another, Romney and Santorum fought through clenched smiles. They even clashed over issues on which they agree, such as federal aid to car companies. Both men oppose it. But Santorum says Romney's position on bailouts is not consistent enough. (SOUNDBITE OF DEBATE) (SOUNDBITE OF CHEERING) SHAPIRO: Just outside the hall, hundreds of people watched on an outdoor screen in a balmy evening. When the debate ended, the street party continued with music booming out over the speaker system. It will be weeks before we know whether there will be any more post-debate parties until the fall.

Everything about Tuesday's campaign event in southeast Michigan's Shelby  Township highlighted that Mitt Romney is a local product running for president. Songs from Motown and Bob Seger blared. A giant deep-blue Michigan state flag hung stage right. An aide passed out paczki (pronounced \"punchkey\"), jelly-filled Polish pastries that are a Fat Tuesday tradition in Michigan. Then came the candidate. \"Michigan has gone through a one-state recession and now a national recession,\" Romney told the audience. \"I'm glad to see Michigan coming back \u2014 and it is coming back \u2014 but no thanks to this president. Everything he has done is making this economy harder to reboot.\" Michigan holds its primary next week. Polls show a tight race between native son Romney and former Pennsylvania Sen. Rick Santorum. Romney is playing up his business experience and his personal ties to the state, where his father was a well-liked governor. Santorum's message is blue-collar conservatism aimed at Tea Party and evangelical voters. He made campaign stops on the other side of Michigan on Monday. Social Issues Take Center Stage In a state where the jobless rate is 9.3 percent, Romney kept the focus of his speech on the economy. He only briefly touched on his opposition to the federal bailout that helped General Motors and Chrysler three years ago. He argued again that the car companies could have survived by going through bankruptcy without the federal help. Audience reaction seemed mixed on that point, but there were big cheers for Romney's criticism of White House economic policies. When it was the audience's turn to talk, their questions were just as likely to be about social issues, though, as the first one was \u2014 a query about what a President Romney would do \"to protect our religious freedom.\" Romney alluded to his own Mormon faith in an answer that was critical of the White House, accusing the president of fighting against religion. \"I can assure you, as someone who has personally understood the significance of religious tolerance, the right to one's own conscience ... we will never again attack religious liberty in the United   States of America if I'm president.\" Social issues were even more prominent at events Santorum held on the other side of the state Monday. \"It's great to be in west Michigan, where the family conservative values are the strongest of any place in the country,\" he told supporters. During a stop at Hope  College, a Christian school, Santorum talked at length about the conflict between President Obama and Catholic bishops over contraceptives and health care coverage. And he said the president is attacking the Catholic church. \"It is not just an assault on that church, but an assault on every religion in America,\" he said. \"This happens in China, not America.\" Taking Aim At Obama Santorum also took brief jabs at Romney, calling him inconsistent on issues important to real conservatives. But mostly he went after President Obama on issue after issue, including global warming. \"We need someone who's been out there consistently opposing this supposed climate science of man-made global warming, which it turns out, as we've all studied it, it wasn't climate science ... it was political science,\" Santorum said. Santorum recognizes that to win this state, he has to do very well outside of southeast Michigan, which is a Romney stronghold. And Santorum will need a big turnout from Christian conservatives and Tea Party members. At the same time, he has to continue introducing himself to voters. On that front, he's won over Mark Moore in Muskegon. \"To be honest, I was a Newt supporter,\" said the 47-year-old Moore. \"The reason I didn't, at first, like Santorum is because I thought he was a quiet Mr. Nice Guy.\" Now, Moore said, Santorum has convinced him otherwise.",

Now that Congress has passed the extension of the payroll tax cut and jobless insurance benefits for the long-term uninsured, as well as a fix that prevents cuts in Medicare reimbursements to doctors, there's the sense that not much else will get done on Capitol Hill, it being a general-election year and all. And that sense, captured in a recent Politico article, may be true in so far as major legislation goes. In  Washington's superpolarized political atmosphere, it's hard enough to get such bills passed in a year when the White House isn't up for grabs, let alone a year like 2012 when it is. But whether a Congress can be defined as do-something or do-nothing is really in the eye of the beholder. If you judge Congress by its ability to pass landmark legislation or bills that address the real needs of the U.S. population, then you likely won't be giving Congress over the next year high marks for accomplishing much. But if you judge Congress by the standard of whether lawmakers make numerous symbolic statements with their legislative maneuvering, then you're likely to view the coming months as very productive indeed. James Thurber, an American University professor and director of the school's Center for Congressional and Presidential Studies, is in the first camp, defining an effective Congress as one that produces \"outcomes that solve problems.\" By that standard, he doesn't have high hopes for the rest of the year. \"There'll be a lot of wedge issues and agony and angst,\" said Thurber. \"There'll be lots of oversight that will go a long way to try and point out what the parties believe in, instead of legislation that's likely to pass.\" For instance, you'll probably see quite a few more sessions like Thursday's humdinger of a hearing by the House Oversight and Investigations Committee focusing on the question of whether the Obama administration's new birth-control rule threatens religious freedom. Not surprisingly, Republicans stacked the deck, as is the majority's prerogative, with witnesses who agreed that the regulation is such a threat, while some Democrats walked out of the hearing because the first panel had no women on it. Even with it being an election year, it would seem that Congress has some \"musts\" on its to-do list. For instance, deep cuts in the defense budget are scheduled to start taking effect in 2013 and beyond if Congress does nothing to head them off. Norm Ornstein, of the American Enterprise Institute, an expert on Congress, isn't so sure that even that sword of Damocles is enough to get Republicans and Democrats to agree on averting cuts. \"There's not much incentive of Democrats to negotiate if there's no broader deal that includes revenue (or new tax increases). And given how on the Republican side, the politics are driven by the presidential race, any deal that included higher revenues would be greeted with blowback from the Republican base.\" Also, Ornstein added, the just approved payroll tax cut agreement is a fly in the ointment going forward for GOP leaders. Many rank-and-file House Republicans and some in the Senate were unhappy with it because they didn't want to extend the cut in the first place and certainly didn't want to do so without offsetting it with spending cuts. \"Overall, the deal was seen as caving,\" Ornstein said, which means when it comes to future negotiations that might include some form of higher taxes, Republican leaders aren't \"going to have the troops behind them.\" So it could very well shape up to be a do-nothing Congress in terms of legislative achievement from here on out, though as Ornstein reminds us, circumstances often have a way of making Congress act. \"The world may force Congress to do something because of economic circumstances or foreign policy,\" he said. If Congress essentially runs the clock out the rest of the year, that wouldn't necessarily make everyone unhappy. Hundreds of Washington lobbyists spend their working hours trying to make sure that the federal policies that benefit their clients stay exactly the way they are. \"The big winner on the Hill is the status quo,\" Thurber said. \"It's great to lobby for the status quo because you usually win and you get paid a lot of money for it.\"",

Foster Friess, Rick Santorum's billionaire supporter, drew some attention from his candidate Thursday with a comment about contraception that was, to say the least, unusual and surefire fodder for late-night TV comedians . MSNBC host Andrea Mitchell asked Friess about the Republican presidential candidate's very conservative views on social issues and whether he had any worries that they could be disadvantageous to Santorum in the general election. Visit msnbc.com for breaking news, world news, and news about the economy Friess not only didn't think so; he indicated he didn't see what all the fuss was about. And then he dispensed some advice about contraceptives: MITCHELL: Do you have any concerns about some of his comments on social issues, contraception, about women in combat, and whether that would hurt his general election campaign would he be the nominee? FRIESS: I get such a chuckle when these things come out. Here we have millions of our fellow Americans unemployed; we have jihadist camps being set up in Latin America, which Rick has been warning about; and people seem to be so preoccupied with sex. I think it says something about our culture. We maybe need a massive therapy session so we can concentrate on what the real issues are. And this contraceptive thing, my gosh, it's [so] inexpensive. Back in my day, they used Bayer aspirin for contraceptives. The gals put it between their knees and it wasn't that costly. MITCHELL: Excuse me, I'm just trying to catch my breath from that, Mr. Friess, frankly. So according to Friess, before the pill there was another pill. Many of us consider aspirin a miracle drug, but this use was news to many of us who came of age in a later era than the 71-year-old Friess. It's not often that you see Mitchell thrown for a loop by an interviewee's answer. Friess pretty much ensured that on a day when Santorum would rather be talking about his plans for revitalizing U.S. manufacturing, he would instead be asked, and probably more than once, about Friess as well as the curious uses to which aspirin has been put. Another obvious point: Anyone who thinks aspirin held between a woman's knees is an effective contraceptive or even a good abstinence joke definitely wouldn't get all the hubbub over reproductive rights.",

Rick Santorum released four years' worth of tax returns Wednesday evening which showed that he is wealthy by any measure. But his returns may also allow his critics, both those aligned with Mitt Romney, his chief rival for the Republican presidential nomination and those who aren't, to attack the former U.S. senator from Pennsylvania for not giving as much to charity as many others at his income level. An excerpt from Politico, which first reported on the tax returns: \"Santorum and his wife Karen filed joint returns for all four years. As you'll see from the returns, the Santorums' adjusted gross income went from about $659,000 in 2007, his first year out of the Senate, to $952,000 in 2008, to $1.1 million in 2009 and about $923,000 in 2010. \"They paid about $167,000 in taxes in 2007, about $262,000 in 2008, $310,000 in 2009, and $263,000 in 2010. \"There is depreciation on a condo property over the various years. The Santorums' charitable giving was a small percentage of his income each year.\" The Santorums actually gave less than two percent of their income to charity, a smaller percentage than the average for people in their income group though not extremely so. The average is slightly more than three percent. It's much less than the 16 percent the Romney and his wife Anne donated to charity, however. That could present something of an opening for Santorum's critics to accuse him of talking the talk but not walking the walk when it comes to faith and social values. Many devout people of faith tithe, giving at least 10 percent of their income to their church. The emerging criticism was apparent in a post by Jennifer Rubin, a conservative blogger at the Washington Post. \"... In those four years he gave a shockingly tiny amount to charity. In no year was charitable giving more than 3 percent of his income, and he dipped below 2 percent in one year. \"He apparently believes in church doctrine about contraception but not about tithing.\" Similar criticisms could be seen in the comments section of the Politico story.",

That was certainly the case in 1980, when Ronald Reagan ousted Jimmy Carter; in 1992, when Bill Clinton toppled the senior George Bush; and in 2008, in the midst of an economic crisis and financial meltdown, when Barack Obama won the White House.  And it's likely to be the deciding factor as to whether Obama gets reelected. Social issues, such as abortion, have been a part of the campaign dialogue since at least the 1973 Roe decision. Reagan supporters talked about the sanctity of life and opposition to abortion in 1980 (top button); Gore supporters in 2000 argued that the election was about who would name Supreme Court justices to protect a woman's right to choose (bottom button).\n                \n                    \n                    Ken Rudin collection\n                    \n                \nhide caption But that's not to say that social issues won't play a significant role.  Issues like abortion and contraception were always going to come up in the campaign, we knew that.  And for some voters, perhaps more so on the GOP side, the passion over such issues may very well surpass their feelings for the candidates. Republicans will argue, as they have been for years now, over Mitt Romney's true views on abortion.  Many debate whether his opposition is based on core principles or expediency, and that debate is likely to continue.  It's a debate that can only help the Democrats in November, should Romney become the nominee.  But social conservatives in general, and the nation's Roman Catholic bishops in particular, have directed their fury in recent days on the Obama administration's decision, since revised, to require religious organizations and charities to pay for insurance plans that offer free birth control.  It's a policy that, while hardly radical, contradicts Catholic teachings about contraception.  And it's a controversy the White House would rather not have entered. The outcry came not only from Republicans and their religious allies but from many Democrats as well.  Former Virginia Gov. Tim Kaine, the party's likely nominee for the Senate this year who is Catholic, said he had \"grave concerns\" about the White House's policy, and Sens. Bob Casey (Pa.) and Joe Manchin (W.Va.), who are both up for re-election this year, also expressed their opposition.   The compromise announced Friday shifted the responsibility of paying for the contraceptives from the religious charities to health insurance companies.  But even those normally aligned with Obama were not completely satisfied. Still, one can't help but think that in the end, this is less about contraception and religious teachings and more about what some inside the GOP see as a winning issue, one that paints Obama as hostile to religion and religious freedom.  It also once again draws attention to the fact that the White House once again found itself the need to backtrack on a controversy it created, whether or not the original policy was the correct one.  As we've learned these past three years, whenever it backtracks, it satisfies no one. One unanswered question is whether Catholics, who don't normally vote as a bloc, will see this as an issue to get excited about. Although Catholic teaching prohibits contraception, surveys show that an overwhelming number of Catholic women have used birth control at some point in their lives.  But that may not really be the point, according to opponents.  They ask, should the Obama administration be offering edicts that violate or contradict official religious teachings? And it's not just birth control that has reminded us of a resumption of the culture wars.  Lately, it's been non stop.  There was the abortion-related flap about the Susan G. Komen foundation and its decision to cut funding to Planned Parenthood \u2014 a decision since reversed following unrelenting outside pressure.  A federal appeals court panel overturned the California anti-gay marriage initiative known as Proposition 8 that was passed by the voters in 2008.  A federal judge decided not to block a Texas law that requires women to have a sonogram before having an abortion, a law that is designed to discourage abortions.  These are all things that may motivate voters one way or the other.  And, in selected swing states, they can influence the result in November. Yes, it's the economy, stupid, and Obama will undoubtedly rise or fall on it.  But don't discount the social issues. MittPAC: Mitt Romney won the straw poll on Saturday at CPAC, the Conservative Political Action Conference held in Washington, getting 38 percent of the vote.  Four years ago, Romney also won it; interestingly, he had ended his candidacy two days prior, also during the conference.  This year, Rick Santorum, off his sweep of three contests last Tuesday, finished second to Romney with 31 percent.  Newt Gingrich was well back with 15 percent and Ron Paul, who won the straw vote the past two years and often does well at these events, finished last with 12 percent.  The straw poll is always ballyhooed in the media but it has never been seen as a truly accurate portrayal of conservative sentiment, let alone a barometer of who eventually wins the nomination. Here's a recent history of CPAC straw poll winners: 2005:  Rudy Giuliani (2nd: Condoleezza Rice) 2006:  George Allen (2nd: John McCain) 2007:  Mitt Romney (2nd: Giuliani) 2008:  Romney (2nd: McCain) 2009:  Romney (2nd: Bobby Jindal) 2010:  Ron Paul (2nd: Romney) 2011:  Paul (2nd: Romney) Political Updates. I post periodic political updates during the week on Twitter. You can follow me at @kenrudin.  Meanwhile, time for some questions from the mailbag: Q:  A recent Political Junkie segment on TOTN discussed the well-trod thesis that \"Ron Paul's isolationism is way out of the mainstream.\"  I respect Ron Paul, though I'm not exactly a supporter. But I bristle every time I hear the idea that Paul's criticism of the USA's global military reach is \"nowhere near the mainstream\" (or one of its synonyms). It smacks of propaganda to me. I do think it's accurate to say that his criticism is a minority opinion, but minority opinions are nevertheless in the main stream of thought, even if they are not in its dominant current. \u2014 Eric Hughes, Salt Lake City, Utah A:  Point well taken. Q:  Will Ron Paul get to speak during the convention in prime time?  If he gets enough delegates, will he be able to influence the party platform, or will Romney dictate it?  And how will Paul's followers react if he's perceived as having been snubbed? \u2014 Jim Bartos, Beaverton, Ore. A:  Four years ago, Paul, who was still an active candidate well after John McCain had sewn up the nomination, refused to attend the GOP convention in St. Paul and in fact held his own protest convention not far away in Minneapolis.  The rally was attended by some 10,000 Paul supporters.  This time he is expected to be more of a factor but, for the moment at least, he is the only one thus far not to have come in first in a primary or caucus.  So we don't know what his influence will ultimately be.  Still, his relationship with Romney is said to be cordial, and in fact he spends more of his time going after Newt Gingrich in the debates rather than Romney.  Perhaps Romney is hoping that a amicable relationship will help him win over Paul's supporters come the general election (assuming Romney is the nominee).  Should the relationship continue to be civil, there's no question that Romney will want Paul to speak at the convention in Tampa this summer.  Prime time I'm not sure. But one thing that you surely can say about most of those backing Paul is that they are totally committed to their candidate.  And so there's no guarantee that if Paul is not the nominee these voters will automatically go to Romney. Q:  Is the potential miscount we saw in the Iowa caucuses and the confusion later in Nevada going to make a difference to who gets the nomination? \u2014 Ray Betzner, Philadelphia, Pa. A:  For all the attention we place on the Iowa precinct caucuses, the fact is, the delegates to the national convention aren't awarded until the state convention, which occurs months later.  All that happens at the precinct caucuses is that delegates are elected and sent to the 99 county conventions.  There delegates are selected to the congressional district convention and then on to the state convention.  That's when the national delegates are selected.  Usually by then the nominee \u2014 certainly on the GOP side \u2014 has long since been decided. That's the case with caucuses in general.  National delegates aren't decided until the final tier of the process, which is usually a state convention.  I honestly don't know why there seems to be a new focus this year to remind people that delegates aren't awarded in the first round, when that's always been the case.  The real outcome of the caucuses, at least in their first tier, is headlines and momentum.  And that certainly does make a difference on the road to the national convention and the nomination. Q:  What is with New Hampshire claiming to be the first in the nation primary?  It should be Oregon.  One hundred years ago Oregon held the first primary, long before New Hampshire was even a colony, or something like that.  How long has this upstart New Hampshire primary been claiming to be the first in the nation? \u2014 Kent Coe, La Grande, Ore. A:  In the history of presidential preference primaries, you correctly note that Oregon came well before New Hampshire.  Back in 1912, on the Republican side, former President Theodore Roosevelt beat both Sen. Robert La Follette of Wisconsin, a fellow progressive, and President William Howard Taft in Oregon.  On the Democratic side, New Jersey Gov. Woodrow Wilson defeated House Speaker Champ Clark.  The state has been holding meaningful primaries ever since. And while Oregon was holding these presidential preference primaries, usually in May, New Hampshire was holding its contests early, in March.  But their primaries did not include the opportunity for voters to choose among candidates; the state usually sent unpledged delegates at large to the national conventions.  That didn't change until 1952, when candidates' names appeared on the ballot.  That year, President Truman was defeated in the Democratic primary by Sen. Estes Kefauver of Tennessee, and in the Republican contest, Dwight Eisenhower beat Sen. Robert Taft of Ohio.  Thus began New Hampshire's claim to the \"first in the nation\" primary, which continues to this day. But yes, Oregon began its presidential preference primary first. Q:  In your column about replacing Joe Biden for vice president with Hillary Clinton [see Nov. 7 Political Junkie], you asked why that story won't go away.  I'll tell you why.  Because a lot of us remember Biden's failure to investigate the Anita Hill-Clarence Thomas [harassment] issue; we remember Biden's saying that his committee didn't investigate because they didn't think Hill took it seriously.  At the time, I could have kicked Biden from California to Maine and back again.  I still could.  Biden came across then as all blow and no show.  His actions in the last few years have not changed that perception.  If Obama's running mate in 2012 were Hillary Rodham Clinton, I would be out working to get them elected.  With Biden as his running mate, I will vote. \u2014 Dorothy Mathews, Rural Hall, N.C. A:  You are far from the only person who would love to see Clinton replace Biden on the ticket this year.  She is among the nation's most popular politicians.  But as I wrote in November, Clinton says it's not going to happen, Biden says it's not going to happen, and Obama \u2014 who ultimately will make the decision \u2014 says it's not going to happen.  I agree. Q:  Your political knowledge amazes me, and I love listening to your  comments.  But I have a question about something you said in a recent podcast.  Do you really think Abraham Lincoln did not visit Alaska or Hawaii  when running for president because there was not quick and easy  transportation like airplanes then, and not because they  did not become states for almost another 100 years? \u2014 Scott Miller, Calif. A:  One of the problems I get into from time to time is that on radio it's not always obvious when I'm kidding or speaking with my tongue firmly imbedded in my cheek.  I certainly was kidding this time.  Oh, if you could only come watch Ron and me record the podcast.  You'd be stunned at some of the things we say that \u2014 thanks to the good sense of the folks who put the podcast together \u2014 never make it to air.

            "article_content": "West Virginia Sen. Joe Manchin, a Catholic up for re-election this year, was one of the Democrats who spoke out against the White House birth control policy before it was altered.\n                \n                    \n                    J.

Joe Manchin, a Catholic up for re-election this year, was one of the Democrats who spoke out against the White House birth control policy before it was altered. President Obama moved swiftly Friday to quell a politically perilous uproar involving two hot-button issues: birth control and religious institutions. In January, the Obama administration announced that under its health care law, religiously affiliated institutions such as hospitals and schools would have to include birth control in their employees' health coverage. All this week, Republicans on Capitol Hill bashed that policy as a violation of religious freedom, and some of the president's fellow Democrats added to the heat. 'An Accommodation' When the White House first announced its birth control coverage policy, it said it would wait 18 months before making a final ruling on the issue. But by Friday, it was clear that issue had turned into a political brush fire that could do a lot of damage if not doused quickly. So Obama stepped into the White House briefing room and announced what senior White House officials are calling \"an accommodation.\" Obama acknowledged everything was happening faster than planned. \"After the many genuine concerns that have been raised over the last few weeks, as well, frankly, the more cynical desire on the part of some to make this into a political football,\" he said, \"it became clear that spending months hammering out a solution was not going to be an option.\" Under the revised policy, religiously linked institutions will no longer have to directly provide birth control coverage. Instead, insurance companies themselves will have to offer such coverage free of charge. Is It About Religion Or Contraception? The timing of the president's policy shift suggested damage control. It came less than 48 hours after House Speaker John Boehner strode out onto the House floor and denounced the decision to mandate birth control coverage by religiously affiliated institutions. \"This attack by the federal government on religious freedom in our country must not stand and will not stand,\" Boehner said. The GOP offensive continued at the annual meeting in Washington of the Conservative Political Action Conference, or CPAC. Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell addressed that group on Thursday. \"The Obama administration has crossed a dangerous line, and we will fight this attack on the fundamental right to religious freedom until the courts overturn it or until we have a president who will reverse it,\" he said. Some of the fiercest criticism has come from Catholic Church leaders. Senate Republican leaders tapped New Hampshire freshman Sen. Kelly Ayotte, who happens to be Catholic, to state the gist of their argument. \"This is not a women's rights issue, this is a religious liberty issue,\" she said. That prompted a swift response from another Catholic lawmaker, Democratic Sen. Patty Murray of Washington state. \"Well, we have news for Republicans: This is about contraception,\" she said. Murray has nearly five years left in her term, unlike New York Senate Democrat Kirsten Gillibrand, who's seeking re-election this year. Still, like Murray, Gillibrand has been an enthusiastic supporter of the White House's original birth control mandate. \"I think the president made the right decision in ensuring that all America's women have access to affordable contraception,\" Gillibrand says. Democrats In Opposition Other Catholic senators facing voters next fall have been openly critical of the original policy. One of them is Democrat Bob Casey, whose state of Pennsylvania is home to many Catholic voters. \"I've said very clearly that I oppose the White House decision,\" Casey said Thursday. Another vulnerable Catholic Senate Democrat up for re-election this year is West Virginia's Joe Manchin. He, too, spoke out against the policy hours before it was altered. \"I feel it's wrong, the direction and the position that the administration is taking and [Health and Human Services] has taken. I think it needs to be repealed, overturned, and let's go back to where we were,\" he said. Some Democrats say privately they felt blindsided by the policy the White House has now altered. Wendy Schiller, associate professor of political science at Brown University, closely follows the Senate. She says this issue could affect which party controls the Senate next year. \"I mean, there's no question the Catholics remain a stalwart of the Democrats, particularly in some very key states and districts in the country,\" she says. \"So I think this was an issue that Democrats firmly believed had to be addressed as quickly as possible.\" The White House's shift in birth control policy was enough to quiet earlier criticism from Tim Kaine, a Catholic Democrat running for an open Senate seat in Virginia. \"My only concern was that a church or a church-affiliated institution not be required to do something or to purchase the coverage that violated religious doctrine,\" Kaine said on MSNBC after the president's announcement. \"That concern has been conclusively solved by this compromise.\" Republicans, however, are showing no signs of letting up on their criticism: GOP Sen. Roy Blunt of Missouri called Friday's policy shift \"an accounting gimmick.\"",

            "article_content": "After a week of reaping the political whirlwind stemming from its initial birth-control health-insurance rule, the Obama Administration was clearly in clean-up mode Friday with President Obama going before cameras in the White House press briefing room to announce the modified rule. The revision was a response to religious leaders, specifically Catholic bishops, who expressed outrage with the initial rule that mandated that religiously affiliated institutions like hospitals and universities provide workers, as part of their health-insurance coverage, contraceptives at no cost. With so much criticism coming not just from clerics and Republican political opponents, who attacked the policy as an assault on religious freedom, but even some of the administration's liberal allies, it was obvious Obama would need to find a compromise and quick. His key political strategist, David Axelrod, seemed to admit as much earlier in the week. The new policy will still mandate that women who work for such religiously affiliated institutions get their birth-control products with no out-of-pocket costs. The insurance companies instead of the institutions will pay. That accommodation isn't enough to still some critics, including the president's political opponents, who show no signs of giving any quarter on an issue he served up to them: Proving the point, Michael Steel, a spokesman for Speaker John Boehner issued the following statement: \"The Catholic  Church and others in our nation's religious community are not yet convinced the president's mandate doesn't constitute an attack on religious freedom, which has  been a fundamental American right for more than 200 years.  It's clear that  these organizations were not included in developing the so-called compromise  offered today. The president should take up the Bishops' offer to find a  resolution that respects all Americans' Constitutional rights.  In the meantime,  the House of Representatives, led by the House Energy and Commerce Committee,  will continue to work toward a legislative solution that achieves that same  goal.\" The revised policy was meant more to win back the president's progressive Catholic allies like senators Patrick Leahy of Vermont and Bob Casey of Pennsylvania; Tim Kaine of Virginia, the former governor, and columnist E.J. Dionne who had expressed unhappiness with the prior policy. Those policymakers were only a few of the representative faces of a large population of U.S. Catholics, especially in battleground states like Ohio, Pennsylvania, Wisconsin and Iowa who were incensed by the initial decision. The president had to thread a political needle, however. Even as he found a solution that would give his unhappy allies a reason to decrease their opposition, he also couldn't back away from his overarching commitment that women working for religiously affiliated institutions have the same access to birth control as those working for other employers. To retreat from that commitment would have revived the progressive criticism that the president has a tendency to fold to his conservative opposition. That's not the takeaway a president hoping to energize his base wants to leave hanging out there. Fortunately for the president, this dust-up happened early enough in the election year where it's likely to be overtaken by other events and, daresay, controversies. Obama also is fortunate in that he seems to have a sizable portion of the public on his side. According to a recent poll by the Public Religion Research Institute, 55 percent of Americans supported the idea of a mandate that employers provide women with birth control with no out-of-pocket costs to the employees while 52 percent of Catholics agreed with this. Of course, no one at this point can say exactly how this controversy will play out politically. As Beth Reinhard at the National Journal writes, it all has to do with which side wins the message spin war. If Republicans can make it all about religious liberty and the First Amendment, that could provide the GOP with an edge. On the other hand, women voters and young voters tend to skew Democratic and the issue of reproductive freedom is important to many of these voters. So if Democrats can persuade voters that religious liberty wasn't at risk but women's health and well-being was, that message could eventually win out. And let us not forget the bases of both parties. The controversy has given each party one more message it can use to stir enthusiasm to improve the turnout of its supporters come November.",

The news conference discussed the Obama administration's requiring employers to provide free contraceptive in their health coverage. Read Another Opinion On Birth Control Johnathan Cohn is a senior editor for The New Republic. Many pundits seem convinced the Obama Administration's decision on contraception coverage is bad politics for the president. And although I support the decision to make coverage mandatory, even for large religious institutions, that conclusion about the politics is likely true in at least one sense. Up until about a week ago, Obama was cruising politically. Unemployment was falling, the Republicans were self-destructing, and the president's poll numbers were climbing. The improvement was modest, for sure, but the trend seemed to be steady and in the right direction. Changing the subject was unlikely to help. And yet the subject has been changed, at least among the chattering class. Where I part with the other pundits is over the long-term effects of this controversy. They seem very sure of it. I am not. And since Nate Silver hasn't opined on how this might play out, let me attempt to do my best, admittedly imperfect, impersonation. As you probably know, the big danger for Obama is that this decision alienates Catholic voters. The idea is that these voters, who might otherwise see Obama as a defender of their economic interests, will turn against him: Even if they use contraception personally (as most do) and disagree with the Church's teaching, they'll interpret this decision as broadly hostile to religion and, perhaps, specifically hostile to Catholics. Whether Catholics will actually react in this way is the big question. And polls can't answer it that well, because even the most careful surveys I've seen don't differentiate clearly between people that might otherwise vote for Obama\u2014by, for example, differentiating between Catholics who attend church and those who don't, or between those with a college education and those without. Still, a widely cited poll from the Public Religion Research Institute offers some clues. Overall, slightly more than half of Catholic respondents to the survey said they supported requiring religious colleges and hospitals to provide contraception coverage, with zero cost. But Catholic voters opposed the idea, 52 percent to 48 percent, and white Catholic voters opposed the idea by 58 to 41 percent. (Why do we care about white Catholics? Because, presumably, non-white Catholics are strong Obama supporters.) A second, more subtle danger of politicizing this issue is that it fires up the Republican base. I know what you're thinking: Isn't the Republican base already pretty fired up about getting Obama out of office? Sure. But Mitt Romney remains the likely nominee and Republican voters don't seemed too fired up about him. Maybe, just maybe this episode helps convince them that Romney, who has attacked Obama stridently for the contraception rule, is their mana after all. And while the difference might seem incremental, every little bit matters in a close election. But intensity of feeling seems strong on both sides of this issue. And while the pundits spend all of their time talking about Catholic voters, there's another key demographic whose allegiance in the election is apparently up for grabs: Women who identify themselves as politically independent. I haven't seen a poll breaking out their opinions on the issue, but women overall support this decision by healthy margins. And in that sense they mirror the population as a whole, at least according to three of the four polls I've seen on the issue. In the PRRI poll, a majority of respondents to the PRRI survey said they supported making contraception coverage mandatory (55 percent to 40 percent) and a small plurality (49 percent to 46 percent) said they supported applying the mandate even to religious colleges and universities. This is despite the opposition of Catholic voters and strong opposition of evangelicals. The second poll comes from Lake  Research. It's a private poll, conducted on behalf of the Herdon Alliance last year, that Greg Sargent and Sam Stein have obtained. The third is a new poll from Public Policy Polling, on behalf of Planned Parenthood. In both of those surveys, majorities supported making birth control coverage mandatory and applying that requirement to religious institutions. The outlier is the fourth poll, from Rasmussen. In its survey from last year, only 39 percent of likely voters said they supported applying the requirement to religious organizations and 50 percent said they did not. Why the divergence? A likely explanation is the wording: Each survey posed the question in a slightly different way. We can debate which pollster was pushing in one direction or the other, for whatever reason. But, as I see it, the surveys actually support to the same conclusion: How this issue plays out depends on which side frames this controversy to its advantage. In short, if this controversy lingers, does it do so as a debate about religious liberty or access to contraception? Commentators and media coverage generally have focused on the former debate, in which the administration's critics seem to have greater political support. But voters may not see it that way, particularly given aggressive moves by the Conference of Catholic Bishops and some conservative Republicans to eliminate the contraception requirement altogether. (See my colleague Alec MacGillis' item yesterday for more on that.) Again, I really don't know how this will turn out. But I agree with Greg Sargent that \"leading commentators have been far too quick to declare this a certain political loser.\"",

According to a Pew study, Americans continue to get much of their election news from cable television.\n                \n                    \n                    Allison Joyce/Getty Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption Supporters watch primary results in Manchester, N.H., in January. According to a Pew study, Americans continue to get much of their election news from cable television. The twists and turns of the Republican presidential campaign have been practically made for \u2014 and watched on \u2014 live television. And despite predictions of new media tools like Twitter and Facebook dominating election coverage, Americans are continuing to rely on an old standby: cable TV. After coming in second in the Nevada caucuses, Newt Gingrich assured reporters that national news exposure would be a surefire remedy for catching up with Mitt Romney. \"I actually think we're a national system in terms of information flow. So I think if I'm on [Fox News'] Hannity, or if I happen to be in The Associated Press ... or if I'm  one of the networks or even in the New York Times, that in fact it reaches the whole country,\" Gingrich said. Indeed, a survey of more than 1,500 people by the Pew  Research Center shows that more than one-third of Americans are leaning on cable channels for election news \u2014 just as many as in past years \u2014 while relying less on local television stations, newspapers and the national networks. Social media has been much heralded but relatively little used by average voters. Andrew Kohut, president, Pew Research Center And the new media kids on the block? The media may be fixated on them, says Andrew Kohut, president of the Pew  Research Center, but the public is not. \"Social media has been much heralded but relatively little used by average voters and average citizens,\" he says. According to the Pew study, only 2 percent of people sought election news from Twitter, 3 percent from YouTube and 6 percent from Facebook. \"These numbers are very modest given all that we've heard about the impact of social networks on this campaign,\" Kohut says. General voter interest is down from 2008, in no small part because only  one  party has a competitive race this time. As younger voters skew  Democratic, that  may also have dampened the relative reliance on  emerging social media platforms  by those voters who are engaged. Cable  news audiences are, on average, a lot  older \u2014 in their late 50s and  60s, according to past estimates from Nielsen  Media Research. Obama campaign officials say their social media strategy is to mobilize   supporters, engage donors and inspire backers to get the message out  to other  voters. In other words, it's narrowcasting. Even in the age  of the right/left  split of cable with Fox News and MSNBC, television  news channels reach a lot of  people who don't back a specific candidate  and are looking for more  information. Digital media professionals argue that traditional measures like the Pew study are missing the point. Amy Webb, CEO of the Webbmedia Group, says social media users are providing a growing body of information about voter preferences. \"What do women who shop at a grocery store on Sunday afternoons instead of Saturday mornings \u2014 who also happen to be executives and live in Chicago \u2014 think?\" Webb says. \"We can get really, really targeted now. And as crazy as all of this may seem, we are the ones providing all of this data.\" Media critic William Powers recently joined the Boston-based digital media company Bluefin Labs to help assess the political conversations unfolding online. The 2012 campaign may not be decided by social media, Powers says, but those tools offer a wealth of information about the national mood. \"American presidential campaigns still occur largely on television \u2014 on the old medium,\" Powers says. \"That's where the narrative takes place. And all this explosion on Twitter is largely people reacting to televised events.\"  Powers says Bluefin, founded by an MIT linguistics professor, is using a sophisticated algorithm to gauge how people react to political rhetoric by sorting through tweets in real time.  \"We're in a position to make sense of the context,\" Powers says. \"The context is debates and ads, and all these TV events that are going to make up much of the campaign. And Twitter is where the public is talking back to the TV.\" Powers calls Twitter a focus group in the wild \u2014 hundreds of thousands of tweets, offering raw responses to each debate or speech, as seen on cable TV. It is a layered conception of old and new media coexisting \u2014 like modern apartment buildings standing amid the ancient ruins in Rome.",

Rick Santorum speaks to supporters, flanked by his daughter, Elizabeth (left), and wife, Karen. Pity the poor news junkie, waiting bleary-eyed at the witching hour, wondering how to feel about the latest events in the Republican nominating contest. One news source \u2014 let's say it's a cable news operation \u2014 says the latest round of GOP presidential preference contests is a huge boost to the flagging fortunes of Rick Santorum, the winner of the night's trifecta.  The cable outlets all air tape of Santorum's triumphant victory speech again and again.  He surely looks like a winner. full results And what a great made-for-TV story it is, too.  A neck-snapping turnaround for the former senator from Pennsylvania, who had peaked in Iowa five weeks ago and promptly disappeared.  Lacking money and organization, he finished out of the money in New Hampshire, South Carolina, Florida and Nevada. Now he roars back and wins big in Missouri and Minnesota, two middle-sized states that might claim to speak for the mainstream of the Midwest.  Even more impressive is his narrower win in Colorado, a Western state Mitt Romney had won in 2008. But wait! Some other news sources \u2014 not locked in the life-and-death struggle of cable news \u2014 say it was all meaningless.  No delegates were chosen or committed or bound (or whatever it is they do with delegates at this stage of the game). How can that be?  It's one thing to be told at midnight that a race is too close to call.  That's suspenseful, and suspense is good for keeping us all up and watching.  But it's another thing entirely to be told a race, however close, is essentially meaningless.  Who wants that? And more to the point, who's right about this? Well, both sides can claim some facts for their case.  Santorum clearly dominated the results in Missouri, beating runner-up Romney by 30 percentage points in the \"beauty contest\" primary there.  Delegates will actually be chosen by another process in mid-March, but never mind.  This was clearly Santorum's night, and he might just do well in the delegate selection, too. In Minnesota, Santorum was the guy for 45 percent of those who turned out for caucuses.  He walloped second-place finisher Ron Paul by 18 percentage points.  Supposed national front-runner Romney was a weak third with just 17 percent.  Newt Gingrich, supposedly the main challenger to national front-runner Romney, got just about 11 percent. Most surprising of all, Santorum built an early lead in the rural counties of Colorado and survived a Romney surge from the urban areas to prevail with just under 40 percent.  Gingrich and Paul trailed with barely a dozen points each. All that seems pretty obvious and pretty simple.  Big, big night for Santorum.  So, the kid stays in the picture. In fact, if you were watching CNN, you got the impression you should be ordering your tickets for his inauguration. OK. Take a breath. Now let's take another look at those facts. Not only was the Missouri vote a \"beauty contest,\" binding no delegates, but the turnout there was less than 6 percent of the voting-age population \u2014  a paltry number for a statewide primary.  Moreover, Missouri's results were a bit askew because Gingrich did not get on the ballot. In Minnesota, a state of about the same population, the party caucuses drew just over 50,000 participants (about a fifth as many as in Missouri).  That was a little over 1 percent of the voting-age population.  Again, no commitment of delegates. In Colorado, again a state of roughly 5 million people, about 65,000 turned out, but that was still well below 2 percent of the voting-age population.  Delegate haul?  Well, zero for now. That's not much of a plebiscite.  And it could be a poor indicator of the sentiment of most Republicans and independents.  What it measures instead is the ardor of that fraction of the GOP vote that is willing to turn out for a nighttime caucus where no delegates are actually being decided. Sharp-eyed news consumers will be quick to note that the national opinion polls rarely have more than a thousand respondents or so.  The really good ones may push out to 1,500 interviews. So why is 50,000 or 65,000 somehow a lousy sample? Simple answer:  Because that sample may be anything but representative of the rest of state. The science behind polling is that the phone calls go out via random digit dialing.  In theory, anyone with a phone might be called.  And pollsters have gotten much better about including cellphones in their work. In a caucus, however, like the ones in Minnesota, the people who show up are predominantly the people most passionately committed to a candidate or an issue.  In Minnesota GOP caucuses, that issue is usually abortion.  So this week's caucus told us less about Minnesotans' preference among candidates and more about the feelings of the anti-abortion movement. Lacking exit or entrance polls, we cannot say for certain what issues drove the vote to Santorum this week.  But it has never been a secret that Santorum was the candidate most devoted to the anti-abortion cause.  He is, in some respects, its secular patron saint. Moreover, anyone doubting the persistent potency of the abortion issue in national politics need only consider the big news stories of the past week.  The few days of February to date have brought not one but two significant controversies over abortion. One began when the Susan G. Komen charity that fights breast cancer decided to cut off funding to Planned Parenthood, which includes abortion among its services.  Within days, Komen had backtracked, and its anti-abortion vice president had resigned. The other abortion-related dust-up threatens to last much longer. It was raised when Catholic bishops and other religious authorities objected to a rule in the new federal health care law requiring religious organizations that hire people outside their faith to offer those employees health insurance plans that cover contraception, including the so-called morning-after pill. The Komen issue briefly energized the pro-abortion rights forces.  The birth-control insurance mandate on religious institutions will do the same for anti-abortion activists in the weeks and months ahead. And for the moment, at least, that movement has another cause and a new hero in Rick Santorum.  Take him seriously now, because he will be around for a while.  Just don't expect to see the party nominate him in Tampa.",

Republican presidential hopeful Mitt Romney has joined the chorus criticizing President Obama over a controversial policy that would require most employers, including Catholic hospitals and universities, to include birth control in their employees' health insurance. Catholic opinion leaders have denounced the policy as an assault on their religious freedom. Ever since priests first took to their pulpits more than a week ago to attack the new birth control mandate, the administration has been feeling heat from all sides. On Tuesday, White House spokesman Jay Carney said the administration was open to exploring changes to \"allay some of these concerns.\" On the Republican campaign trail this week, Romney gleefully picked up the refrain that the White House is trying to dictate to religious institutions. \"We must have a president who is willing to protect America's first right \u2014 a right to worship God according to the dictates of our own conscience,\" he said. The Obama administration insists it's sensitive to religious liberty, and churches themselves are exempt from the requirement. But Carney says the administration is also trying to protect another interest: women's access to affordable birth control, even if they happen to work at a Catholic hospital or university. \"We believe that these services are important, and that American women deserve to have access to that kind of insurance coverage, regardless of where they work,\" he said Monday. A survey released Tuesday by Public Policy Polling on behalf of Planned Parenthood suggests most voters agree, including 53 percent of Catholic voters and 63 percent of women. \"These are obviously groups that are going to be really key for the election this fall \u2014 swing voter groups. And they're all quite supportive of the birth control benefit,\" said Tom Jensen, who directed the survey. Framing The Debate Political scientist John Green of the University of Akron suspects church leaders will win this argument if they succeed in framing the issue as one of religious autonomy, rather than women's access. \"A lot of people who would be perfectly content to have these kinds of services in their personal health care package might be concerned about the impact on the institutional church,\" he said. So supporters of the new policy are belatedly trying to refocus attention in a more popular direction, away from religious freedom and toward women's health care. Lanae Erickson of the centrist Democratic think tank Third Way says that argument is especially persuasive with the independent voters who helped elect Barack Obama three years ago. There are ways to resolve this issue that ensures we provide that important preventive service to all women ... in a way that also tries to allay some of these concerns. White House spokesman Jay Carney \"Obama independents were much more secular than independents generally and much more secular than Americans generally. They were more female and they were much more moderate,\" Erickson said. That's not to say the new policy hasn't alienated some of Obama's ardent Catholic supporters.  But most white Catholics who attend Mass weekly didn't vote for him last time anyway. While the president and his allies prefer to talk about birth control more than religious liberty, Romney is just the opposite. When birth control came up during an ABC debate last month, the former Massachusetts governor quickly tried to change the subject. \"Contraception? It's working just fine.  Just leave it alone,\" Romney joked when questioned by ABC debate moderator George Stephanopoulos. In fact, Romney, along with House Republicans, wants to eliminate government funding for birth control. Jensen says that puts the GOP front-runner out of step with most Americans. \"He's sort of playing with fire here,\" Jensen said. \"This is definitely an issue that has the potential to be pretty resonant this fall and it's one where congressional Republicans and Mitt Romney really may pay a price at the polls if they try to take this benefit away.\" Attempt Toward Compromise Religious institutions, meanwhile, have another year-and-a-half before the birth control mandate takes effect. White House spokesman Carney signals there's still time for a compromise. \"There are ways to resolve this issue that ensures we provide that important preventive service to all women ... in a way that also tries to allay some of these concerns,\" he said. But crafting a policy to satisfy diverse constituencies and congregations no longer seems a top priority. Both sides are increasingly preaching to their own choirs.",

            "article_content": "The Obama administration's controversial decision to require religiously affiliated  institutions like universities and medical centers to provide workers with health insurance that covers prescription birth control without a co-pay appears to have support from a majority of voters, according to a new poll by Public Policy Polling. The poll, done on behalf of Planned Parenthood, also suggested that Mitt Romney, frontrunner for the Republican presidential nomination, could pay a price at the polls for taking the position that he would reverse the recent decision by the Health and Human Services Department. Romney, like Catholic bishops, has argued that the decision is counter to First Amendment religious freedoms. The PPP poll found that 56 percent of all those polled supported the administration's decision while 37 percent opposed it. The poll had a margin of error of 5-1/2 percent. Voters who described themselves as independents showed a similar split. Even a majority of Catholics appeared to support the Obama administration decision though by a narrower margin, 53 percent to 45 percent. One of the most interesting findings was the response of Catholics to the  question of whether they would be more or less inclined to support the GOP presidential candidate in November because of his position on the issue. Forty six percent of Catholics said they would be less likely to support Romney versus 28 percent who said they would be more likely and 23 percent said it would make no difference. Among all voters, 40 percent it would make them less likely to support the former Massachusetts governor versus 23 percent who said more and 33 percent who said it wouldn't matter. \"It really has the potential to hurt him with some of these key groups that could go either way, independents, Catholics, this fall,\" said Tom Jensen, PPP's director. \"It doesn't really square with the image Romney might want to project in the general election as sort of being a moderate on social issues. So he's sort of playing with fire here.\"",

At a rally in the gym at Arapahoe High School in Centennial, Colo., Monday night, Romney rolled out some new material: the rights given to people by God. \"I am just distressed as I watch, as I watch our president try and infringe upon those rights,\" Romney said to the capacity crowd. \"The first amendment of the Constitution provides the right to worship in the way of our own choice.\" Romney cited a Supreme Court case related to the firing of a teacher at a religious school, and a recent decision by the department of Health and Human Services to require religious institutions like schools and hospitals to cover birth control pills as part of the insurance provided to employees. That includes \"contraceptives, morning-after pills \u2014 in other words, abortive pills,\" Romney said, venturing into territory he typically doesn't address on the campaign trail. \"Think what that does to people in faiths that do not share those views. This is a violation of conscience.  We must have a president who is willing to protect America's first right \u2014 a right to worship God according to the dictates of our own conscience,\" Romney said. The crowd cheered wildly, one of several times over the course of what was otherwise a variation on his standard stump speech. The new language seemed targeted directly at social conservatives \u2014 voters who have tended to favor Rick Santorum and at times Newt Gingrich. On the same day, the Romney campaign went after Santorum in a conference call, questioning his conservative credentials. In that call, Romney surrogate and former Minnesota Gov. Tim Pawlenty admitted that the campaign considers Santorum a threat. \"He's a credible candidate and deserves to be, you know, right in the middle of the back-and-forth between campaigns, and I think that's what you see happen,\" Pawlenty said. Recent polling shows Santorum in the lead in the nonbinding Minnesota caucuses, with Romney still a favorite in Colorado's caucuses.

Participating in the event were Newt Gingrich, Rick Santorum, Ron Paul, and Rick Perry. Front-runner Mitt Romney did not attend. South Carolina holds its primary on Saturday.  RENEE MONTAGNE, HOST: And four of the candidates appeared last night at a Greenville, South Carolina forum sponsored by an anti-abortion group. Personhood USA wants to set new legal definitions for when life begins, and the group held its forum in a state with many evangelical Christians who have strong views on abortion. NPR's Don Gonyea was there. DON GONYEA, BYLINE: Abortion has not been a dominant topic in this year's contest in South Carolina largely because the state has a jobless rate of nearly 10 percent. Still, all of the GOP hopefuls call themselves pro-life, and all but Mitt Romney joined in last night's Personhood forum. Romney's credibility on the issue is often questioned because he was pro-choice earlier in his career. His absence last night was noted several times, including right at the top by Personhood USA President Keith Mason. KEITH MASON: We didn't know until last night, but I did get a phone call from one of his state representatives saying that there was a conflict and, you know, he was not able to make it. GONYEA: Mason then noted that Romney also had a conflict and didn't attend a similar forum in Iowa. He said another will be held in advance of the upcoming Florida primary and that he hopes Romney can make that one. Personhood USA was behind an unsuccessful ballot initiative in Mississippi last year. That effort, to define life at the fertilization of an egg and not the implantation of that fertilized egg in the uterus, failed. Even some in the right to life movement worried that it was unwise politically that it would be struck down by courts while stirring up the opposition in the process. Last night's participants were Rick Perry, Newt Gingrich, Rick Santorum and Ron Paul, who joined from D.C. via satellite. Governor Perry went first, and here was the first question. UNIDENTIFIED MAN: When are we a person with rights, under the law? GOVERNOR RICK PERRY: I would suggest to you it starts at conception. GONYEA: The moderator pressed him, asking what he meant by conception. UNIDENTIFIED MAN: Conception being defined as... PERRY: When the sperm and the egg come together and pretty much - you got a different idea? (SOUNDBITE OF LAUGHTER) GONYEA: Next, Newt Gingrich - same question, though his answer was less playful than Perry's. NEWT GINGRICH: We are fully human upon conception because all of the genetic patterns needed are in existence at that moment, and therefore the right should attach at that moment. GONYEA: Gingrich also singled out an organization that is public enemy number one for many anti-abortion activists. GINGRICH: We will defund Planned Parenthood sometime early in 2013. GONYEA: Next up, Rick Santorum. RICK SANTORUM: I think we give up too much, and others have in this campaign, by saying they believe life begins at conception. I don't think believe life begins at conception; I know life begins at conception and... (SOUNDBITE OF APPLAUSE) GONYEA: The final speaker was Ron Paul, who was in line with the other candidates on when life begins. But he also suggested that the real solution is not necessarily a legal one. REPRESENTATIVE RON PAUL: And the laws so often reflect the people's culture, but we cannot change the people's morality by writing more laws. We can write more and more laws, but eventually we have to change the hearts and the minds of the people. We need stronger families and we need more respect for life than the laws will respect. UNIDENTIFIED MAN: Thank you, Representative Paul, thank you. Thank you for talking to us. (SOUNDBITE OF APPLAUSE) GONYEA: When it was over, the audience filed out, having seen an entire evening devoted to a topic that is, for many of them, still the issue in this and every election.

            "article_content": "The latest abortion battle doesn't pit people on opposite sides of the issue against each other. Rather, it features two of the leading GOP candidates for president, each charging that the other is less than pure as the race heads to socially conservative South   Carolina. Both former House Speaker Newt Gingrich and former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney (well, a \"superPAC\" run by former Romney aides) now have ads attacking each other's abortion failings. The anti-Gingrich ad, sponsored by the group Restore Our Future, notes that \"as speaker, Gingrich even supported taxpayer funding of some abortions.\" And the ad the Gingrich campaign is now running against Romney takes aim at some of the latter's actions while he was governor. \"Romney appointed a pro-abortion judge,\" the ad says, \"expanded access to abortion pills, put Planned Parenthood on a state medical board, but failed to put a pro-life group on the same board. And Romney signed government-mandated health care with taxpayer-funded abortions.\" Listening to the ads, you might think the candidates support abortion rights. But that's hardly the case, says Donna Crane of NARAL Pro-Choice America. \"The idea that either of these candidates is in any way remotely pro-choice would be laughable, if it weren't actually so dangerous for women,\" she said. \"It really is preposterous.\" We asked three different anti-abortion groups for their view of the Republican ad wars, but they all declined to get involved in the intraparty dispute. Meanwhile, however, University of Pittsburgh law professor David Garrow says the main charge in the ad attacking Gingrich \u2014 that he supported taxpayer funding of some abortions \u2014 while \"it's not factually false, it's wholly inaccurate.\" Garrow says the problem is that the term \"some abortions\" is \"knowingly avoiding the fact that the measure that Gingrich supported, sponsored by well-known anti-abortion, right-to-life Congressman Henry Hyde, would have had the effect of removing financial support from 97, 98, 99 percent of abortions.\" Several other fact-checking organizations, including PolitiFact, have had similar complaints about the ad. Meanwhile, Gingrich's ad blasting Romney is more complicated, because Romney, when he was running for governor, claimed to support abortion rights. It was during his term that he said he had changed his mind on the subject. But even so, Romney can't be blamed \u2014 or take credit \u2014 for some of the things in the ad, says NARAL's Crane. For example, the charge about the Massachusetts health law providing taxpayer-funded abortions? Yes, the Massachusetts health program does pay for abortion, but so did the program it replaced. And that's largely because of a state Supreme Court ruling. \"So if the charge is does Massachusetts care for its low-income women, then, yes, guilty as charged,\" Crane said. \"Massachusetts has a good policy in that regard. But it's not attributable one way or another to Mitt Romney.\" The website Factcheck.org notes that the ad's reference to \"abortion pills\" is also misleading. It should, in fact, refer to the morning-after birth-control pill. And while Romney did sign one bill to make those pills more available, he also vetoed one that would have required their availability for rape victims. Still, in the end, Pittsburgh law professor and abortion scholar Garrow thinks the ad might actually help Romney, should he, as expected, become the GOP nominee. \"To the extent that Mitt Romney is being attacked as a moderate, such criticism, I think, may well insulate him, if not help him, in regards to what's coming down the pike in a few months' time, in terms of attacks from the Obama campaign that he's dangerously conservative, especially dangerous on something like abortion or the courts,\" Garrow said. So to the extent that Gingrich or other conservatives \"are attacking Romney as a dangerous moderate, they may well be serving him in very good stead for the long run.\" And that is, of course, exactly the opposite of what Romney's conservative opponents probably have in mind.",

            "article_content": "Many of the journalists and professional political types who dutifully watched Saturday night's Republican presidential debate in New Hampshire probably had the same thought occur to them at several points: \"For this we missed most of the NFL wildcard game between the New Orleans Saints and Detroit Lions?\" Not that there weren't fireworks. At one point when Rep. Ron Paul of Texas and Newt Gingrich traded barbs over the Texas congressman's description of the former speaker as a \"chicken hawk.\" It got so heated you half expected the ABC News moderators to tell them to take it outside. But the debate didn't really change the dynamics of the race and much of it was filled with the candidates repeating talking points we've all heard plenty of times before. So why couldn't we have just watched the football game instead? Anyway, since we watched it, we owe it to ourselves to figure out what happened, if anything? The biggest winner? Mitt Romney, the front-runner, without question. Romney probably came into the debate prepared to be savaged throughout much of the evening by his rivals as they tried to knock him down a few pegs. Instead, Gingrich and Rick Santorum attacked him early then quit. The former speaker hit him for actions as a private equity investor that led to worker layoffs. Santorum, the former senator from Pennsylvania, dismissed his CEO experience as not the right kind of leadership for the Oval Office. But they didn't follow through. It was left to Jon Huntsman Jr., the former Utah governor, to go after Romney for overly trash-talking China. But Huntsman has been doing this for months and it hasn't worked so why would it start now? Romney answered the questions he wanted to and ignored the rest, leaving the impression that he was in control, exactly what he was going for. Other winners? President Obama definitely won, too. Romney remained the only GOP candidate who seemed presidential. With his big money advantage and the full weight of the Republican establishment, Romney still appeared to be the eventual nominee. That meant all of the opposition research and strategizing the president's campaign has done for a year or more won't go to waste since Obama's campaign expected to be facing Romney in 2012. The biggest loser? Besides those of us who missed most of a good football game? It would have to be Texas Gov. Rick Perry. There were times when you could easily forget he was in the debate. And while he didn't have any gaffes, nothing he did argued for why he should still be in the race. He seemed the most irrelevant person on the stage. By definition, that would make him the biggest loser. Oh yeah, and he said he would send U.S. troops back into Iraq if he had the chance ensuring that voters, already disinclined to give it to him, will be even more so. Other losers? Santorum certainly fell in that category because he didn't build on his Iowa caucuses showing by making a sustained attack against Romney of the sort that might help him gain on the frontrunner in South Carolina. Throw Gingrich in the loser category too for not landing many blows on Romney. What's more, Gingrich resorted in his early attack on Romney to citing a New York Times story that chronicled the layoffs at an office-supplies company forced by Bain Capital when Romney headed that investment firm. A Republican presidential candidate leaning on The Times in a GOP debate to bash a rival might as well start quoting the president's criticisms of the same rival. It's not a winning strategy. Weirdest debate moment? Huntsman breaking out into Chinese again seemed off-putting. Whenever he does it, he always seems to be showing off. All of us who have paid attention know that he lived in China, that he was the U.S. ambassador there. We're glad the Berlitz lessons paid off. Let's move on. Most riveting moment? The aforementioned fight between Gingrich and Paul. As you might expect, Gingrich took a dim view of Paul essentially calling him a Vietnam-era draft dodger. Paul stood his ground. Most confusing moment for non constitutional lawyers? George Stephanopoulos' back and forth with Romney over whether states having the constitutional right to ban contraceptives. It was the old Abbott and Costello \"Who's on first?\" routine, only in a more high-brow form. As noted earlier, Saturday night's debate changed nothing. Romney did nothing to hurt himself and his rivals did precious little to damage him either. All I can say is, thank goodness Sunday's debate is early. It should be a fading memory by the time Sunday's wild card games start.",

Americans' religious liberties are under attack \u2014 or at least that's what some conservatives say. Newt Gingrich warns the U.S. is becoming a secular country, which would be a \"nightmare.\" Rick Santorum says there's a clash between \"man's laws and God's laws.\" And in a campaign ad, Rick Perry decried what he called \"Obama's war on religion,\" saying there is \"something wrong in this country when gays can serve openly in the military but our kids can't openly ... pray in school.\" Of course, children can pray in school, but Perry is echoing a larger argument: that religious freedom is at risk. The story is much more complicated than either side makes out. If you're looking for evidence that the Obama administration is hostile to faith, conservatives say, the new health care law is Exhibit A. The law requires employers to offer health care plans that cover contraceptives. Churches don't have to, but religiously affiliated charities, hospitals and colleges do. That doesn't sit well with the Catholic monks at Belmont Abbey College in North Carolina. \"When the government said to them, you're going to have to fund contraception, sterilization, in violation of your deeply held religious convictions, the monks at Belmont Abbey College knew that they just couldn't do that,\" says attorney Hannah Smith at the Becket Fund for Religious Liberty. The college sued in federal court last November. \"This is not just about health care,\" Smith says. \"This is really about government coercion of religious individuals and institutions.\" Religious conservatives see an escalating war with the Obama White House. One Catholic bishop called it \"the most secularist administration in history.\" Another bishop says it is an \"a-theocracy.\" Bishop William Lori of Bridgeport, Conn., who heads the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops' new Ad Hoc Committee on Religious Liberty, believes the First Amendment is clear: The government cannot make people choose between obeying the law and following their faith. I think [the Obama administration has] aggressively protected religious liberty in some issues and failed to protect it in other issues. But they're not hostile. Douglas Laycock, constitutional lawyer \"If the government can force a church's hand and force it to violate its cherished beliefs,\" he asks, \"then what's next?\" Because of that kind of force, Lori notes, Catholic Charities in Illinois shut down its adoption services rather than place children with same-sex couples, as the state required. The church also lost a federal contract to aid victims of human trafficking because the administration favored groups that provide contraceptive and abortion services. Lori admits no one has a right to federal money, but he says the government should accommodate religious beliefs. \"We don't have a constitutional right to a contract, but we do have a constitutional right not to be discriminated against because we're following our own convictions,\" he says. \"I am tired of hearing religious right organizations or the hierarchy of the Roman Catholic Church play the victim,\" says Rob Boston at Americans United for the Separation of Church and State. \"All we're really seeing right now is a very modest attempt from the Obama administration to put some controls on how some government money is spent when it flows to religious organizations,\" he says. \"It's a very reasonable thing that quite frankly should have happened a long time ago.\" Douglas Laycock, a constitutional lawyer who argues cases on behalf of religious groups, said he doesn't think the administration is hostile to religion. He says the administration takes the issues case by case. \"I think they've aggressively protected religious liberty in some issues and failed to protect it in other issues,\" Laycock says. \"But they're not hostile. The hostility is in parts of the political culture \u2014 particularly in the gay rights movement and the pro-choice movement.\" It's a larger culture war, he says \u2014 a fight that religious conservatives are worried about losing, particularly over gay rights. More and more people favor civil unions or marriage for gay couples, and more states are recognizing them. This new reality troubles Mathew Staver, founder of the conservative law group, Liberty Counsel. \"I believe the greatest threat to religious liberty is the clash between religious liberty and LGBT rights,\" he says. Staver says as rights for lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender people make gains, religious conservatives are having to set aside their convictions. A Christian counselor was penalized for refusing to advise gay couples. A court clerk in New York was told to issue same-sex marriage licenses, despite religious reservations. A wedding photographer was sued for refusing to shoot a same-sex wedding. Staver says these people aren't trying to impose their religious views on others. \"What people of faith don't want to do, however, is be forced to participate in something that literally cuts to the very core of their belief.\" Boston says of course religious believers want to impose their views on the world \u2014 witness the fight against same-sex marriage. But he says under the law, people can't discriminate based on their religious beliefs, any more than a restaurant owner can cite the Bible in refusing to serve black customers. He says the solution is simple. \"If you don't want to serve the public, don't open a business saying you will serve the public.\" What's happened in the past decade, Laycock says, is that the culture wars have become a zero sum game. When one side wins, the other loses. \"The conservative religious groups want to take away all the liberty of the pro-choice and gay-rights people, and the pro-choice and gay-rights people want to take away all the liberty of the conservative religious groups,\" he says. \"Neither side seems interested in the American tradition of 'live and let live' and protect the liberty of both sides.\" And Laycock sees little chance of a detente, particularly in an election year.",

Rick Santorum has been working hard this  week to capitalize on his strong showing in the Iowa caucuses, trying to convince Republicans in  New Hampshire  that he is presidential material. One thing he's not encouraging possible  supporters to do: Google him. That's because if they do, one of the top  results is a scatological and sexual site called SpreadingSantorum.com. It's got  a big brown blotch on it \u2014 and we can't say more than that. It's a political  stunt staged by columnist and gay-rights activist Dan Savage, who says he was  outraged by an interview Santorum did in 2003 when he was still a senator from  Pennsylvania. \"He argued that birth control should be  illegal and that states should have their right to arrest, prosecute and  imprison people for their private consensual sexual conduct,\" Savage  says. Savage was angered when Santorum went on  to say that states have the same right to regulate homosexuality as they do  pedophilia and bestiality. One of the readers of his column suggested that they  hold a contest to redefine Santorum's last name. \"And I thought that was a  good idea, tossed it in the column, people sent in suggested new definitions. I  ran a bunch of them, and I let my readers vote and they chose that one,\" he  says. Savage created the website and blog where  people can put updates about Santorum's political career, which faltered after  he lost his re-election bid in 2007. But with his strong showing in Iowa, people are looking  for information about Santorum. When they search his last name, the Savage blog  comes right up. Gabriel Stricker, head of Google's global  communications, says no one at Google is making an editorial statement. He says  their algorithms choose top search results based on objective  criteria. \"There definitely are people who are  finding this to be the best answer to their question, and they are indicating  this by either clicking on this result or linking to this result as the best  answer to that question,\" Stricker says. A lot of people click on the  SpreadingSantorum link every day to make sure it stays on top of the search  results. Stricker says Google often gets requests  from celebrities and political figures to take down sites or remove links from  the first page, but Google sticks to its algorithms unless the site incites  violence or breaks the law. The Santorum campaign did not respond to  NPR's requests for comment. However, in the past, Santorum has referred to his  \"Google problem.\" But Santorum can do something even if  Google won't change the search results. A whole industry has grown up to help  companies and public figures who also have Google problems. \"Because if you're not taking control of  it, someone else will,\" says Dorie Clark, CEO of Clark Strategic Communications,  a company that helps people with their digital marketing. Clark says the reality is that nothing on the Internet  ever goes away.  But Santorum  could make Savage's site less noticeable. \"He should be having an army of volunteers  blogging, recording podcasts, recording videocasts, because video especially is  prioritized in search engine rankings, and creating so much new information  about Rick Santorum that the search engines essentially forget about Dan  Savage's site,\" Clark  says. Clark says it's now up  to Santorum's campaign to give the public a lot more stuff to click on than an  online prank.",

Rick Santorum talks with a customer while surrounded by news crews as he pays a visit to customers at the Tilt 'n Diner in Tilton, NH, on Jan. 5. Now that he's getting his moment at the front of the GOP pack, former Pennsylvania Sen. Rick Santorum is drawing the kind of scrutiny he's escaped during all those lonely months at the bottom of the polls. On Morning Edition, NPR's Jeff Brady took a closer look at Santorum's reputation in Pennsylvania. And on Thursday's All Things Considered, Andrea Seabrook examined his record in the Senate, including his support for a ban on so-called partial-birth abortion. Friday morning, the New York Times digs into Santorum's post-Senate career. As the Times reports, after he lost his re-election bid in 2006, Santorum found consulting work with energy, health and lobbying companies he'd backed while in office: \"Certainly, Mr. Santorum would not be the first politician to take the  revolving door to greener pastures in the private sector,\" the Times reports. \"But a look at  his record both in and out of the Senate finds overlaps between the two,  suggesting that connections he made while in office helped soften the  sting of his unexpected re-election defeat.\" The piece does note Santorum's involvement in what became known as the K Street project, an effort to fill key lobbying and trade association positions with loyal Republicans. (It does not mention, however, that Santorum also appeared on the short-lived 2003 HBO series about Washington influence peddling, K Street.) Now that he's landed in New Hampshire, where voters are less friendly to social conservatives, Santorum's stance on social issues is also getting a closer look. Thursday night in New Hampshire, as Liz Halloran reported, Santorum drew fire from college students over his position on gay marriage. He has also declined to back away from recent comments he has made on birth control, like this one reported by a blogger in October: \"One of the things I will talk about, that no president has talked  about before, is I think the dangers of contraception in this country.\"  And also, \"Many of the Christian faith have said, well, that's okay,  contraception is okay. It's not okay. It's a license to do things in a  sexual realm that is counter to how things are supposed to be.\" Santorum reiterated his support for letting states outlaw contraception in an interview this week with ABC News' Jake Tapper. And on Morning Edition, Mara Liasson tells Linda Wertheimer that while Democrats would love to draw voters' attention to social issues, voters have other concerns. \"I think the economy is going to be the No. 1 issue,\" Liasson says. Interestingly, there are reports out of Iowa Friday morning that could make Santorum's new status at the top of the field official: results from Tuesday night's caucuses are not yet official and, with Mitt Romney the victor by just eight votes, one allegation suggests that the winner of the caucuses could be in doubt. Iowa GOP chair Matt Strawn issued a statement late Thursday asserting that he did not expect the overall outcome to change. And as Santorum told Nate Silver of the Times' blog FiveThirtyEight in an interview at his New Hampshire hotel, the official results are beside the point now: Mr. Santorum expressed a cheery indifference as to whether he  had technically won the caucuses. \"I always said in Iowa that I had to  beat Perry and Bachmann,\" he said. \"I didn't really ever think I was  going to win given where I was two weeks out. It just was fun watching  it going up and down.\"",

            "article_content": "Former House Speaker Newt Gingrich's poll numbers in Iowa continue to fall \u2014 in large part due to a barrage of negative ads over the last month attacking him. So after previously saying he'd only run a positive campaign, Gingrich is now hitting back.  LINDA WERTHEIMER, HOST: Newt Gingrich says, when it comes to his campaigning, he has been conducting an experiment. The former House speaker says he's been running a positive campaign as he competes for the Republican nomination. And if voters who say they hate negative campaigning practice what they preach, Gingrich says he'll do better than expected in Iowa. STEVE INSKEEP, HOST: But Gingrich also says he needs to set the record straight, and that means firing back at Mitt Romney. NPR's David Schaper is traveling with the Gingrich campaign. DAVID SCHAPER, BYLINE: A barrage of harsh television commercials attacking Newt Gingrich have taken their toll. A month ago, polls had Gingrich on top of the field of presidential candidates among Iowa's Republican voters. Then the attack ads started. (SOUNDBITE OF COMMERCIAL) SCHAPER: This one, like many of the anti-Gingrich ads, is funded by Restore Our Future, a Super PAC supporting Mitt Romney, which has spent more than $3 million attacking Gingrich. : For a state this size, to spend that number of dollars in negative ads aimed at one candidate, is pretty amazing. SCHAPER: But Gingrich admits they're working. Since the negative ads have been airing, Gingrich's poll numbers have plummeted. This weekend's Des Moines Register poll shows Gingrich getting the support of just 12 percent of Iowa Republicans. Gingrich was asked if he feels swift-boated. That's a reference to the 2004 ad campaign by the group Swift Boat Veterans for Truth targeting Democratic presidential candidate John Kerry. Gingrich said... : No. I feel Romney-boated. SCHAPER: And Gingrich has finally had enough. : I think if you have somebody spend three and a half million dollars lying about you, you have some obligation to come back and set the record straight. SCHAPER: First, Gingrich points out that the negative attacks on him haven't helped Romney. He says they've probably helped out former Pennsylvania Senator Rick Santorum the most, whose numbers are raising heading into Tuesday night's caucuses, while Romney's have remained steady. : Governor Romney remains, basically, a Massachusetts moderate. And he has not broken out, despite spending millions of dollars. SCHAPER: And, Gingrich says, he'll begin airing commercials to draw a contrast between himself and Romney. But with the caucuses taking place tomorrow night, his campaign did not say when those ads might air. Candidates Rick Perry and Michele Bachmann say they'll skip campaigning for the next contest in New Hampshire where Romney is heavily favored. Instead, they'll head straight to South Carolina, the third presidential voting state. But not Gingrich. : No. I think New Hampshire is the first - perfect state to have a debate over Romneycare, and to have a debate about tax paid abortions, which he signed, and to have a debate about putting Planned Parenthood on a government board, which he signed, and to have a debate about appointing liberal judges, which he did. And so I think New Hampshire is a good place to start the debate for South Carolina. SCHAPER: At LJ's Neighborhood Bar and Grill in Waterloo last night, Gingrich told the overflowing crowd he's probably been too passive in countering the ads that he calls false. But Bill Herkelman of Cedar Falls, who works for the Blackhawk County Sheriff's Office, says the negative ads haven't changed how he feels about Gingrich. BILL HERKELMAN: I am going to caucus for Newt Gingrich. I believe in his thoughts, I believe in his ability to lead. He is probably one of the most intelligent persons on the campaign trail, in my opinion. SCHAPER: And Kathleen Frank, of nearby Waverly, came away impressed with Gingrich too. But she says she and her husband are not sure yet if they'll caucus for him. KATHLEEN FRANK: We've met all of the candidates now so the next couple of days, we'll just be sorting them out and, kind of, making our decision probably at the last minute. SCHAPER: Gingrich is actually counting on undecided voters like the Franks. Many Iowans say they still haven't made up their minds, or could change them at the caucuses. And if they end up supporting Gingrich, his decision to start hitting back might pay off. David Schaper, NPR News in Waterloo, Iowa.

His candidacy brought the homegrown faith into the spotlight. Patrick Mason, a professor and chairman of the Mormon Studies program at Claremont Graduate University, says attention paid to his faith has been twofold. On one hand, it's been good for attracting new converts. On the other hand, it's turned Mormonism into something of a cultural punch line. \"South Park is a great example of this, The Book of Mormon musical is a great example of this, where people say, well, with increased attention comes increased scrutiny,\" he says. \"And there are parts of our past that people just won't understand.\" Mason says many people are skeptical of the church's origins, which involve the story of an angel directing Joseph Smith to golden plates and revealing a new Gospel. Many people are also dubious about claims that God lives on a planet named Kolob, or that people can become like God. And yet, he says, many Americans don't think twice about Jesus walking on water or God sending Jews manna from heaven, because those age-old stories have become part of the culture. \"So the story of Jesus' resurrection is now accepted by the vast majority of Americans, but the story of Joseph Smith digging up gold plates or seeing angels is subject to scrutiny,\" Mason says. A Fluid Faith Mormonism is a new religion, less than 200 years old, which means many of its claims can be easily confirmed or denied by modern science. For example, even most Mormon scholars agree there's no archaeological evidence that Jews came to America in 600 B.C., as Joseph Smith claimed, or that the Garden of Eden was in Jackson County, Mo. Faced with those evidentiary challenges, some Mormons have felt betrayed and left the faith. Many others, like Joanna Brooks, are trying to reconcile their religion with the science. Brooks, who's a professor at San Diego State University and author of The Book of Mormon Girl, says she focuses on the fundamentals, such as a belief in God, and in Jesus' role as savior. \"Other sort of fine points of doctrine, I deal with privately,\" says Brooks. \"And that's not uncommon in Mormonism.\" Mormonism has only a few non-negotiable beliefs. Unlike traditional Christianity, there are no Mormon creeds, no paid clergy, and no theologians who hammer out Mormon doctrine. For that reason, Matthew Bowman, author of The Mormon People, says many followers are fluid with their beliefs. \"Theology evolves over time within Mormonism,\" Bowman says. \"There is no pristine canon of theology laid down that is clear for everyone to go and look at if they have theological questions.\" Shifting With Time So, how does Mormon theology evolve? On rare occasions, a revelation from God is announced, such as when the church ended polygamy and when it allowed African-American men to become priests. But usually, Brooks says, theological changes are made with no fanfare. \"There are older stories that fade away and newer emphases that emerge,\" she says. \"There's a very subtle evolution that happens over time with older doctrines dropping out at times.\" For example, church leaders used to condemn contraception, but now couples are told to choose for themselves how many children they want to have. And church leaders haven't mentioned the planet Kolob \u2014 where God is supposed to live \u2014 since 1978. \"There's a cognizance today of what plays well and what will make Mormons sound strange,\" Mason says. \"And certainly talking about God living on Kolob is something that sounds strange and is something you won't hear Mormons talk about very much today.\" Mitt Romney delivers his concession speech Nov. 7. Though he generally kept quiet about his religion, Romney's candidacy brought Mormonism into the spotlight.\n                \n                    \n                    Charles Dharapak/AP\n                    \n                \nhide caption Mitt Romney delivers his concession speech Nov. 7. Though he generally kept quiet about his religion, Romney's candidacy brought Mormonism into the spotlight. The most notable shift in Mormonism lately is in its branding to appear as just another branch of Christianity. For example, in an effort to mainstream the religion, a series of commercials features Mormons from all walks of life \u2014 daughters, journalists, doctors, beach surfers \u2014 who loyally profess their belief on camera. \"I'm a husband, I'm a father, I'm an NFL football player,\" Chad Lewis says proudly in a commercial. \"And I'm a Mormon.\" Kristine Haglund, editor of the journal Dialogue: A Journal of Mormon Thought, says if there is a central tenet of Mormonism, it is this: What you do is just as important as what you believe. \"So, for instance, I can be a fairly liberal feminist, and it's OK; whereas if somebody saw me walking down the street drinking coffee from Starbucks, that would quickly make the rounds of the community gossip chain and be quite scandalous,\" she says, referring to the Mormon rejection of artificial stimulants, like coffee or tea. That principle of actions and beliefs weighing equally could explain Romney's rhetoric during the campaign. Instead of talking about what Mormons believe, he spoke of how his faith inspired him to help other Mormons. His campaign, Mason says, broke barriers the way John F. Kennedy's presidency did for Catholicism. \"I think this election cycle is the culmination of what we've seen in Mormonism for the past hundred years,\" he says. \"I mean, this is exactly what Mormonism has sought to achieve ever since it gave up polygamy and its political kingdom.\"",

            "article_content": "Sixty percent of the under 30 crowd went for President Obama in last week's presidential election. That number is nearly twice what Mitt Romney got from the same group. The total has many in the GOP worried.  STEVE INSKEEP, HOST: NPR's Tovia Smith has more on young voters. TOVIA SMITH, BYLINE: One commentator called it the demographic cliff. With young voters trending blue, and more and more of them coming of age each election, it doesn't bode well for the GOP. MEGAN HIGGINBOTHAM: What do y'all feel? SMITH: Twenty-three-year-old Megan Higginbotham sat in a local restaurant in Georgetown, Texas, this week, commiserating with other members of her Young Republicans Club - like 25-year-old Kristen Smith. KRISTEN SMITH: You know, I allowed myself to grieve. I let - you know, like, why didn't we win? SMITH: But they came less for a sob session, than for some serious soul-searching. These young people have watched so many peers vote Democratic because of social issues like abortion and gay marriage, they're wrestling with the same question as party leaders - whether the GOP should veer right, to energize its base; or moderate, to win over the middle. (SOUNDBITE OF SONG, \"SOME NIGHTS\") SMITH: They didn't mean it, but the song they picked for a slideshow recapping the election does reflect the tension in the party. Thirty-four-year-old Trevor Cheetham is one who says the GOP should just quit opposing gay marriage, for example. It's not only a loser for the party, he believes, but it's also un-Republican. TREVOR CHEETHAM: People are going to do what people want to do. Gay people, even though the government doesn't recognize it, they're still together. So why is the government involved in it, at all? SMITH: Another member, Eric Stratton, works with high school kids. With the nation facing a fiscal cliff, he says, it's like a knife in his heart to hear so many young people voting on social issues. In order to win them back, he says, the party doesn't need to change positions. It just needs to change the conversation. ERIC STRATTON: It's not that we abandon who we are, and what we stand for. It's a matter of, how do we make the message fit these constituencies that we know we need to make come alive? SMITH: Republicans can still win over young people, these activists say - if they have the right messenger, and if they stop letting others define them as intolerant, and lacking compassion. Kristen Smith says she feels that every day - as does her husband, who works with special-needs adults. SMITH: Every single time he tells somebody in his line of work that he's a Republican, they look at him funny. They're just like, really, you actually care? You're Republican. How awful is that? JAMES CHRISTOPHERSEN: Unfortunately, the Republican Party did a horrible job of defending it. SMITH: Twenty-five-year-old James Christophersen - with the Washington, D.C. Young Republicans - agrees the GOP doesn't need to moderate. It just needs to stand more firmly for what he calls its core values. CHRISTOPHERSEN: The lack of turnout of the base, is what killed us. And so the solution is for the Republican Party to do a better job of messaging the platform that they have in place now; and do a better job of finding candidates who genuinely believe in those ideas, and can accurately and articulately defend them. SMITH: Nearly 500 miles north, Harvard University Republican Club president Derek Bekebrede also worries about the GOP being seen as judgmental and extreme - for example, with comments about \"legitimate rape.\" But he cautions against a panicked lurch to the center. DEREK BEKEBREDE: I think there's a difference between saying we have to moderate, and we have to be  big tent. I think we can still welcome people with a variety of opinions, but we're still going to hold to the true platform. SMITH: Widening the tent, however, also has limits, as 21-year-old Owen Becker can tell you. He worked for Richard Tisei, an openly gay Republican who ran for Congress from Massachusetts. Tisei supports same-sex marriage and abortion - but still lost, Becker believes, because of his affiliation with a party that's seen as out of synch on those issues. OWEN BECKER: A lot of people see an R next to a name, and they just say, oh, well, they're just bad. And so it kind of - almost stops them at the door. SMITH: Growing up in Massachusetts, Becker has lived the extreme of what other young Republicans are just beginning to taste. In high school, he was the only one in his class not supporting Barack Obama. But, he adds, he also grew up a Red Sox fan. So he's used to being disappointed, and then coming out on top again. Tovia Smith, NPR News. INSKEEP: Mitt Romney is also analyzing the Republican defeat. In a call with donors, Romney said President Obama won by giving, quote, \"gifts\" to black voters, Latinos and young people. Romney suggested the president bought off targeted groups with immigration proposals; keeping the young on the health insurance plans their parents buy; and keeping contraception as part of the health plans that workers earn.

            "article_content": "Answering a question about pay equity for women during last night's presidential debate, Gov. Mitt Romney said something that has become the talk of the Web. He said that when he became governor, few women applied for cabinet jobs. \"And so we took a concerted effort to go out and find women who had backgrounds that could be qualified to become members of our cabinet,\" he said. \"I went to a number of women's groups and said, can you help us find folks? And I brought us whole binders full of \u2014 of women.\" During that part of the debate tweets revved up to 104,704 tweets-per-minute. And that phrase \"binders full of women\" became an instant Internet meme. It spawned the @romneysbinder twitter feed, a Tumblr blog and a Facebook page with close to 245,000 likes. Some of what's on there is cutting political commentary, some others are funny.

Romney, the Phoenix reports, did appoint 14 women to his first 33 senior-level jobs, \"a reasonably impressive 42 percent.\" But he didn't ask for that binder, the paper reports. A group of women called MassGAP had they decided they would assemble a list of qualified women, put all that info in binders and hand it to the whomever was elected governor. It's all fun and games, but you can be certain that both campaigns are fretting about this line today. As you've heard, over and over again this election cycle: Women voters matter \u2014 a lot. Update at 10:54 a.m. ET. Ryan Explains What Romney Meant: Vice presidential candidate Rep. Paul Ryan went on \"CBS This Morning\" to explain what his running mate meant when he talked about binders. \"All he simply meant was that he went out of his way to try to recruit qualified women to serve in his administration when he was governor,\" Ryan said according to a Politico transcript. \"That's really what he was saying.\" The New York Times, by the way, has picked up on the serious side of this debate. The paper just moved a story that looks at how this debate shifted the spotlight back to women. \"With some polls offering sporadic evidence that Mr. Romney is gaining support among women in the final weeks of the campaign, the president seized every opportunity during their face-off at Hofstra University on Long Island to assert that Mr. Romney, the Republican candidate, would eliminate financing for women's health services, block access to contraceptives, oppose equal pay and undermine the economic recovery for families in which women are the breadwinners,\" the Times reports.

            "article_content": "A nun chants while she and her sisters pray together during Vespers at their home near Dumfries, Va. Unlike older sisters shaped by Vatican II, a new generation of women are flocking to more conservative orders.\n                \n                    \n                    Barbara Bradley Hagerty/NPR\n                    \n                \nhide caption Fifty years ago, Pope John XXIII launched a revolution in the Catholic Church. The Second Vatican Council opened on Oct. 11, 1962, with the goal of bringing the church into the modern world. Catholics could now hear the Mass in their local language. Laypeople could take leadership roles in the church. And the church opened conversations with other faiths. For American nuns, Vatican II brought freedoms and controversies that are playing out today. Maureen Fiedler joined the Sisters of Mercy in September 1962. She was 19 years old and moved into a convent where she had limited contact with the outside world. A month later, Vatican II began. \"I found this to be the most exhilarating time in my whole life as a Catholic, because it felt like the petals of a flower were opening, and that there was a whole new fragrance in the air of the church,\" Fiedler says. Women religious, as they're formally called, became independent. They learned to drive a car and balance a checkbook. Many left their communities to live in apartments, closer to the people they served. And then there were the robes they wore. \"We dressed in these black habits from head to toe,\" says Sister Helen Prejean. \"We scared a lot of kids.\" Prejean was glad to see the habits go. When she entered the Sisters of St. Joseph at age 17, she says, the nuns were cordoned off from the world to pursue holiness and prayer. The call to be engaged with the world was not a call to throw the baby out with the bath water, doctrinally speaking or any other way. Colleen Carroll Campbell, author of \"My Sisters the Saints\" \"Then Vatican II came along and said, 'Start looking at the signs of the times, look at where the people are suffering, look at where the people are in need,' \" Prejean says. \"And I'm kind of a story, or an embodiment, of what happened to nuns out of Vatican II, because it brought me eventually to poor people in New Orleans and to death row.\" Prejean began working with convicted murderers. Her memoir, Dead Man Walking, drew the attention of actors Susan Sarandon and Sean Penn. Sarandon won an Oscar for her portrayal of Prejean in the movie based on her book. Prejean was not unusual. Many sisters threw themselves into social justice ministries and work for the poor. Fiedler, who now hosts the public radio program Interfaith Voices, fasted for 37 days in support of the Equal Rights Amendment. Encouraged by the newfound freedoms, she says, they pushed for more changes. \"We thought, 'Well, women priests can't be far behind. A married priesthood can't be far behind,' \" Fiedler says. \"What we didn't count on, I don't think, was that many forces and people within the Vatican had set their minds to rolling back the changes that Vatican II brought about.\" The Push-Back But some say the nuns went too far. \"The call to be engaged with the world was not a call to throw the baby out with the bath water, doctrinally speaking or in any other way,\" says Colleen Carroll Campbell, author of My Sisters the Saints and host of a series on the Catholic network EWTN. The Council Fathers intended to clear the underbrush, not light a forest fire; she says a reading of the documents from Vatican II makes that clear. \"Nowhere in those documents is there this vision of the church having a radical break with its 2,000-year history, and now, at the Second Vatican Council, everything is up for grabs,\" Campbell says. For more than a decade, the Vatican waited to see how this tug of war between tradition and modernity would play out, says Colleen McDannell, a historian at the University of Utah and author of The Spirit of Vatican II. Then, John Paul II became pope in 1978. The new pope, McDannell says, \"felt Vatican II was important, it was legitimate, but it had been interpreted incorrectly.\" The first open conflict between the nuns and John Paul II erupted in 1979 during his maiden visit to the United States. After one papal address, Sister Theresa Kane, a leader among the nuns, stood up to address the pope. \"The church in its struggle to be faithful to its call for reverence and dignity to all people must respond by providing the possibility of women as persons being included in all ministries of our church,\" Kane said. About 40 nuns were standing, wearing blue armbands as a symbol of their support for the ordination of women. Maureen Fiedler was there. \"You know, I was looking at him that day,\" she says, laughing. \"And it didn't look like he had a smile on his face. He seemed like he was thinking, 'Oh my, nobody vetted this speech, did they?' \" A Conservative Order Pope John Paul II favored a more traditional church, where authority resided in Rome, where altar boys were boys, and women religious centered their lives in community prayer. He favored communities such as the Dominican Sisters of St. Cecilia. On a recent evening, eight women from the order gathered in the basement chapel of their house near Dumfries, Va. They wore long white habits, bowing to the cross and to each other as they sang their evening prayers. These women live together, eat together and rise at 4:50 a.m. to pray together, which is the first of several community prayers. Sister Mary Jordon Hoover, principal of Pope John Paul the Great Catholic High School in Dumfries, Va., is a member of the Dominican Sisters of St. Cecilia. The order falls under the jurisdiction of the Council of Major Superiors of Women Religious, a more conservative organization.\n                \n                    \n                    Barbara Bradley Hagerty/NPR\n                    \n                \nhide caption Sister Mary Jordon Hoover, principal of Pope John Paul the Great Catholic High School in Dumfries, Va., is a member of the Dominican Sisters of St. Cecilia. The order falls under the jurisdiction of the Council of Major Superiors of Women Religious, a more conservative organization. Sister Mary Jordan Hoover joined the order in 1991 when she was a 25-year-old schoolteacher. She says she wanted to live a life \"set apart for the Lord.\" \"I wasn't attracted to living a religious lifestyle that looked just like the way I was living as a chaste laywoman teaching at a public school,\" she says. Hoover, the principal of John Paul the Great High School, is part of a fast-growing order based in Nashville, Tenn. Her community illustrates a generational and philosophical split among nuns. Unlike the older sisters shaped by Vatican II, Hoover says many young women are flocking to more conservative orders. \"I see that young people want to join congregations that have hours of prayer, times in community, faithfulness to the church, respect for bishops, love of Mary,\" Hoover says. \"All of these things, they don't put young women off. They're attractive.\" This was John Paul's, and now Pope Benedict XVI's, vision for women religious. \"The organizational church wants women to support the organization,\" McDannell says. \"They want women to promote a much more narrow range of social justice issues so that the bishops and the Vatican then can have good foot soldiers in their concerns.\" Past And Present But members of the generation shaped by Vatican II don't want to be foot soldiers. Fiedler says she's troubled by the bishops' focus on abortion, contraceptives and homosexuality \u2014 and their relative silence about poverty, the budget and war. \"A good number of nuns have serious questions about the positions that the bishops put forward, and so they're not anxious to jump in the fray and become, you know, warriors on the bedroom issues, if you will,\" she says. Those are fighting words \u2014 and earlier this year, the Vatican cracked down. It is reorganizing the Leadership Conference of Women Religious, which represents the vast majority of American nuns. It said the group has \"serious doctrinal problems\" and promotes \"radical feminist themes.\" I know the road I'm on is the road of the Gospel, so that's where my energies are. Sister Helen Prejean, author of \"Dead Man Walking\" \"I think it was important that this doctrinal assessment be done,\" says Campbell. \"It was important to many lay Catholics as well, because there's been so much confusion about what the church teaches, because so many women religious have either not proclaimed that teaching, or have openly dissented from it.\" Prejean says she was surprised by the harshness of the Vatican's criticism. \"But it didn't affect my life like, 'Oh my goodness, look what's happening here because they did this!' I know the road I'm on is the road of the Gospel, so that's where my energies are,\" Prejean says. McDannell says the story of the nuns over the past 50 years is not one of soaring freedom and then tragic crackdown. \"You know, this notion that somehow you've got this big, bad Vatican with a big stick, smacking these poor, innocent nuns around, infantilizes Catholic sisters,\" she says. \"I tell you, it's an even battle, and if I had to put money on it, I would bet on the sisters.\" The next generation of sisters may favor a more traditional church, she says, but the spirit of Vatican II is too much a part of their DNA to go back to the old ways.",

His comments came on the heels of the Bishops' campaign about contraception and they have led some see to see it as a political move.  ROBERT SIEGEL, HOST: Some Catholic bishops are ramping up their fight against gay marriage just weeks before the November elections. One archbishop says Catholics who support gay marriage should not take Communion. NPR's Barbara Bradley Hagerty has that story. BARBARA BRADLEY HAGERTY, BYLINE: Archbishop John Myers, of Newark, New Jersey, has been worrying about same-sex marriage for years. Finally, this week, he wrote a pastoral letter to his million-person flock and drew a line in the sand. REVEREND JOHN MYERS: Let's be honest about it, either you are with us on the important things or you're not. HAGERTY: Myers says same-sex unions undermine traditional marriage and conflict with both Catholic teaching and natural law. He says if a Catholic rejects a core teaching there should be consequences. MYERS: Those who support same-sex marriage are really removing themselves from fuller communion with the church. So it's not something that we do to them. It's some decision that they make for themselves. JOHN GEHRING: This is taking the church's opposition to same-sex marriage to a whole new level. HAGERTY: John Gehring works for Faith in Public Life, a liberal religious advocacy group. GEHRING: When you're telling Catholics who may have sons or daughters, or family members who are gay, you know, how to think about this issue, that's really scary. HAGERTY: For his part, Archbishop Myers says it's his duty to teach people the truth as the Catholic Church sees it. MYERS: I'm not controlling thought. I'm just asking them if they have the faith, which is in tuning with the church, to acknowledge the consequences of that faith or the lack thereof. HAGERTY: Gehring, who is a church-going Catholic, says Myers is not alone. The bishops are pouring money and resources into the fight against same-sex marriage. GEHRING: In several states they've ramped up the political pressure, the lobbying, the fundraising. Over 400,000 Catholic families in Minnesota are being asked to contribute money to political ads on this issue. So if that's not political, I'm not sure what is. HAGERTY: The new Archbishop of San Francisco wants to deny communion to any Catholic who is in an active gay relationship. The Archbishop of Baltimore co-hosted a fundraiser last night to fight gay marriage in Maryland. Bishops in Nebraska are encouraging priests to preach against Omaha's new law that bans discrimination against gay men and lesbians. Father Thomas Reese, at the Woodstock Theological Center at Georgetown University, says it's not new for the Catholic hierarchy to become politically involved in opposing same-sex marriage. FATHER THOMAS REESE: I think what's different this year is that the bishops are united in getting involved in pushing these issues; whereas, in the past, it tended to be individual bishops who would speak out. HAGERTY: Indeed, Cardinal Timothy Dolan, who heads the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops, is leading the fight. And it comes on the heels of the bishops' Fortnight for Freedom Campaign, in which they say that the Obama administration's birth control mandate threatens religious freedom. Reese says religious freedom and same-sex marriage are important issues. But he says they're getting all the attention. The bishops seem almost silent on issues such as unemployment and poverty and war. REESE: Those issues are way on the back burners for the bishops today. And that makes them sound very Republican and makes it look like they're endorsing the Republican Party. HAGERTY: Archbishop Myers says there's nothing political about his statement about same-sex marriage. MYERS: I did not write it with a view to wanting to enter the voting machine and push the button for people. I don't tell people how to vote. HAGERTY: Although he does say he doesn't mind that the November elections give his statement a little more horsepower. Barbara Bradley Hagerty, NPR News. Copyright \u00a9 2012 NPR.

Read Another Perspective On The Candidates' Ability To Clarify Their Positions. William Kristol is the editor of The Weekly Standard. \"So here we stand. Americans have a choice. A decision.\" \u2014 Mitt Romney acceptance speech,  Republican convention, Aug. 30, 2012 \"But when all is said and done \u2014 when you pick up that ballot to vote \u2014 you will face the clearest choice of any time in a generation. . . . On every issue, the choice you face won't be just between two candidates or two parties. It will be a choice between two different paths for America. A choice between two fundamentally different visions for the future.\" \u2014 Barack Obama acceptance speech, Democratic convention, Sept. 6, 2012 Mitt Romney and Barack Obama are agreed: The 2012 election presents the American people with a choice, not an echo. And the candidates are also right that it's a choice of uncommon clarity and consequence. Two roads diverge in the wood of American politics: Obamacare or patient-centered health care reform? The Ryan or the Obama budget? Supreme Court appointments in the vein of Sonia Sotomayor and Elena Kagan or in the spirit of Samuel Alito and John Roberts? A (slight) military buildup or (severe) defense cuts? Religious freedom or \"free\" contraceptives? The list goes on. And yet, in their respective convention speeches, the president and his challenger did little to clarify the nature of the choices being presented to the voters. Obama mentioned his signature legislative achievement, the Affordable Care Act, not at all; Romney cited it twice. You couldn't have had less budget detail from either candidate \u2014 and indeed the word \"budget,\" presumably judged by both camps to sound too harsh and restrictive, was mentioned once by Romney and not at all by Obama. Neither man mentioned the Supreme Court, though Romney did name-check the Constitution once \u2014 one more time than Obama. The military was judged worthy of brief discussion by both candidates for commander in chief \u2014 though Romney couldn't be bothered to mention Afghanistan or the troops fighting there, and Obama went out of his way to make clear that he didn't expect to do much war-fighting in his second term: \"After two wars that have cost us thousands of lives and over a trillion dollars, it's time to do some nation-building right here at home.\" Romney did mention freedom of religion, while Obama neglected to mention free contraception \u2014 but he may have felt his fellow Democrats had exhausted that topic. In sum, listening to Romney and Obama, to all of their windups and throat-clearing about how much is at stake in 2012 \u2014 and then listening to their reticence, not to say timidity, in explaining just what is at stake, one couldn't help but be reminded of the playground taunt: Are you a man or a mouse? Squeak up! Perhaps this is unfair. Convention speeches aren't policy documents. And it's not as if, beneath and beyond the squeakily cautious speeches, it isn't clear that there really is a lot at stake. It really is a big choice. Voters sense it. The candidates know it. And the candidates also know that though they could avoid coming to grips with their choices in prepared-text speeches before their own party conventions, they will have unscripted moments over the next two months. They will have interviews. They will have debates. They'll have to say more. They'll have to speak up. Mitt Romney in particular will have to speak up. Barack Obama went into the conventions a bit ahead in the race. We suspect he leaves the conventions still ahead \u2014 perhaps a little further ahead. Romney gained some ground when he chose Paul Ryan. But now he seems to be back to a pre-Ryan sort of campaign. When a challenger merely appeals to disappointment with the incumbent and tries to reassure voters he's not too bad an alternative, that isn't generally a formula for victory. Mike Dukakis lost. As the examples of Ronald Reagan in 1980 and Bill Clinton in 1992 suggest, successful challengers don't just jab lightly, parry punches, and circle the ring. They go for at least a few knockdowns. It's not enough to float like a butterfly. You have to sting like a bee. No sting, no victory.",

            "article_content": "He may not declare out loud, like Ann Romney, that he loves women. But President Obama certainly needs them. Obama's slight lead in national polls is almost entirely attributable to his support among women. It's an advantage Democrats intend to press throughout their convention this week in Charlotte, N.C. \"I can't understand why any woman would want to vote for Mitt Romney, except maybe Mrs. Romney,\" Madeleine Albright, a former secretary of state under Bill Clinton, told The Huffington Post on Monday. First lady Michelle Obama is scheduled to speak Tuesday in support of her husband's re-election bid, but Democratic differences with the GOP platform on issues such as abortion and birth control will be highlighted by other speakers \u2014 notably Sandra Fluke. Fluke, who will speak Wednesday, became widely known as a Georgetown University law student after talk show host Rush Limbaugh called her a \"slut\" in February following her testimony before House Democrats in favor of contraceptive coverage. \"Really, what's going on is that Democrats have to win the women's vote by a large percentage to overcome their disadvantage among men,\" says Lara Brown, a Villanova University political scientist. Democrats have not carried a majority of male voters in three decades, Brown says. As a result, she notes, Republicans triumph when they win among women \u2014 or at least come close. George W. Bush was re-elected in 2004 in part because he carried 48 percent of the women's vote, according to exit polling. House Republicans managed to carry 49 percent of women as they made historic gains in 2010. With Republicans in Congress and in the states pushing for more restrictions on abortion and even birth control this year, Democrats have spotted an opening. They believe that opening could widen into a large gender gap, following the roundly criticized comments of GOP Rep. Todd Akin, a Senate candidate in Missouri who said last month that women typically won't get pregnant as a result of \"legitimate rape.\" \"Voters are smart enough not to associate Mitt Romney with Akin's position on so-called legitimate rape,\" says Matthew Eshbaugh-Soha, a University of North Texas political scientist. \"But it reinforces the general impression that Republicans are out of touch on women's issues.\" Republicans say the Democrats' hammering at abortion and birth control amounts to a sideshow in an election that will ultimately be decided on other issues. Women are not monolithic in their preferences, says Republican pollster Ed Goeas, who notes that Obama's support among women is strongest among ethnic minorities \u2014 groups he's widely expected to carry as a whole. The president enjoys only a slight advantage among unmarried white women, while Romney is actually ahead among married white women, according to Goeas' latest numbers. \"For the overwhelming majority of the women voting in our direction, the focus is on spending, the economy, jobs \u2014 the same as everyone else,\" Goeas says. Republican positions on so-called women's issues are among the main ones Democrats feel are working in their favor at this point. Still, it remains to be seen how many voters the appearance of symbolically charged figures such as Fluke will bring into Obama's camp. \"I haven't seen any good evidence that women, or certain subgroups of women, are moving toward the Obama ticket over time or are becoming more enthusiastic about the Obama ticket,\" says John Sides, a George Washington University political scientist. \"And even if they were,\" Sides continues, \"could we attribute that to messaging about women's health? Not with any degree of certainty.\"",

If there's one thing that HBO's The Newsroom is especially good at, it's portraying journalists who aren't especially good at journalism. Well, maybe that's not fair. The fact is, they haven't had much opportunity to engage in journalism, since every major story that's come their way has been cracked not through know-how, persistence and telephonic grunt work but through the fortuitous involvement of people with whom the fictional News Night staffers happen to already be good buddies. Apparently, journalism is all about who you know, rather than how you go about knowing it. The most recent episode (\"The Blackout, Part II: Mock Debate\") took this trend to eye-rollingly ridiculous extremes by revealing that Lisa Lambert, roommate to associate producer Maggie Jordan and conflicted romantic target of producer Jim Harper, just so happened to have gone to high school with (real-life) infanticide defendant Casey Anthony. This narrowly edged out the time anchor Will McAvoy could have been the first to break the story about the Seal Team Six raid on Osama Bin Laden's compound if only he'd checked an email from his golf buddy Joe Biden. So as the show's first season galumphs to a halt with Sunday's upcoming finale, we wonder: What other unlikely relationships with folks embedded in the big stories of the past year will the characters on The Newsroom exploit in the episodes and seasons to come? Some predictions follow. 1. July 9, 2011: South Sudan secedes from Sudan to become an independent nation. Jim's erstwhile globetrotting ways had given him the opportunity to \"touch up\" an early draft of South Sudan's constitution to \"give it a little more zazz.\" 2. Fall 2011-Winter 2012: Occupy Wall Street is born. Back in college, Maggie was the star student of famed social-movements scholar Johann Occupy. 3. February 6, 2012: Queen Elizabeth II celebrates her Diamond Jubilee. Executive producer MacKenzie McHale once served as an apprentice to the Queen's corgi wrangler. 4. February 11, 2012: Whitney Houston dies. Will's bodyguard Lonny Church was the studio drum tech during the recording of \"My Love Is Your Love.\" 5. February 29, 2012: The Rush Limbaugh/Sandra Fluke birth-control flap. Blogger Neal Sampat once had a meet-cute with Fluke that they ruined by constantly pointing out that it was like living in a typical rom-com. (They remain Facebook friends.) 6. March 13, 2012: The Encyclopaedia Britannica discontinues its print edition. Producer Gary Cooper comes from a long line of encyclopedia salesmen. (Also offers Will the opportunity to deliver a blistering Sorkinian editorial about the sanctity of reference books qua books.) 7. Spring-Summer 2012: Charles G. and David H. Koch become ever more financially invested in the 2012 presidential election. During an all-staff meeting, ACN news president Charlie Skinner sheepishly reveals that he can get a News Night scoop on the elusive Koch brothers, being the secret fifth Koch brother himself. 8. May 9, 2012: President Obama announces his support for same-sex marriage. Booker Kendra James has an uncle in the Secret Service who has surreptitiously whispered \"Come out in favor of marriage equality... come out in favor of marriage equality...\" nightly into the President's ear as he slept. 9. June 28, 2012: Chief Justice John Roberts casts the deciding vote on health care. When ACN economist Sloan Sabbith was a Girl Scout, she was the Chief Justice's Samoas connection for four years running. (Only ever Samoas, for some reason.) 10. July 4, 2012: The Large Hadron Collider discovers what may be the elusive Higgs boson. Will's therapist Dr. Jack Habib once yelled at physicist Peter Higgs for not picking up after his dog in Central Park. 11. Summer 2012: Record drought and wildfires across the United States. ACN anchor Elliot Hirsch's first press job was as an environmental affairs intern at Ranger Rick magazine. 12. August 6, 2012: The Curiosity rover successfully lands on Mars. Producer Don Keefer and mohawked Curiosity Flight Director Bobak Ferdowsi once accidentally picked up each other's bags at the airport, had a good laugh once they untangled the mess a couple of days later.",

            "article_content": "When Missourians go to the polls Tuesday to vote on a number of candidates to compete in the November general election, they'll also be asked to decide on an amendment to the state's constitution. Amendment 2 is better known as the \"right to pray\" ballot measure.  STEVE INSKEEP, HOST: Life continues here on Earth, including in Missouri, where voters go to the polls tomorrow. They're being asked to decide on an unusual amendment to the state constitution. Those supporting it say the Missouri Right to Pray Amendment will clarify Missourians' right to practice their religion. Those against it are calling it redundant, too broad, even a little sneaky. Julie Bierach of St. Louis Public Radio explains. JULIE BIERACH, BYLINE: Supporters of the amendment say in recent months there have been a series of attacks on religious freedom. Some blame President Obama for trying to mandate that religious hospitals provide contraception. And some accuse the ACLU of suing when someone is only trying to practice their faith in public. Republican Missouri State Representative Mike McGhee sponsored the amendment and says he wants it to send a message. STATE REPRESENTATIVE MIKE MCGHEE: We are a religious country, and we want to take our country back, and we want to pray to God, and we can gather around the flagpole and say something to Jesus in our minds and in our hearts and it's going to be okay. BIERACH: Missourians already have religious freedom though, not only under the state but the U.S. Constitution. So critics call the measure and confusing, and some wonder if there's another motivation. GREGORY LIPPER: It's really just an ocean of legalese. I mean I'm a lawyer who's been practicing for almost a decade, and I have trouble understanding exactly what this thing really does. BIERACH: That's Gregory Lipper, an attorney with Americans United for Separation of Church and State. He says the amendment covers nearly every aspect of life, from schools to the town square to public meetings, and in trying to solve a problem that he argues doesn't really exist the first effect will be to spend lots of taxpayer money on lawyers. But here in Missouri, religious leaders are encouraging their congregations to vote for the amendment. Tyler McClay is an attorney and lobbyist for the Missouri Catholic Council. He acknowledges that while the amendment will not create a new constitutional right, and he agrees it's broad, he says that's not unusual. TYLER MCCLAY: Constitutional provisions tend to be more broadly written, and so they'll need to be interpreted or there'll need to be some clarification maybe down the road. But I don't think that's uncommon with this kind of thing. BIERACH: But critics have another problem with the amendment. Seventh grade science teacher Elizabeth Petersen takes issue with the ballot summary, or in particular what it leaves out. Nowhere does it mention that the amendment would allow students to opt out of assignments or presentations that violate their religious beliefs. ELIZABETH PETERSEN: It's absolutely sneaky, and you know, science is not about being sneaky. It's putting our cards on the table and saying here's what it says. BIERACH: Petersen says if the amendment passes, what constitutes a religious belief? Can a student decide they can't do their chemistry homework because the periodic table goes against their religion? If they opt out of a biology assignment because they don't believe in evolution, can they still pass the course? PETERSEN: That's the big question. I don't know. BIERACH: Amendment supporters say local school officials would establish guidelines for teachers, but retired science teacher Carol Ross-Bauman says teachers' and administrators' jobs are already hard enough and this amendment will only cause more problems that she says are unnecessary. CAROL ROSS BAUMAN: We're free to pray in school, and I promise there is praying going on in schools. And it's not just the praying that goes on before a test. There are kids who pray before they eat lunch. They have prayer groups, they do it in public, they do it out loud, the meet at the flagpole. BIERACH: Both teachers fear it's students who will suffer if opting out of critical science coursework is widely permitted. Elizabeth Petersen. PETERSEN: I think it's important that kids understand if you opt out of this, here's what your missing. I mean and in biology, because evolution is such a major understanding, you don't take biology, maybe you don't graduate. So I keep thinking, why would the legislators intentionally handicap kids? I mean it's bad legislation. BIERACH: The ballot summary was challenged in a lawsuit earlier this year, but a Missouri appeals court ruled it could remain on the ballot. A recent St. Louis Post-Dispatch poll reveals that the amendment is getting wide support and is likely to pass overwhelmingly. For NPR News, I'm Julie Bierach in St. Louis.

HIV infection rates are rising, as Greece's financial crisis has led the government to cut health and social services, including a successful needle exchange program. One of the alarming consequences of the financial crisis in Greece appears to be a sharp rise in the rate of HIV infection. The country, which is struggling through a historic debt crisis and a deep recession, still has one of the lowest HIV infection rates in Europe. But budget cuts to health and social services seem to be driving a recent and dramatic increase, especially among injecting drug users. About 20 recovering drug users gather daily at the Off Club, an outpatient community center in central Athens. On a recent day, one is making lunch wearing a surgical mask and gloves. \"We assume that everyone here either has AIDS or hepatitis C, so we have to be careful,\" says center director Panagiotis Saivanides. A 60-year-old recovering heroin addict who gives his name as Yiannis explains how he contracted hepatitis. \"I caught it because the pharmacies refused to give me clean needles,\" he says. \"I tried to buy a syringe but the pharmacist didn't even want to look at me, let alone give me anything.\" The rate of HIV infections (shown here by year per 100,000 people from 1984 to 2011) has seen a sharp rise since the beginning of the Greek financial crisis. Source: Hellenic Center for Disease Control and Prevention Credit: Angela Wong / NPR There had been a program for injecting drug users to exchange dirty needles for clean ones. But the government canceled this needle exchange program in 2011 because of budget cuts. Dirty needles are now responsible for a big increase in HIV infections. Sex, Drugs And The Spread Of HIV The country still has one of the lowest HIV rates in Europe. Only about 12,000 people have the virus in a country of 11 million. But the rate has gone up 60 percent since 2010. And among injecting drug users it's increased nearly 1,500 percent, according to the Hellenic Center for Disease Control and Prevention. A 35-year-old recovering heroin user who gives her name as Marilena says she knows HIV-infected injecting drug users who have sex for money. \"I know what they were doing on the streets,\" she says. \"I know what kind of people they had sex with, and that they never used condoms.\" Prostitution is only legal in licensed brothels, where sex workers are required to get regular health checks. Most of the 15,000 prostitutes in Greece work here illegally, mainly on the streets of central Athens, says Eleni Kakalou, a doctor who specializes in infectious diseases and treats people with HIV. \"And prices for commercial sex work have gone dramatically down,\" especially when addicts are using sex to pay for a fix, Kakalou says. \"They say they would have sex for 5 euros ($6). I've even heard 2.\" Earlier this spring, ostensibly as a pre-election crackdown on crime, police arrested 17 women with HIV who allegedly worked illegally as prostitutes. The names and photos of some of the women were posted on the police website. Kakalou says Greek authorities received more than 4,000 calls \u2014 mostly from middle-aged men with families who said they had unprotected sex with the women. Vicky, a 40-year-old, Canadian-born, Greek drug addict, takes a drop of her own blood from a syringe as she prepares to inject herself with a mix of cocaine and heroin on a central Athens side street, April 30.\n                \n                    \n                    Yannis Behrakis/Reuters/Landov\n                    \n                \nhide caption Vicky, a 40-year-old, Canadian-born, Greek drug addict, takes a drop of her own blood from a syringe as she prepares to inject herself with a mix of cocaine and heroin on a central Athens side street, April 30. \"I think that just the fact that people are buying in these conditions commercial sex and they demand the non-use of condom as many of them have families \u2014 women, children that are completely unaware \u2014 shows the fact that there is a huge gap of knowledge and perception,\" she says. Need For Better Strategy, And On A Budget Yet others in Greece believe they can contract HIV simply by shaking the hand of an HIV-positive person, says a man who gives his name as Marco. He's gay and got the virus 13 year ago through unprotected sex. He says HIV is still a very stigmatized disease. People \"are scared of touching you\" and \"of the air, of the water, of everything\" around you, he says. Most people living with HIV in Greece are gay men. Marco says that the most people in the gay community are careful about condom use, though he acknowledges that he still knows of risky behavior. Apostolos Veizis, head of the medical support team for Doctors Without Borders, wants Greece to set up a strategy for educating more people about HIV to stop its spread, especially among injecting drug users. \"All of us saw a situation going out of control,\" Veizis says. \"It's something that did not come from one day to another. Authorities were seeing the situation, and I think they did not do anything, essentially, responding to the problem.\" At the very least, the government does plan to restore the needle exchange program. But what else can be done, since the country is broke?

Read Another Opinion About The Obama Campaign's Tactics Read An Opinion On The Impact Of Mitt Romney's Refusal To Release Tax Returns Fred Barnes is executive editor of The Weekly Standard. The usual strategy for presidential candidates is to appeal to the political center in hopes of broadening their support. President Obama isn't doing that. He is tilting sharply to the left on issue after issue: immigration, religious liberty, welfare, gay marriage, the environment, race, the role of government. Why? The simplest answer is that his bid for reelection is in trouble, and he's going where he has the best chance of finding friendly faces. In fundraising, you rely on folks who've donated before. Obama is going after voters who've voted for him before. But why focus his campaign on them? Didn't Obama long ago lock up the various liberal elements and interest groups who make up the Democratic Party's base? Yes, but their mere support is not enough. He needs them to swarm to the polls and vote in the same massive numbers they did in 2008. At the moment, that seems unlikely. A poll in mid-July by Resurgent Republic found that Republicans are more enthusiastic about voting in the presidential election than either Democrats or independents. Sixty-two percent said they're \"extremely enthusiastic,\" compared with 49 percent of Democrats and 45 percent of independents. In truth, Obama has few alternatives to trying to jack up the Election Day turnout of his base. Pollster Whit Ayres of Resurgent Republic believes Obama has given up on going after white working-class voters. His share of their vote has dipped below 30 percent in polls. And while he won independents handily in 2008, recent surveys show that crucial bloc favors Romney. Obama's emphasis on liberal issues won't appease independents \u2014 and may alienate many of them. He has a separate plan for overcoming their disaffection: trashing Romney. His personal attacks and campaign ads characterize Romney as a capitalist buccaneer unfit to be president. If those work, independents \u2014 a few million, anyway \u2014 may reluctantly settle for Obama as the lesser evil. But arousing the base is still key. \"He has gone to the left on everything as aggressively as he can,\" says Scott Reed, a Republican consultant who ran Bob Dole's presidential campaign in 1996. And on practically every issue he can. The Obama administration's imposition of a rule requiring health insurance policies to provide free birth control pills and free sterilization thrilled liberals, especially feminists. His blocking of the Keystone XL oil pipeline from Canada to the Gulf Coast of Texas made the environmental lobby happy. By an executive order of dubious constitutionality, Obama changed immigration law to allow roughly one million illegal immigrants to remain in the country free from arrest and deportation \u2014 an unabashed effort to increase the Hispanic vote. His attorney general, Eric Holder, has noisily criticized voter ID laws as thinly veiled attempts to prevent African Americans from voting. Two weeks ago, the administration announced another policy shift to please liberals. By bureaucratic directive, it decreed states could abandon the requirement that welfare recipients seek work. Intentionally or not, this gutted the welfare reform law of 1996, the most significant achievement of Bill Clinton's presidency. Besides Hispanics and African Americans, Obama has wooed gays by announcing his support for same-sex marriage. This also had the intent of unleashing a flood of campaign contributions from wealthy gays, just as the Keystone decision was expected to spark donations from environmentalists. In pulling off these unsubtle moves, Obama has had an ally. Republicans and conservatives complained about all of them, the Catholic bishops are furious over the unprecedented requirement that Catholic employers provide health insurance that violates their church's teaching, and the about-face on enforcing immigration law drew strong attacks. But the mainstream media were sympathetic to the president's actions, either downplaying them or openly siding with Obama, and the protests died down. The notion that Obama was purposely veering away from the center was rarely noted. But the impact of Obama's latest pitch to the left, delivered on July 13 at a firehouse in Roanoke, Virginia, is likely to linger. Except for the conservative press, the media largely ignored his speech. Yet it was memorable for his denigration of success in business and glorification of government. Obama's hostility to business, the profit motive, and wealth in general is no secret. During the 2008 campaign, he talked up income redistribution, telling Joe the Plumber that \"when you spread the wealth around, it's good for everybody.\" In 2009, he suggested that doctors often gouge their patients by insisting on more treatment than necessary. This reflects a \"business mentality,\" he said. In 2010, he said he didn't \"begrudge success that's fairly earned.\" Then he added: \"I mean, I do think at a certain point you've made enough money.\" In his Roanoke riff, he outdid his previous hymns to government. The thrust of his argument was that government, even more than personal initiative and hard work, is responsible for the success of individuals. \"If you've got a business \u2014 you didn't build that,\" he said. \"Somebody else made that happen.\" He cited projects like the Hoover Dam and Golden Gate Bridge as evidence \"you're not on your own.\" The Obama campaign quickly sensed a backlash. When Mitt Romney read the \"you didn't build that\" quote at a rally, it responded with a TV ad declaring \"that's not what [Obama] said.\" Not true. Romney, gazing down at a text, had read the comment accurately, word for word. Perhaps it was better, at least for campaign purposes, to deny the quote rather than try to explain it. Who would believe Obama didn't mean exactly what he said? His history, his earlier comments, his policies \u2014 all stand as evidence of his loathing of business, profits, and affluence. Obama's campaign advisers appear confident of winning. Their contempt for Romney is palpable. But their cockiness is unearned, particularly when appealing to liberals is the best strategy they've got.",

            "article_content": "It's not just states where abortion is heating up as an issue this election year. Congress is getting back into the fray, too. On Wednesday, the House Judiciary Committee approved, on a party-line vote of 18-14, a bill that would ban abortions in the District of Columbia after 20 weeks of pregnancy. Congress frequently exerts control over the city and its governance, much to the chagrin of the district's elected officials and residents. The law is one of several of a similar type that have passed in multiple states. They challenge the premise of the Supreme Court's holdings about the legality of abortion by attempting to restrict the procedure prior to viability with no or only very limited exceptions for the pregnant woman's health status, on the contested medical theory that the fetus can feel pain at a certain point in gestation. Until recently, abortion rights groups had not challenged the bans, possibly fearing that they would lose at the Supreme Court. The makeup of the court has become more conservative since the last time the justices considered a major abortion case. But that changed last week, when the American Civil Liberties Union and the Center for Reproductive Rights, along with a group of abortion providers, sued to block Arizona's new law, which is set to take effect next month. Arizona's law would ban abortions more than 20 weeks after a woman's last menstrual period, which is approximately 18 weeks after fertilization. That is far earlier than most of the other laws and would be too soon, say doctors who are part of the lawsuit, to allow the detection of some serious fetal deformities. Meanwhile, Congress, or at least the GOP-controlled House of Representatives, is taking on abortion restrictions in other vehicles. The annual spending bill for the Department of Health and Human Services, which is slowly making its way to the floor, includes a raft of abortion-related provisions. They include complete defunding of the federal family planning program, a separate ban on federal funding for Planned Parenthood until it pledges to stop using non-federal funds to pay for abortions, and a ban on using funds to implement rules requiring most health plans to provide birth control coverage. Meanwhile, those challenging that controversial birth control rule aren't faring so well in court. On Monday, a federal district court judge in Nebraska dismissed a suit brought by the attorneys general of seven states. Judge Warren Urbom said the states lacked standing to sue. Then on Wednesday, U.S. District Judge James Boasberg in Washington ruled against North Carolina's Belmont Abbey College in a similar suit challenging the rule. Judge Boasberg said that while the school might be affected by the requirement, the Obama administration has pledged to seek a compromise that would allow religious organizations not to violate their beliefs while still allowing women to receive no-cost contraception. \"The government, moreover, has done nothing to suggest that it might abandon its efforts to modify the rule \u2013 indeed, it has steadily pursued that course \u2013 and it is entitled to a presumption that it acts in good faith,\" Boasberg wrote. Several other lawsuits challenging the rule, however, are still pending around the nation.",

The bishops say the campaign is a response to government attacks on religious liberty, but critics say it's an attack on the Obama administration. The Catholic Church is drawing a line in the sand. Perceiving its core beliefs to be under threat from popular culture, the White House and even Catholics themselves, the Vatican and the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops are pushing back. In recent months, the church leadership has been cracking down on liberal theologians, disciplining nuns and emphasizing a more orthodox theology. The most recent example is the bishops' response to the new health care law. After the Obama administration announced that religious universities, hospitals and charities must offer insurance plans that cover birth control, the bishops swung into action. The group sued in federal court. They warned religious organizations and believers that birth control is intrinsically evil. And the Conference launched the Fortnight for Freedom campaign, asking the faithful to pray, fast and attend special Masses about religious liberties in the two weeks leading up to July 4. Enforcing Conservative Theology Many Catholics view the controversial campaign as an anti-Obama move in an election year. I just think we're in an era with secular culture where compromise can be fatal in a way that was not the case in the past. ... So we're seeing an attempt to find an equilibrium Rusty Reno, editor, First Things magazine \"The Fortnight for Freedom is becoming a kind of marker of being a good Catholic,\" says David Gibson, a Religion News Service reporter who has written several books about the Catholic Church. \"It's an effort to kind of rally the troops to recreate this unified Catholic community that's really disappeared in the last 50 years,\" he says. Gibson and others say, increasingly, the church appears to be enforcing a conservative theology. The Vatican has instituted a more traditional liturgy and has openly criticized or censured several liberal theologians in recent months. And, Gibson notes, the Vatican made two significant announcements in a single week in April: First, that it wants to reconcile with the ultra-conservative Society of St. Pius the X, and secondly, that it will reorganize the Leadership Conference of Women Religious, which represents 80 percent of Catholic sisters. As justification for the reorganization, the Vatican accused the group of \"radical feminism.\" It also accused the nuns of failing to emphasize sexual issues like birth control and same-sex marriage as much as their work on poverty and injustice. Gibson says those two nearly simultaneous announcements are a telling coincidence. \"Rome is doing everything it can to bring a schismatic right-wing group that rejects the reforms of Vatican II back into the fold,\" Gibson says, \"while at the same time, it's censuring nuns and theologians who are actually following the spirit of Vatican II.\" Attempting 'To Find Equilibrium' Fabian Bruskewitz, bishop of Lincoln, Neb., says the nuns are a \"precious treasure,\" but that some of their leaders were promoting ideas about sexuality that were at odds with the Catholic Church. When it comes to core doctrines, Bruskewitz says, the church is not a democracy. \"These are not open to votes,\" Bruskewitz says. \"These are what God has revealed, and the custody of that revelation is of course in the possession of the church.\" Bruskewitz says the church can't compromise its views just because the secular world doesn't like them. \"Some lady [asked] me a short time ago, 'Why don't you adopt what is socially acceptable \u2014 divorce, contraception and so on?' I said, 'Well that's not the criterion for morality.' \" \"I just think we're in an era with secular culture where compromise can be fatal in a way that was not the case in the past,\" says Rusty Reno, editor of the conservative Catholic magazine First Things. If anything, Reno says, the church became too liberal after Vatican II, as people interpreted reform as license to defy the church. \"So we're seeing an attempt to find an equilibrium,\" Reno says. Father Thomas Reese, a fellow at the Woodstock Theological Center at Georgetown University, sees the changes within the church less as an attempt at equilibrium than a dramatic swing toward the right. The shift began, Reese says, with Pope John Paul II. Alarmed by Vatican II, the pope set out to rein things in. First, Reese says, the pope began cracking down on liberal theologians who dissented from the Vatican in an attempt to \"control the message.\" And second, he says, the pope appointed conservative bishops loyal to the Vatican \u2014 the men who are running the U.S. Catholic Church today. On matters of sexuality and morality, he says, these bishops brook no dissent from the faithful. \"They see themselves as teachers,\" Reese says. \"They teach what they consider the truth. If the students don't accept it, that's the students' problem, not theirs.\" Reese says today's church leaders remind him of parents of teenage children. \"They realize they're losing control,\" he says, \"and they think the solution is simply to shout louder, and to say, 'No, you can't do that,' or, 'Not in my house, you won't,' or, 'Because I said so!' \"That's simply not going to work with an educated laity,\" Reese says. 'Maybe Our Time Has Come' Reese believes that top-down approach, combined with the bishops' handling of the sex abuse crisis, has alienated many of the faithful. Polls show that one-third of people raised Catholic no longer attends church. That may not be a bad thing, says Bill Donohue, president of the conservative Catholic League and author of Why Catholicism Matters. Donohue notes that Pope Benedict XVI has intimated that a smaller, more orthodox church might be better anyway. If people are so dissatisfied, Donohue says, why don't they just join a liberal denomination, like the Episcopalians? \"I think for a long time, what I would consider the base of Catholic Church \u2014 the ones who practice, who go to church regularly and who pay the bills, generally of a more conservative stripe \u2014 we feel like we've been neglected,\" Donohue says. \"And now we feel like, 'Hey, maybe our time has come.' \" It certainly feels that way to John Gehring, a church-attending Catholic who works for the progressive advocacy group Faith in Public Life. Gehring says the Church he loves used to care as much about poverty and social justice as sexuality. \"I believe in a 'big tent' Catholicism, where liberals and moderates and conservatives can get along,\" Gehring says. \"We share a faith, we share rituals, we break bread together. But this is as much my church as it is Bill Donohue's church.\" And so Gehring plans to stay \u2014 and hopes that one day, the pendulum will swing back his way.",

Organizers voiced their opposition to Health and Human Services Mandate, which requires all employer-offered health insurance to cover contraceptives. Read Another Opinion On The Affordable Care Act Joshua Carback is an editor at the student newspaper at Geneva College. While many Catholic organizations are suing Secretary of Health and Human Services (HHS) Kathleen Sebelius over the Obama administration's new contraception rules, unhappiness with the supposed HHS mandate \"compromise\" runs even deeper. Many Protestant institutions are also trying to overturn the compromise that coerces private religious institutions to fund health insurers who can provide beneficiaries with abortion-inducing drugs. Among these Protestant institutions is Geneva College, a small Christian liberal arts institution of about 1,800 students founded by the Reformed Presbyterian Church of North America (RPCNA), located just north of Pittsburgh. Geneva is certainly no stranger to the task of feuding with the federal government on matters of constitutionality and religious freedom. The school first became notable for its fierce resistance toward the federal government after the passing of the Fugitive Slave Act in 1850, occurring shortly after the college was founded. Geneva has joined hands with the Alliance Defense Fund (ADF) \u2014 a coalition of Christian lawyers who litigate on matters regarding religious freedom \u2014 in pressing suit. ADF estimates that it would cost Geneva $500,000 annually in fines (about a $2,000 fine per employee) should the college choose to violate the mandate out of conscience. \"It's not a compromise,\" says Dr. Thomas Copeland, professor of political science at the college. \"Fundamentally, religious institutions still have to pay for it; it just puts a layer of paperwork between the insurance company and the employee.\" \"The best word to describe how he has treated Christians is 'trampling,'\" says Leah Achor, a senior studying political science at Geneva. \"I think there's a backlash across the county, and people who know about this mandate will not be okay with the way that Obama has put this in place.\" But not everyone at Geneva supports the college's stance on this matter. Dr. David Guthrie, professor of higher education and sociology, expressed reservations about the lawsuit, complaining of the incivility he believes may accompany discussions of abortion, including on Christian college campuses. As Republicans hope Mitt Romney will dismantle what they believe to be one of the most harmful presidencies in this nation's history, one thing is clear: religious conservatives, and even many religious social moderates, are very upset. Obama's actions have brought together various religious groups with theological differences that might otherwise have kept them apart. President Obama's 2008 campaign coalition was, at least in part, built around his ability to win over moderate Catholics and Protestants. With Protestants and Catholics coming together to oppose the president's HHS, Obama has made prospects of rebuilding his successful 2008 coalition more unlikely. Solidarity between organizations such as the Catholic Church and the National Association of Evangelicals, as well as the Union of Orthodox Jewish Congregations of America and others on this issue, clearly indicates that the contraceptive rule has a cost. With multiple religious factions fighting the HHS mandate, it is possible the rule will be overturned in court, or simply by pressure from religious groups. But relief might take another form: the election of Mitt Romney as president of the United States in November.",

The U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops launches what it's calling the \"Fortnight for Freedom\" on Thursday \u2014 two weeks of praying and fasting because the bishops believe the church's religious freedom is being threatened by the Obama administration's health care policies. \"This is the first time that I've felt personally attacked by my government,\" parishioner Kathleen Burke says after a service at Our Lady of Lourdes Catholic Church in Bethesda, Md. At stake, Burke says, is the federal health care law, which requires religious universities, hospitals and charities to offer insurance plans that cover birth control \u2014 an issue the Catholic faith opposes. Another parishioner, Tom Shuler, says the government has always made exceptions for religious organizations to adhere to their beliefs, until now. \"The Obama administration and all of the accompanying executives there are clearly anti-religious,\" Shuler says. He accuses the White House of imposing a secular worldview and narrowing the definition of a religious organization. \"Lookit, Mother Teresa could not operate in the United States,\" Shuler says. \"Jesus could not operate in the United States right now.\" His wife, Jamie, is delighted the bishops are fighting back. \"Obama has brought this on himself,\" she says. \"If he doesn't want to play with fire, then don't light the match.\" Advocating Religious Liberty With Strong Rhetoric The Fortnight for Freedom campaign, which runs through July 4, includes special Masses and sermons devoted to the theme. Radio spots and videos produced by the bishops conference accuse the Obama administration of taking \"the first step to deny religious liberty.\" Archbishop William Lori of Baltimore, who is heading the campaign, says the bishops have a simple goal. \"We're trying to protect our institutions and our fundamental freedoms as individuals,\" he says, \"and so this seemed to be the moment that we have to draw the line in the sand.\" Archbishop William Lori of Baltimore, shown speaking at the state Capitol in Hartford, Conn., in 2009, is the head of the U.S. bishops' Fortnight for Freedom campaign.\n                \n                    \n                    Jessica Hill/AP\n                    \n                \nhide caption Archbishop William Lori of Baltimore, shown speaking at the state Capitol in Hartford, Conn., in 2009, is the head of the U.S. bishops' Fortnight for Freedom campaign. The rhetoric is pretty strong. Cardinal Timothy Dolan of New York, who leads the bishops conference, says the White House is \"strangling\" the church. The bishop of Oakland warns of \"despotism.\" And then there was an April sermon by the bishop of Peoria, Ill., Daniel Jenky. \"Hitler and Stalin, at their better moments, would just barely tolerate some churches remaining open,\" Jenky says in the video, adding that the dictators would not allow the church to compete in education, social services or health care. \"President Obama with his radical pro-abortion and extreme secularist agenda now seems intent on following a similar path,\" he says. Lori says the times call for blunt language. \"Sometimes prophets are thought to be unduly alarmist, and sometimes their speech is a little bit strong,\" the archbishop says. \"But that's what prophetic speech always has been.\" He contends Catholics are fully behind the campaign, dismissing a poll by the Public Religion Research Institute that found 57 percent of Catholics are not worried about their religious liberties. A Plea For Nonpartisan Preaching Marion McCartney, who attends the Shrine of the Most Blessed Sacrament in Washington, D.C., opposes the bishops' campaign. She's part of a group, Blessed Sacrament Families United in Faith and Action, that wrote a letter to its pastor, saying the partisan nature of the campaign is \"a step too far.\" \"Nobody's religious freedom is at stake. That's just ridiculous!\" McCartney says. Is \"[Health and Human Services Secretary] Kathleen Sebelius going to come and close all the church doors? I mean, it's just foolishness.\" Another member of that group is Jim Zogby, who has worked on human-rights issues overseas. He says the U.S. bishops were spoiling for a fight over social issues with the Obama administration. \"They declared war on the administration, and we the faithful are paying the price for it,\" Zogby says. \"Our religious freedom, our ability to simply go to church, worship, feel a community, feel safe in that community\" has been compromised. \"We're now being put in the middle of a partisan fight, and that's wrong.\" His wife, Eileen, says Blessed Sacrament, with its mix of liberals and conservatives, has always put politics aside. Not now. At a recent parish meeting about religious freedom, people began attacking President Obama, she says, getting more and more heated. Nobody's religious freedom is at stake That's just ridiculous! Marion McCartney, parishioner at the Shrine of the Most Blessed Sacrament in Washington, D.C. \"Until finally one person leaned forward and he said, 'Well, I have seen cars in our parking lot with Obama stickers on them, and they are complicit in all of this.' And I thought, 'Well I guess I'm not welcome here, because I have an Obama sticker on my car.' \" University of Notre Dame historian Scott Appleby says the bishops have lost credibility with many Catholics. There is a valid concern about the health care law, he says, but many Catholics aren't listening because they're unhappy about the sex abuse crisis and the Vatican's investigation of nuns in the U.S. \"Many Catholics are thinking, 'Well there they go again,' \" Appleby says. \"That's unfair in this situation, but it's understandable because the bishops have been perceived to have made one wrong turn after another for at least the last decade.\" Some Catholics are also uncomfortable with the timing of the Fortnight for Freedom campaign, coming just a few months before a presidential election. Lori says the White House started it. \"We did not go looking for a fight in an election year,\" he says. \"It was handed to us.\" The archbishop adds that if they don't act now, it will be too late.",

            "article_content": "Senate Democrats knew they had little chance of passing the Pay Fairness Act on Tuesday, but they see lots of promise for its politics. Blending economics and gender politics, the bill hit the sweet spot of the Democrats election year strategy to target female voters.  ROBERT SIEGEL, HOST: From NPR News, this is ALL THINGS CONSIDERED. I'm Robert Siegel. AUDIE CORNISH HOST: And I'm Audie Cornish. Republicans in the Senate blocked a vote on the Paycheck Fairness Act today, a bill aimed at closing pay disparities between men and women. The defeat of the bill is not a surprise. Democrats knew the likely outcome before ever bringing the bill up. But as NPR's Tamara Keith reports, this is an election year when many votes are as much about getting the opposition on the record as passing legislation. TAMARA KEITH, BYLINE: By now you've heard about the Republican war on women. Democrats don't want voters, particularly coveted female voters, to forget about it. First, there was the issue of contraception. Then came the Violence Against Women Act. You might say the Paycheck Fairness Act is a sequel. Here's Senate majority leader Harry Reid. SENATOR HARRY REID: It's clear where Democrats stand. We stand for equal pay for equal work and it's time for Republicans to stop denying the reality that millions of women face every day and work with us to give women the pay equality they deserve. KEITH: Reid also took the opportunity to attack GOP presidential candidate Mitt Romney on the issue. REID: He should show some leadership and tell his fellow Republicans that opposing fair pay for all Americans is shameful. KEITH: Romney's campaign says he supports pay equity for women, but he did not take a position on the bill. The fact that he and his fellow Republicans had to once again explain their position on women's issues appears to be exactly what Democrats want. In the Senate, they keep bringing up bills related to women, bills they know Republicans don't support. Nevada Senator Dean Heller was the only Republican to address the Paycheck Fairness Act on the Senate floor today. SENATOR DEAN HELLER: This proposal couldn't pass when Democrats controlled both chambers of Congress. Yet, here we are today voting on the same measure again and again. And those who are actually victims of workplace discrimination are only getting lip service from Washington. KEITH: And despite all the politics, the bill's author, Democratic Senator Barbara Mikulski from Maryland, points out women earn just 77 cents for every dollar made by a man in the same position. She says that's the real war on women. SENATOR BARBARA MIKULSKI: It's one bullet every paycheck when you're discriminated against. Every time you get a paycheck and you're making less than the next person, that's a war against women. KEITH: The bill would protect women from retaliation from their employers for trying to seek equal pay. Republicans objected, saying it would lead to frivolous lawsuits. With the war on women narrative apparently likely to continue, House Republicans are trying to get off of defense. They recently launched the women's policy committee, complete with a video featuring GOP women.

            "article_content": "The Catholic Archdiocese of Washington, D.C., is up in arms over Georgetown University's invitation to Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius to speak during commencement weekend. Church officials are upset about Sebelius' role in the creation of the contraception mandate in the federal health reform law. It's one of several controversies surrounding graduation speakers that have cropped up this spring.  ROBERT SIEGEL, HOST: Kathleen Sebelius, the secretary of Health and Human Services, will address students at Georgetown University tomorrow. As NPR's Barbara Bradley Hagerty reports, that has created one of several controversies this season over commencement speakers. BARBARA BRADLEY HAGERTY, BYLINE: Sebelius is Catholic. She's also liberal and pro-choice. And the fact that she's speaking to Georgetown's Public Policy Institute makes conservative Catholics, like Patrick Reilly, see red. PATRICK REILLY: Well, this is clearly a betrayal of the bishops. HAGERTY: Riley is president of the Cardinal Newman Society. He notes that Sebelius is the architect of the Obama administration's requirement that Catholic universities and hospitals offer birth control coverage. REILLY: This is not someone who the Catholic Church, or Catholic institutions, should be honoring. HAGERTY: The Archdiocese of Washington asked the Jesuit university to rescind the invitation. [POST-BROADCAST CORRECTION: The Archdiocese of Washington did not ask Georgetown to withdraw its invitation.] Georgetown spokeswoman Stacy Kerr says it will not. STACY KERR: Her visit does not mean that the university endorses her positions. In fact, those who speak at Georgetown do not speak for Georgetown. HAGERTY: It's the season of commencement protests. Some liberal students demanded that Emory University revoke its invitation to neurosurgeon Ben Carson because he does not subscribe to evolution. It did not. But this year, protests have been more visible at Catholic institutions. Social conservatives demanded that Gonzaga University disinvite Archbishop Desmond Tutu because of his support for gay marriage and abortion. It did not. Conservatives had more luck at Anna Maria College, which did rescind its invitation to Victoria Kennedy, widow of Edward Kennedy. Stephen Schneck, a political scientist at Catholic University of America, says Catholic schools have two missions. One is to convey the teachings of the Catholic faith. The other is to be a university. STEPHEN SCHNECK: That is a place that's open for intellectual discourse and pursuit of the truth. And those two things occasionally run into tension with one another.

            "article_content": "Updated @ 2:14 pm ET -- Strategic Perception Inc., the ad firm whose principal, Fred Davis, was mentioned in a story about a proposed superPAC anti-Obama attack-ad campaign that would use Rev. Jeremiah Wright, has now issued a statement: \"The document referred to in today's New York Times story was one proposal prepared and submitted by Strategic Perception, Inc. The Ricketts family never approved it, and nothing has happened on it since the presentation. The vendors listed were as proposed, and had nothing to do with this proposal.\" Updated @ 1:14 pm ET \u2014 Politico reports that billionaire conservative Joe Ricketts is seeking to distance himself from a proposed superPAC attack-ad campaign against President Obama that would have featured the president's old Chicago pastor, Rev. Jeremiah Wright. Meanwhile, Mitt Romney told TownHall.com, the conservative web site, that he \"repudiate(s)\" the superPAC proposal. \"I repudiate the effort by that PAC to promote an ad strategy of the nature they've described. I would like to see this campaign focus on the economy, on getting people back to work, on seeing rising incomes and growing prosperity \u2014 particularly for those in the middle class of America. And I think what we've seen so far from the Obama campaign is a campaign of character assassination...\" - original post, with revisions, below - Much attention is being paid Thursday to a New York Times story that a superPAC funded by Joe Ricketts, the conservative and superwealthy founder of brokerage TD Ameritrade and patriarch of the family that owns the Chicago Cubs, has proposed an ad campaign that would use \u2014 wait for it \u2014 Rev. Jeremiah Wright against President Obama. Republican efforts to undermine Obama by deploying the controversial Wright failed to stop the Obama juggernaut in 2008. Meanwhile, much of the world seems to have moved on from the retired United Church of Christ cleric whose Chicago church Obama once belonged to. But apparently not everyone has. NPR correspondent Ari Shapiro who has been covering both the Obama and Mitt Romney presidential campaigns talked with an official in the Obama re-election team to get some reaction, Ari writes: \"I just talked to an Obama campaign official on background. They don't think this particular line of attack can be effective four years into the presidency, but they're worried in general terms about a sneak attack funded by somebody's private fortune...\" Obama campaign manager Jim Messina has issued an official statement on behalf of the president's re-election effort: \"This morning's story revealed the appalling lengths to which Republican operatives and superPacs apparently are willing to go to tear down the President and elect Mitt Romney. The blueprint for a hate-filled, divisive campaign of character assassination speaks for itself. It also reflects how far the party has drifted in four short years since John McCain rejected these very tactics. Once again, Governor Romney has fallen short of the standard that John McCain set, reacting tepidly in a moment that required moral leadership in standing up to the very extreme wing of his own party.\" Ari adds that the Obama campaign doubts that the proposed attack against Obama could be effective. Why? Because voters have already made up their minds about Obama's character and, for the most part, approve of it. The Obama campaign official told Ari that the president's personal character attributes have always been what's polled highest throughout the presidency. Obama is no longer the relatively unknown state senator who emerged quickly on the national scene. According to the official, the American people know Obama which helps explain why when the question is who shares your values or who's fighting for you? Obama outpolls the other side by 20 to 30 points. Ari said the official told him the campaign doesn't think the attack is going to work since voters, if nothing else, tend to see Obama as decent person. That's why Romney on the stump nearly always says Obama's a nice guy but in over his head. Romney knows that ultimately, voters like Obama. The official went on to say that Romney was presented a leadership moment when he was asked Thursday morning whether Wright was fair game and replied he replied \"I haven't read the papers.\" That was different than Sen. John McCain 2008 approach when, as the GOP presidential nominee, he said Wright was off limits. Romney failed, at least initially, to take a stand against the superPAC proposal, the official said, likening it to to the Sandra Fluke incident, the Georgetown University law student who was insulted by Rush Limbaugh during the debate, earlier this year, about mandated health insurance coverage of contraceptives. Matt Rhoades, a Romney campaign spokesperson, responded to the Times story about the possible super PAC attack ad campaign using Rev. Wright by saying: \"We repudiate any efforts on our side to do so.\" Ari reports that the Obama campaign official wasn't buying it. The Obama official who didn't want to be identified based that reaction on the fact that Romney has already appeared to accuse Obama of trying to deChristianize the U.S.: \" ROMNEY: 'I think again that the president takes his philosophical leanings in this regard, not from those who are ardent believers in various faiths but instead from those who would like America to be more secular. And I'm not sure which is worse, him listening to Reverend Wright or him saying that we must be a less Christian nation.' [Hannity Radio, 2/7/12]) ARI: \"More broadly, the campaign is absolutely concerned about attacks that can come out of nowhere funded by one individual's private fortune without any oversight or coordination with a campaign.\"",

Mitt Romney is now virtually certain to capture the GOP nomination. Read Another Opinion On Santorum Suspending His Campaign Read Another Opinion On How Santorum Changed The GOP Primary Ben Adler reports on Republican and conservative politics and media for The Nation as a Contributing Writer. On Tuesday afternoon former Pennsylvania Senator Rick Santorum announced he is suspending his campaign for the Republican presidential nomination. Although his departure means that Mitt Romney's nomination goes from assumed to certain, Santorum has had a meaningful impact on the course of the Republican primary. He revivified the religious right and pushed his opponents to extremes on a host of issues. Liberals tend to imagine the conservative base as implacable opponents of moderation and pragmatism. But in one crucial respect they are sophisticated political actors. They have long recognized that they cannot always ensure that every Republican nominee is a true believer in all their values. But rather than just picking up their toys and going home like Ralph Nader voters, they try to exercise influence in the Republican primary process to bring the nominee as far in their direction as they can. That's why they have so many doctrinaire policy pledges, and the Tea Party has targeted incumbent senators for even the most minor infractions. To force the front-runner to address your concerns, you need leverage, which comes from a credible threat of defection. Mitt Romney, who ran in Massachusetts as a supporter of abortion rights and is now trying to move back to the center for the general election, is exactly the sort of mainstream Republican that the conservative movement excels at pushing around. Romney will be as moderate as he can get away with, to maximize his chances of winning the general election. But being so lacking in principle, he will also, when necessary, swerve far to the right to appease conservatives. And that is what he has to do repeatedly to fend off Santorum's challenge. It was hard to imagine, even when staunch social conservatives such as Michele Bachmann and Rick Perry led the Republican field, that the primaries would become dominated by contraception. Few living politicians have made a point of decrying the immoral behavior that they believe contraception encourages. But Rick Santorum is one of them. Prior to this campaign Santorum's political identity was dominated by two concerns: a social conservatism that could veer into homophobia, and a hawkishness that could veer into paranoia. Santorum has been beating the drum for a confrontation with Iran for years. His incessant fear-mongering on the campaign trail and in Republican debates \u2014 like his bizarre assertion that the United States faces a socialist/Islamist/terrorist threat from Latin America \u2014 has helped the GOP find its voice on foreign policy. President Obama has prosecuted the war against Al Qaeda much more effectively than did President Bush. That has left Republicans in a bind, unsure of whether they should follow their reflex to characterize Obama as weak, as they typically denigrate Democrats, when they lack any evidence to support such a claim. Especially with Ron Paul's isolationist candidacy picking up enthusiastic support, Republicans were left flailing, attempting to somehow criticize Obama from the left and right simultaneously on issues such as Libya. Santorum, the most reliable proponent of neoconservative belligerence on the Middle East, argued forcefully with Paul in the debates and showed the way forward on foreign policy for other Republicans. The GOP message \u2014 that Obama has shown weakness towards adversaries such as Iran, China and Russia \u2014 may be absurd on the merits, but at least it's a tangible concept. And it fits nicely with the Republican tendency to treat foreign policy as merely a swaggering expression of domestic nationalist identity politics. Romney has recently pivoted towards painting President Obama as weak on national security. On social issues, Santorum gave the religious right a reason to get out of bed. In recent years they had been supplanted by the Tea Party as the voice of right-wing populist anger. With Perry and Bachmann they had unserious candidates. When Santorum emerged in Iowa as a legitimate contender, religious conservative leaders had someone to coalesce around. Santorum ultimately won the majority of their endorsements. His candidacy also demonstrated the ongoing political importance of evangelicals. In state after state, Santorum, a Catholic, won evangelicals, along with overlapping groups such as \"very conservative\" voters. Romney, a Mormon, won non-evangelicals, including Catholics. While some commentators have suggested this is a sign of social progress because it means voters no longer reflexively favor their co-religionists, it has a whole other implication. What Santorum's strength shows is that evangelical Christian Republicans continue to hold a strong preference for candidates who are intensely conservative on social issues and overtly religious. They alone are not quite large enough to single-handedly give such a candidate the Republican nomination, but their cohesive voting behavior means they remain a powerful force in the party. Santorum even moved the debate rightward on economic policy. To shore up his fiscally conservative bona fides, Santorum had an economic platform that was far to the right of Romney's. Santorum would have cut taxes far more dramatically. In February, feeling a need to fend off Santorum's challenge, Romney changed his own tax plan, making it much more extreme and more like Santorum's. Since then economic issues have been eclipsed by Republican hysteria over the possibility that some religious institutions will be forced to provide reproductive health coverage for their employees. While Santorum can hardly claim sole credit for execrable developments like the introduction of the Blunt-Rubio amendment to let employers opt out of covering treatments they find morally objectionable, his presence in the race has surely helped keep the spotlight on these issues that many women mistakenly thought were long settled. Just a few years ago Santorum was a national laughingstock. He had lost re-election by an astonishing eighteen points. His most famous quote was a vulgar comparison between homosexuality and bestiality. Googling him brought up a mocking definition of his name. Now he is dropping out \u2014 at the right time, unlike Newt Gingrich \u2014 as the runner-up for the Republican presidential nomination. The last runner-up will be the nominee this time, just as the runner-up from 2000 was the nominee last time. If Santorum never makes another public appearance, he will have permanently changed the first line of his obituary from having left politics as a diminished joke back to being a significant right-wing leader. And this may not be the last we will hear from him.",

            "article_content": "President Obama says the disappointing jobs numbers from March show that more needs to be done to strengthen economic security. He addressed the numbers during a White House conference on women in the economy. NPR's Scott Horsley explains the president is making an aggressive appeal to women as part of his re-election campaign.  SCOTT SIMON, HOST: A weaker than expected jobs report is a setback for President Obama as the election nears. The president says that while private employers have added some four million jobs over the last two years, economic security remains elusive. The president spoke yesterday at a White House conference on women in the economy, and as NPR's Scott Horsley reports, voters who are women may be the key to the president's political future. SCOTT HORSLEY, BYLINE: President Obama says it's perfectly natural that politicians are paying special attention to women these days, but he was quick to add, women are not a monolithic voting block, or just another interest group. PRESIDENT BARACK OBAMA: Women are over half this country and its workforce, not to mention 80 percent of my household if you count my mother-in-law, and I always count my mother-in-law. (SOUNDBITE OF LAUGHTER) HORSLEY: The White House issued a report highlighting its efforts to promote women's economic security, but Mr. Obama says even now women earn just 77 cents for every dollar that men make. OBAMA: When more women are bringing home the bacon, but bringing home less of it than men who are doing the same work, that weakens families, it weakens communities, it's tough on our kids, it weakens our entire economy. (SOUNDBITE OF APPLAUSE) HORSLEY: Yesterday's conference came as the president's re-election team has been aggressively courting women voters and accusing Republicans of waging a war on women. Dianne Bystrom who heads the Catt Center for Women and Politics at Iowa State University says the effort appears to be working. A recent USA Today Gallop Poll of a dozen swing states found Mr. Obama enjoys an 18 point lead over Mitt Romney with women voters. DIANNE BYSTROM: All of this discourse going on right now has brought a very sharp focus to an emerging gender gap which is certainly something that could play out in the general election in President Obama's favor. HORSLEY: Bystrom says women have leaned Democratic for decades, but not by this much. Another poll by the Pew Research Center found a similar advantage for Mr. Obama with women nationwide, while men voters split pretty much down the middle. Bystrom suspects the recent controversies over birth control and Planned Parenthood have hurt Republicans with women voters. Romney's tried to downplay these issues while focusing attention elsewhere, including on his wife Ann. MITT ROMNEY: My wife has the occasion, as you know, to campaign on her own and also with me, and she reports to me regularly that the issue women care about most is the economy and getting good jobs for their kids and for themselves. HORSLEY: But Bystrom even when women and men have similar concerns, they don't always favor the same solutions. The Pew Poll, for example, found women more supportive of an active role for the government. BYSTROM: As wife, mother, sisters, you know, especially the sandwich generation that takes not only care of their children, but their elderly parents, women more than men thought the government should take an activist role in helping elderly people, children and poor people. HORSLEY: Bystrom also says women seem less concerned about the deficit and less hawkish about Iran than men, differences which could make them more supportive of the president. Four years ago, Bystrom says candidate Obama was less aggressive about making a specialized pitch to women, perhaps mindful many had backed his primary opponent, Hillary Clinton. This year she says Mr. Obama can't afford such restraint and can't take any potential supporters for granted. BYSTROM: Democratic candidates need women to turn out and turn out in large numbers and vote predominantly for them to win elections, and so I actually think we're going to see more targeting of women voters by President Obama in this election than we did in 2008. HORSLEY: Even without that targeting four years ago, almost ten million more women than men showed up to vote. Neither party could afford to ignore that kind of outsized influence.

Rallies took place nationwide to protest the mandate that some religious organizations cover the cost of contraception. Across the country, thousands of people skipped lunch Friday to protest what they see as a threat to religious liberties in the United States. The protesters' specific complaint was the birth control mandate in the new health care law, but the discontent runs far deeper. It didn't take much for the Rev. Pat Mahoney, an evangelical minister, to warm up the crowd in Washington. He gazed out at hundreds of people who filled the plaza in front of Kathleen Sebelius' office at the Department of Health and Human Services. \"Come on,\" Mahoney urged the crowd. \"We want Secretary Sebelius to hear you!\" Beyond Birth Control Earlier this year, Sebelius announced that the nation's new health care law would require some religious organizations, like Catholic hospitals and universities, to provide birth control coverage to employees. Many conservative Catholics and evangelicals \u2014 not to mention the Catholic bishops \u2014 were furious at the announcement. That anger sparked the nationwide rallies, dubbed \"Stand Up For Religious Freedom.\" Kristan Hawkins, head of the organization Students for Life, says the contraception requirement is an attack on religion \u2014 and that the Obama administration is sending a hostile message to believers. \"This is where tyranny begins,\" she told the boisterous crowd. Kathleen Burke, a Catholic who took the day off to attend the rally, says the White House is stepping into people's private lives. \"The government has no business telling me what I need to buy,\" Burke says. \"What, are you going to tell me I need to buy broccoli next?\" Nearby, Patty Weaver, a home schooling mother and evangelical, says the mandate is an affront to American ideals. \"People came over here \u2014 the Pilgrims \u2014 not for free health care,\" she says. \"They came over for freedom. And we're losing our freedom. We're losing it every day.\" Rallies like this one took place in approximately 140 places across the country Friday. Hundreds turned out in Philadelphia, including Episcopalian Robert Mansfield, an Iraq war veteran. \"We didn't travel 7,000 miles to have the government tell us how we're going to practice our faith. If they're coming after the Catholics, they're coming after us next,\" Mansfield says. In Nashville, Tenn., evangelical Teresa Reff worries that people of faith soon won't be able to practice any type of religion in public. \"They've taken prayer out of school; they've taken Scripture-reading out of school. They want to get rid of the Bible clubs that are in school,\" she says. \"It's just systematic taking-away, and if we sit by and do nothing, then we'll be like Communist Russia or China where it's against the law to even go to church.\" A Vocal Minority As lively as these rallies are, pollster Robert Jones of the Public Religion Research Institute says they're not representative of the views of most Americans. \"Most Americans \u2014 including most Catholics \u2014 do not believe that the right of religious liberty is being threatened in America today,\" Jones says. Jones says the group most worried about an erosion of religious freedom is white evangelicals. And in this election year, they're joining forces with conservative Catholics and finding a cause they can rally around.",

            "article_content": "Public Policy Polling is a Democratic-leaning survey firm based in North Carolina. Within just a few years of its founding, the company has become one of the most prolific polling outfits in the country. And during this election cycle, its polls have strengthened their reputation for predictive accuracy.  MELISSA BLOCK, HOST: Just a few years ago, not many people outside North Carolina knew of a small start-up called Public Policy Polling. It was founded by a Democratic businessman with no political experience. These days, PPP is one of the most prolific polling companies in the country, along with Gallup and Rasmussen. From North Carolina Public Radio, Jessica Jones has the story of a political start-up turned success story. JESSICA JONES, BYLINE: If you're a news junkie, you've probably already heard of Public Policy Polling. (SOUNDBITE OF NEWS CLIPS) JONES: Just about every talking head from Comedy Central to Fox News knows PPP well. That's a lot of national air time for a relatively new polling firm with only four full-time staff members in Raleigh, North Carolina. Businessman Dean Debnam is the founder. DEAN DEBNAM: It's actually taken us since 2001 to get here. And for the first eight or nine years of that, nobody knew who we were. JONES: Debnam is a soft-spoken, jeans-clad entrepreneur who runs two other successful companies. He started PPP after he got tired of seeing local Republican polls he didn't think were accurate. DEBNAM: I decided that the highest and best use of my time was to invest in something that made Democrats more competitive in races. And one of the things to do was to make polling more affordable. JONES: Traditional pollsters like Gallup still use real people to call prospective voters, but that's expensive. So Debnam set aside company phone lines for automated calls. PPP's polls cost as little as $1,500 for clients who range from local school board candidates to big Democratic interest groups. TOM JENSEN: We have two new dialers going in and that will get us up to being able to make 400,000 phone calls a day. JONES: Tom Jensen is Public Policy's director of polling. He points to a tall tower of big black metal boxes with thick cables looping out the back. JENSEN: These are the dialers. These little boxes are what make all of our phone calls. JONES: For automated polls like this to be successful, tens of thousands of responses must be whittled down into small, perfect voter samples. While traditional pollsters remain wary of this methodology, the firm has acquired a reputation for accuracy. Emory University political scientist Alan Abramowitz says PPP's methods have made it a real competitor. ALAN ABRAMOWITZ: They've become the sort of liberal and Democratic alternative to Rasmussen is the way I would describe them. JONES: Rasmussen is the favorite automated pollster of conservatives. But Abramowitz says Rasmussen suffered accuracy and bias problems in 2010. ABRAMOWITZ: I think that even if you got an organization like Public Policy Polling, they have a good track record, but you just wonder how long they can maintain that. JONES: Despite its hard-won reputation, PPP's work for Democrats and liberal groups occasionally raises hackles. A recent example was a poll on Catholic attitudes toward contraception that was sponsored by Planned Parenthood. Although the firm leans Democratic, staffers say they have no qualms about exposing flaws in Democratic causes and candidates in order to strengthen the party. And Director of Polling Tom Jensen says Public Policy is working hard to maintain its accuracy. JENSEN: Ultimately, the biggest thing is just experience. For most swing states, we're polling those swing states more than any other polling company in the country. And just the more you poll a certain place, the better you're going to be at it. JONES: Jensen enjoys putting together wacky polls too, including a survey last year asking independent voters whether they'd support Sarah Palin or Charlie Sheen for president. Charlie Sheen won. But PPP hasn't neglected its original client base of Tar Heel Democrats. Alan Norman won his first election as a rural sheriff two years ago. He says Tom Jensen's polls helped him identify crucial voters. ALAN NORMAN: He said, you know, here's your weak area and here's where you need to go. And he gave us the numbers. He said you need to zero in and work harder on 65 and older, retired individuals, such as my parents. JONES: Norman says, by following PPP's advice, he won the public office he'd always coveted. And Public Policy Polling got what it wanted too: another Democrat in public office. For NPR News, I'm Jessica Jones in Durham, North Carolina. Copyright \u00a9 2012 NPR.  All rights reserved.

His religious views have featured in his presidential campaign. Read Another Opinion On Pertinent Political Topics Jeffrey Bell is a writer for The Weekly Standard. Despite reports of Republican devastation in the contraception debate, social conservative themes show surprising signs of hanging around. Rick Santorum's upset wins in Alabama and Mississippi \u2014 in most pre-primary polls he was running third \u2014 are part of the story. So are CNN exit polls that suggest no-exceptions pro-life voters accounted for considerably more than his margins of victory. Of the primary electorates in the two states, 32 percent of Alabama voters and 28 percent of Mississippi voters told CNN, \"Abortion should be always illegal.\" Among these hard-line socially conservative voters, Santorum outpolled Newt Gingrich and Mitt Romney in Alabama, 49 to 28 to18, and in Mississippi, 44 to 30 to 21. He won the two primaries by 6 and 2 percentage points, respectively. Well, that's the Deep South for you. But what about deep-blue Massachusetts, where Democratic candidate Elizabeth Warren has fallen behind Senator Scott Brown since rolling out a high-profile advertising campaign on behalf of the Obamacare contraception mandate? Brown hit back with ads accusing Warren of wanting to \"use the power of government to force Catholics to violate the teachings of their faith,\" citing his Democratic predecessor Ted Kennedy as a supporter of conscience exemptions. The debate dominated the Senate race for several weeks. Its upshot led Boston Globe reporter Frank Phillips to write, \"[I]f several of the recent polls are correct, Brown may have benefited from his positions on social issues in the last few weeks, such as the one over whether Catholic institutions should be forced to provide contraception in their health care plans for workers.\" National popular reaction to the Obamacare mandate has varied considerably depending on how the question is phrased, but overall the mandate has received very mixed reviews. The latest New York Times /CBS poll found opposition to the mandate in regard to religiously affiliated employers, 57 to 36, and opposition to the mandate for all employers, 51 to 40 \u2014 the harder-line version was narrowly voted down in the Democratic-controlled U.S. Senate. The same poll showed President Obama falling from 50 to 43 approval \u2014 its finding of a month ago \u2014 to 41 to 47 disapproval. Although non-social factors, such as rising gas prices, were undoubtedly involved, it's hard to believe that the simultaneous explosion of debate over the contraception mandate could have been all that devastating for Republicans. This impression is confirmed by the new Washington Post/ABC polling showing Mitt Romney taking the lead over Obama in the last month, with gains among both male and female voters. Romney is assumed to be the social moderate in the GOP field, and it's true that distrust on the part of socially conservative voters is an ongoing problem for him. But whatever the level of distrust, in his day-to-day campaign Romney is not trying to present himself as even a millimeter to Santorum's left on social issues. He recently called for zeroing out all of Planned Parenthood's federal subsidies, and has run commercials critical of Santorum for failing to take a similar position during his years in the Senate. Will 2012 be one of those presidential years in which social issues play a significant role in the general election? In a cycle so far dominated by a stagnant economy, no one is predicting this. But, then, virtually no one predicted social issues would rise to the top in 1988 or 2004, the post-Reagan elections in which they did so. Republican elites who fear such a development should keep in mind that 1988 and 2004 were also the only two post-Reagan elections in which their party won a popular majority. The signs are growing that this is a history capable of repeating itself.",

Despite Super Tuesday's results, which favored Romney, the GOP search for a presidential candidate continues. Read Another Opinion On The GOP Presidential Candidates Michael Warren is a reporter for The Weekly Standard. Is Mitt Romney the best remaining Republican candidate to go up against Barack Obama in the fall? Or would Rick Santorum, the most likely alternative, fare better in a general election? An experimental study conducted by the firm Evolving Strategies suggests Romney may have the advantage over Santorum in a general election, but not for the most obvious reasons. First, a note about the survey model. Evolving Strategies uses experimental data to understand how communication and advertising strategies affect voters, much in the way product advertisers determine how to craft television and radio commercials. In this experiment, survey respondents were broken into three groups. The first group watched two television advertisements about Mitt Romney: a positive one and one attacking him. The second group watched two similar ads about Santorum, one positive and one negative. The third group, the control, watched nonpolitical ads. Then, each respondent answered questions to gauge how he or she would vote in a general election. This method attempts to measure the effect of the campaign ads on voting preferences. The results of such an experiment can be predictive. In December, when Newt Gingrich had reached his peak popularity within the Republican presidential field, Evolving Strategies conducted a similar survey among Republican primary voters. The most telling result was that the former House speaker seemed to be very vulnerable to negative ads. Those who viewed both positive and negative ads about Gingrich were considerably less supportive of him than those in the control group. In other words, the negative ads worked. The experiment prefigured what weeks later became reality, when a barrage of negative advertising from Romney and his super-PAC effectively sank Gingrich. So what did this latest survey discover? The results suggest that Romney is the superior general election candidate. While the control group \u2014 those respondents who watched nonpolitical advertisements \u2014 split their support evenly at 40 percent between Obama and Romney (standing in as a \"generic\" Republican candidate), those who watched the Santorum ad treatment, both positive and negative, favored Obama to Santorum 45 percent to 38 percent. On the other hand, those who watched the Romney ad treatments favored Romney over Obama 44 percent to 35 percent. That's a statistically significant difference. Based on these results, Romney would perform better against Obama than would Santorum. Why is that the case? The general election ads the respondents viewed were specially created for this study. The positive ad the Romney group watched featured two sides of the Romney pitch: an explanation and defense of his business experience, and a contrast between his free-market vision for the economy and Obama's government-driven vision. \"President Obama's brand of capitalism sends your money to his friends' companies,\" Romney says in the video. \"I will, instead, make America the most attractive place in the world for entrepreneurs and innovators and job creators, and get America working again.\" The negative Romney ad, something akin to what Obama might run in the fall campaign, focuses on Romney's years at Bain Capital. \"Why isn't Romney concerned about the poor?\" the text reads after video of Romney's post-Florida primary gaffe. The ad ends with Romney arguing with protesters about the nature of corporations. \"Everything corporations earn ultimately goes to people,\" says a haggard-looking Romney in the hot Iowa sun. \"Where do you think it goes? Whose pockets? Whose pockets?\" The results suggest this line of attack against Romney may not hold up in an election about the economy, particularly if Romney rebuts the criticisms by directly challenging the president's own economic policies. In fact, when the survey asked respondents whether or not they believed Obama's economic policies would work, those in the Romney group were less inclined to believe they would work than those in the control group. What about the Santorum ads? The positive ad focuses first on Santorum's vision for the country. \"It's an election about what kind of country you're going to leave the next generation,\" Santorum intones. \"Are we going to be a country that believes, as our Founders did, that our rights don't come from the government, they come from a much higher authority?\" Following that, Santorum clarifies his position on contraception by explaining that his \"public policy position is that this contraception should be available.\" The ad also shows Santorum touting his economic plan, quoting the Wall Street Journal's definition of it as \"supply-side economics for the working man.\" Continued At The Weekly Standard",

The 2004 Democratic presidential nominee echoed Obama by saying Romney's bellicose talk only aided Iran by helping to raise oil prices. Romney's campaign and its allied superPAC funneled resources into Mississippi and Alabama, which hold primaries next week, in an attempt to help the front-runner make a better showing in the South than he has up to now. Two Alabama polls did little to shed light on what GOP voters are likely to do in that state next week, with one recent poll giving Romney a 10-point lead and another giving Rick Santorum a lead of four points. Interestingly, neither poll had Newt Gingrich, the candidate from neighboring Georgia, in the lead or in second place.

DeFrancesco Soto is a fellow at the Center for Politics and Governance at the LBJ School of Public Affairs at the University of Texas. Last night Romney won an outright majority of the delegates, but Santorum decisively emerged as the moral and ideological leader of Republican primary voters. Super Tuesday's outcome demonstrates that there is an internal tug of war between what Republicans know they should do \u2014 vote for Romney \u2014 and what they want to do \u2014 vote for Santorum. While we may like to think of ourselves as rational decision-makers, we are not \u2014 Republicans and Democrats alike. Our hearts weigh heavily into our decision-making tasks, especially politics. This is what is occurring among GOP primary voters. Rationally and strategically, Republicans know that Romney is the better candidate to challenge President Obama. More specifically, Republican primary voters indicate that they think the economy is the most important issue and that the best preparation for being president is a background in business. And when it comes to social issues, Romney and Santorum are indistinguishable in their opposition to gay marriage, abortion and contraception provision through insurance packages. Putting all of this into the equation, it would seem Romney is the hands-down choice. However, Romney's stand on these issues and his professional experience are being eclipsed by more emotionally laden social and cultural rhetoric. Here is where Santorum has the advantage. Emotions are responses to things that we feel passionate about. More intense emotions such as fear and anger have a greater effect on us and in turn on our behavior. And Santorum has the edge when it comes to stirring up fear and anger, ranging from his \"man-on-dog sex\" comments to saying the separation of church and state \"makes him want to vomit.\" Intense emotions can create a perceptual screen through which individuals will be less likely to deliberately weigh information. From a rational choice standpoint, Romney is likely better able to tackle pocketbook issues than Santorum. Romney is also a social conservative, but the emotional hype around Santorum overshadows Romney. This is not to say that voters' heads do not have a role to play, but what happens is that intense emotions, when not consciously checked against cognition, will win out. According to last night's exit polls, Santorum is preferred among voters who state the two most important candidate traits are conservatism and moral character. There are exceptions, such as the voters in Massachusetts and Georgia who indicate that their respective favorite sons are the conservative real deal. But beyond these exceptions, Santorum is viewed as both the truest conservative and as the candidate with the strongest moral character. Even in his wins last week in Arizona and Michigan, Romney lost out to Santorum in these two categories. In Tennessee, where Santorum won by 9 percent, Romney is still considered the most likely to defeat President Obama. While voters see Romney as the better candidate for the general election, they don't necessarily like him. The establishment recognizes this division. Just this week Congressional conservatives Representative Eric Cantor and Senator Tom Coburn urged voters to go with a leader with business and governing experience, to support Romney. And even though eighty Congressional Republicans, along with dozens of other state and local level political leaders, have endorsed Romney, primary voters are still resisting what they're being told is good for them. Of the two front-runners in the GOP field, Santorum is the emotional favorite. His brand is based on the emotionally laden issues of abortion, gay marriage and family values, but more importantly, he hams it up with theatrics. Romney has similar socially conservative views, but he has framed his campaign to emphasize the economy and his business experience. In the end, Santorum emerges as the candidate that can hit the emotional hot buttons of Republican partisans. The question now becomes, will the GOP heart or mind win, come the end of the primaries?",

She announced her resignation on Feb. 29 citing increasing partisanship in Congress. Read Another Opinion On The Decline Of Moderate Republicans In Congress George Zornick is a writer for The Nation. Maine Senator Olympia Snowe stunned the political world yesterday by announcing that she would not seek re-election this fall, despite a significant fundraising advantage and never receiving less than 60 percent of the vote in any Senate race. Snowe's decision opens a huge opportunity for Democrats to pick up a seat in a blue-ish state. In her announcement, Snowe \u2014 a noted moderate \u2014 cited the \"partisanship of recent years in the Senate\" to explain why she was suddenly throwing in the towel. Given that her staff didn't even know about her retirement until the day she announced it, I have a hunch there's something else at play here, but that's neither here nor there \u2014 the loss of a moderate, who blames nasty partisanship for her demise, is catnip for much of the Beltway press. Many of them stick rigidly to the doctrine of false balance, in which both sides of the political spectrum are always equally to blame for... everything, and that includes the recent gridlock in Congress. Snowe's retirement has given them a great opportunity to wisely tut-tut about how broken Washington has become, and say that everyone just needs to get along. Politico's Jonathan Allen published a piece that epitomizes this genre today. The article, \"The center crumbles,\" laments that \"Congress can't find the middle ground because no one's willing and able to stand there anymore.\" For some like Snowe, the question is, why bother? The prospect of running hard to win another term \u2014 particularly a six-year Senate term \u2014 is less and less attractive for folks who came to Washington to make things happen only to find out there's no common ground to get things done, only partisan point-scoring that leads to paralyzed politics. But it's harder and harder for members of Congress to get along in their own caucuses, to prevent or win primary challenges and to excite their party base in general elections if they find too much in common with the other side. What Allen's piece, and many similar analyses, fail to point out is that only one political party has become more extreme and more partisan in recent years: the GOP. Political science professor Keith Poole conducted a comprehensive study that plotted every Congressional vote from 1879 to 2011 along ideological axes, and found that around 1980, Republicans veered sharply right, with no corresponding leftward shift from Democrats. In 2011, the partisan Republican (the \"90 percent\" Republican) is almost at the limit of conservative ideology, while the partisan Democrat is much further from the leftward extreme \u2014 and has barely shifted in the past thirty years. This analysis shows what we can see to be anecdotally true every day: while the Republicans are lockstep behind privatizing Medicare, there isn't even close to Democratic consensus that Medicare should be extended to everyone. Snowe's record clearly reveals a senator fighting battles against Republican extremism. Here are the main reasons she's known as a moderate: in 2001, she forced Republicans to trim George W. Bush's tax cut package from $1.7 trillion to $1.35 trillion. She was one of only three Republicans in the Senate to vote for the stimulus plan in 2009, and one of three to vote for the Dodd-Frank financial reform bill in 2010. She supported the \"don't ask, don't tell\" repeal that same year, and earlier in her career refused to vote to impeach Bill Clinton. She also has a long record of pro-choice votes, including recent opposition to the Blunt Amendment on contraception. In each of these cases, Snowe was clearly bucking the Republican Party's social and pro-corporate extremism. But Allen doesn't explicitly note that. Instead, he provides a Democratic counter-example: that many conservative Blue Dog Democrats lost their seats in the midterm elections. He adds, \"Even the big stuff Democrats and Republicans swear they want to do \u2014 cutting the deficit, reforming Social Security and Medicare \u2014 forget it.\" You might note that \"reforming\" Social Security and Medicare are generally goals held by right and driven by business-friendly agendas. When it comes to so-called \"centrist\" Democrats as defined by the Beltway press, it's almost always people who share those goals. The Blue Dogs are motivated mainly by a pro-corporate agenda, as they oppose regulation and favor lower taxes and small government programs. (Ari Berman details the pro-corporate nature of many \"centrist\" Democrats here). Take, for example, another senator who retired recently \u2014 this time a Democrat \u2014 and blamed partisanship. Indiana Senator Evan Bayh declared, upon announcing his retirement last year, that there was \"too much partisanship and not enough progress, too much narrow ideology and not enough practical problem-solving\" in Congress. Bayh's post-retirement plans included the possibility that he might teach at a university, help a charity or \"cure a disease, or do something else worthwhile for society.\" He's since taken a heck of a detour to those noble goals. Within months of retirement from the Senate, Bayh joined a private equity firm, Apollo Global Management, along with McGuire Woods LLP, a powerful Washington lobbying group that engages on climate change and financial sector issues for \"well-heeled\" clients. He then agreed to help the US Chamber of Commerce in a public anti-regulatory push against, among other things, the Environmental Protection Agency, the Securities and Exchange Commission and the new Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. (For good measure, he also signed a contract with Fox News to provide commentary). When Republicans are deemed moderate by the Beltway press, it's generally because they buck Republican extremism, much of which ultimately serves corporate interests. Democrats are characterized as moderates when they hew close to the corporate agenda. You'll notice a common denominator here \u2014 big money and business interests are skewing the democratic process. Washington is indeed broken, and it won't be solved by Republicans and Democrats sitting next to each other at the State of the Union address.",

Like baseballs in a batting cage, the controversies that divide us just keep on coming. Fast and unpredictable. Last month it was the flap over the Susan G. Komen foundation and its move to cut financial support of Planned Parenthood. The resulting imbroglio dredged up deeply held convictions among Americans about women's health issues and \"cause marketing\" that, in this case, has resulted in profits for companies promoting breast cancer awareness and research through pink and omnipresent product tie-ins. This month it's the Girl Scouts. Bob Morris, a state representative in Indiana, has created a kerfuffle by denouncing the Girl Scouts organization for \"sexualizing young girls.\" The campfire-building, cookie-selling sorority, he wrote in a letter to his state Legislature, \"has been subverted in the name of liberal progressive politics and the destruction of traditional American family values.\" Next month it could be church bells, butterflies or baseball. There's just no telling. Do Americans disagree about everything? Are we such factious and fractious folks that we just naturally start arguing and choosing sides whenever something comes up? Are we always contentious, never content? Always warring, never loving? Have we reached such a pointed, poisoned, partisan point in our history that any topic, once it rises to the surface of national dialogue, triggers angry standoffs on Facebook and Twitter and everywhere else? In fact, there are things Americans agree about.  We will get to some of those shortly.  But, as professional mediators say about conflict resolution, before we can talk about the resolution we must first identify the conflict. And, phew, we've got an abundance of conflict in this country. 'Warring Tribes' Because we don't teach children or adults how to advocate constructively, much less how to collaboratively resolve differences, we continue to become more polarized and dysfunctional. Rhonda Hilyer, conflict resolution specialist Half of Americans, according to a recent Gallup poll, believe the country's economic system is unfair. The other half disagree. Half of Americans think the nation \"achieved its goals in Iraq,\" CNN reports. Half of Americans, the Christian Science Monitor notes, think we should attack Iran to stop its nuclear program. Half of Americans, according to a just-released USA Today poll, say President Obama \"is too liberal, and Americans are inclined to say they disagree with him on the issues that matter most to them.\" Oh, the president's favorable rating at the moment? Fifty percent, of course. Congress, like the country it represents, is also a disagreeing group. The Salt Lake Tribune describes the august body as \"warring tribes\" focused not on finding a solution to the rising national deficit but on \"placating their respective political bases and angling for re-election. ... Some days it seems that either major party would gleefully let the United States implode if it could grab a moment's political advantage over the other.\" Americans cannot agree on: When life begins and whether extreme criminals should be executed. The roles of the government and the responsibilities of the individual. The best places to live, the worst places to work, historical accuracy, futuristic predictions, who deserves better, who deserves worse and on and on. How will we ever resolve our differences? \"People tend to agree based on perceived self-interest,\" explains Rhonda Hilyer, president of Agreement Dynamics, a conflict resolution company in Seattle. \"When I work with divergent parties I help them embrace the concept of enlightened self-interest, which means that to maximize the achievement of one's self-interest, it is usually necessary to recognize the self-interest of others and to seek solutions that support all parties' interests to some extent.\" Hilyer's client list includes Boeing, Microsoft and the city of Los Angeles. When she is asked about some process that could possibly help Americans find common ground, she goes all macro. She uses two inconsonant groups of elected officials as illustration. \"For example, one group of elected officials may believe it is important to reduce the size of government by eliminating public sector jobs and lowering compensation for remaining employees,\" Hilyer says. \"Another group of electeds may oppose such cuts because they are believed to compromise public safety and will lead to a brain drain if compensation is not competitive.\" Both sides can argue that they have taken the moral high ground, \"and gridlock often results,\" Hilyer says. \"Or they can focus on a more enlightened form of self-interest by recognizing that they both want to ensure that citizens have basic public services so they are safe, can engage in commerce and transportation, be educated and skilled and afforded the rights inherent in a free society.\" Once this broad agreement is understood, she says, \"then a creative process is undertaken to determine how these interests will be met.\" Hmmm. Sounds simple enough. But, Hilyer points out, the odds are against such evenhandedness. \"Because we don't teach children or adults how to advocate constructively, much less how to collaboratively resolve differences,\" she says, \"we continue to become more polarized and dysfunctional.\" Agreeing on how to learn to agree could be a little tricky. God And Mathematics Believe it or not, there are things that all Americans agree on.  And by all Americans, we mean a vast majority \u2014 more than 90 percent. \"I would say that 90 percent plus is pretty close to full agreement, given the normal 'noise' that we find in polls, wherein there is never 100 percent agreement with anything,\" says Frank Newport, editor-in-chief of the Gallup polling firm. Here are a few areas of national accord: So God, globalism, troop support and math \u2014 these are things all Americans can agree on. \"We have several other issues on which 80 percent of Americans agree, such as, I believe, giving tax credits to manufacturers to bring back jobs from overseas,\" Newport says. And when he is asked if Gallup has found any one salient issue that really brings all Americans together, Newport says there is one: More than 90 percent of Americans believe it was right to kill Osama bin Laden.",

Jim DeMint of South Carolina, shown here speaking at the Conservative Political Action Committee in Washington, D.C., on Feb. 9, has said of this year's presidential race: \"It's not about politics.\" Politicians are notorious for sometimes saying the opposite of what they mean. That seems to be especially true when they insist an issue \"isn't about politics.\" Nowadays, politicians of all stripes seek the moral high ground by claiming something \"isn't a political issue.\" Instead, it's always \"about\" something else \u2014 jobs or education or the American people. Tougher penalties against drunken drivers in New   Mexico? \"This issue is about public safety. It's not about politics,\" according to state Rep. Tim Lewis, a Republican. Grilling Attorney General Eric Holder about the botched Fast and Furious gun operation? \"It's not about politics,\" said GOP Rep. Ted Poe of Texas. \"It's about people dying.\" Allowing insurers and employers to block coverage of birth control on religious grounds? \"This isn't a political issue,\" Republican Sen. Scott Brown of Massachusetts explained in a video released last week. \"This is about freedom to practice your religion without government interference.\" Brown is co-sponsoring an amendment that would overturn language in the federal health care law championed by President Obama. That law wasn't about politics, either \u2014 or so Obama claimed back in 2009. \"This isn't about politics,\" he said. \"This is about a health care system that is breaking America's families, breaking America's businesses and breaking America's economy.\" Whenever politicians say something isn't about politics, \"they're saying it's about politics,\" says Michael Cohen, a fellow at the Century Foundation who previously worked as a speechwriter for Democratic Sen. Christopher Dodd of Connecticut. \"It makes the opposition to your argument out to be purely political,\" Cohen says. \"It's one of those statements you use because you want to present your opponent's views as completely out of the mainstream and make them seem like everything is purely about politics.\" In these polarized times, there may be matters that rise above partisan political rancor \u2014 although, with even the Girl Scouts attracting controversy, that list may have shrunk. But aside from motherhood and apple pie, there are issues where there is, in fact, near-universal agreement \u2014 the injustice of slavery, for instance, suggests Geoffrey Nunberg, a linguist at the University of California, Berkeley. Politicians saying an issue \"isn't about politics\" are similarly trying to lift their position above the partisan fray, Nunberg says, \"depicting political issues as really matters of consensus and hence not subject to debate.\" Of course, he adds, nobody ever says something isn't political unless, in fact, they're treating it as political \u2014 by sponsoring legislation, say, which is an inherently political act. But this expression has become so common that politicians now use it even when they are talking about things that are only about politics \u2014 as when South Carolina state Sen. Tom Davis said his endorsement of Texas GOP Rep. Ron Paul for president was \"not about politics.\" The junior senator from his state, Republican Jim DeMint, suggested that this year's election itself wasn't going to be about politics. \"What we have to do as Republicans is realize it's not about politics,\" DeMint said last month on CNN. \"It's about people, it's about their family, their jobs and their future.\" Reader, remember the name of this blog \u2014 it's all politics.",

The Catholic Church in the U.S. is fighting the Obama Administration mandate on birth control. Read Another Opinion On The Contraception Mandate Tara McGuinness is Senior Vice President for the Center for American Progress Action Fund. On Friday the White House reached a compromise on the contraception mandate that can satisfy both reproductive health advocates and Catholic hospitals. For those like Rick Santorum, though, who have been loudly and repeatedly accusing the Obama administration of engaging in \"overt hostility to faith in America,\" this isn't enough. But if this is really a war against religion, maybe it's time to ask the people of faith who are supposedly under attack. People like me. My expertise on this topic is personal. Mine is a family in which priests and nuns outweigh any other profession except nurses. My mom taught nursing and medicine at a Catholic college, and placed nursing students in Catholic hospitals for 40 years. Family, faith, and taking care of people \u2014 these values are at the core of what we were taught growing up. Perhaps that is why the harsh tones, the imaginary division of the world into two camps \u2014 the faithful under attack and the attackers \u2014 seems more politics than theology. Certainly it is extremely distant from the millions of lives that could be affected by these conservative outcries. This would merely be entertaining election year political shenanigans if there were not so many lives at stake. More than 11 million women use birth control; millions more will have access to it under the new law. In fact, birth control use is nearly universal in the United States, even among Catholic women. One recent study shows that 98 percent of sexually experienced Catholic women will have used birth control at some point in their lives. Nearly 60 percent of women use birth control pills for something other than, or in addition to, contraception. For example for women at risk for ovarian cancer, taking birth control pills for five years reduces their risk of getting cancer by 50 percent. Should women have to explain to employers they need coverage for serious illnesses, not birth control, in order to obtain the medicine their doctor prescribes? Yes, there is a religious freedom question at stake, not only for employers but also employees. But much of this is already settled territory. The wide use of contraception long ago opened up the complex nature of religion in the public square and already found resolution, well before these election year political attacks. The new Department of Health and Human Services rule comes years after advances in 28 states, where regulations similar to the HHS rule have prompted religious leaders and policy makers to create solutions that serve women and their families and faith-based organizations. Take, for example, DePaul University, the nation's largest Catholic college, which has confirmed that its employee benefits include prescription birth control coverage. DePaul is not alone \u2014 the Archdiocese of New York provided contraceptive coverage for medical reasons even prior to a state law mandating it, as did Marquette University in Madison, Wisconsin, where the Diocese itself now provides coverage under Wisconsin law. I agree with the Bishops that there are cases when the religious freedom of an employer trumps that of an employee. For example, when I was a secretary at the Sacred Heart Rectory, I wouldn't expect my health care plan to include prescription contraception because I worked for the church. Under Obama's regulation, religious institutions, like the church I grew up in, are exempt.  Synagogues and other houses of worship do not have to provide contraception. Period. But when Notre Dame is the single largest employer in South  Bend, Indiana, with Saint Joseph Regional Medical  Center not far behind, how could we say, \"Sorry, you should move if you want to have affordable access to these health services.\" It is discordant with my Catholic and my American values that a receptionist at the local hospital making around $26,000 a year should have to shell out nearly $600 for birth control or cede control to her employer over when to start a family, when she is already paying in to her health care plan. The new agreement would take this difficult question off the table by allowing the women and men working at these religious affiliated organizations to receive the equal and affordable access through their insurers directly without engaging their employers. It is about time we raise the policy debate in Washington to keep up with complexity of faith, health and family that most Americans already navigate in their daily lives. Most Americans are religious. Fifty-five percent told Gallup that religion is \"very important\" to them. But these same Americans are also focused on the health of their families and they are, in fact, using birth control. Newt, Mitt, Rick, and all the other gentlemen trying to demagogue this issue would be best served listening to the folks in the pews before launching any more pious screeds. Most of America's faithful families aren't under attack from a \"war on religion.\" I for one don't feel under attack \u2014 except perhaps from a small group of Republican presidential candidates who keep ignoring the voices, values, and lives of women like me.",

Read Another Opinion On Insurance and Birth Control  John McCormack is a staff writer for The Weekly Standard. On Feb. 9, the Democratic party appeared to be in disarray over the Obama administration's decree that private insurance plans, including those offered by religious organizations, must provide free coverage of contraception, sterilization procedures, and abortifacients. At least five Democratic senators had broken ranks and publicly criticized the mandate as a violation of freedom of conscience or religious liberty. Stories of administration infighting \u2014 pitting opponents of the policy such as Vice President Joe Biden against supporters of the policy such as Health and Human Services Secretary Kahtleen Sebelius \u2014 began popping up in the press. And Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid scrambled to block a vote on a bill protecting conscience rights. But then, to the rescue, came a Friday presidential press conference, a pliant press corps, and the flat-footed hierarchy of the Catholic church.* Even before the president spoke shortly after noon on Friday, news reports indicated that Obama would \"compromise\" with or \"accommodate\" religious institutions. But Obama's announcement didn't actually change anything. \"If a woman's employer is a charity or a hospital that has a religious objection to providing contraceptive services as part of their health plan, the insurance company \u2014 not the hospital, not the charity \u2014 will be required to reach out and offer the woman contraceptive care free of charge,\" Obama said. Obama denounced the opponents of his mandate as \"cynical.\" But it's hard to imagine a more cynical gimmick than the one he had just announced. \"The White House Fact Sheet is riddled with doublespeak and contradiction,\" said New Jersey Congressman Chris Smith. \"It states, for example, that religious employers 'will not' have to pay for abortion pills, sterilization and contraception, but their 'insurance companies' will. Who pays for the insurance policy? The religious employer.\" \"It puts religious employers in the position of having to choose between providing their workers with free (to the workers) access to contraceptives and abortifacient drugs or not providing those workers with health insurance at all (and also paying a large fine),\" Yuval Levin wrote at National Review Online. Planned Parenthood rejoiced, agreeing with conservatives that the new policy didn't change much of anything. A number of liberal Catholics who had supported Obamacare also rejoiced, saying Obama's proposal changed everything. They had been humiliated by the administration's forthright trampling of religious freedom and were pathetically happy to grab the fig leaf being offered. The Catholic hierarchy responded diplomatically and cautiously. \"While there may be an openness to respond to some of our concerns, we reserve judgment on the details until we have them,\" said Cardinal-designate Timothy Dolan, the head of the United States Council of Catholic Bishops. He added that Obama's proposal was \"a first step in the right direction.\" The Catholic church is not known for being nimble or combative. Perhaps Dolan needed to confer with hundreds of other bishops in the country before making a stronger pronouncement. But the weak statement was a missed opportunity nonetheless. The White House is not on the verge of protecting rights of conscience for those who run religious charities, hospitals, and universities. And even if it were, is the church's only goal creating a pristine Catholic ghetto in which only its religious institutions are free to exercise the rights of conscience? What about the consciences of, say, millions of pro-life businessowners? Should they be required by an executive ruling to pay for abortifacients or face heavy fines? No, now is not the time to go easy on Obamacare. It's important to remember that the law was structured so that its most popular elements are introduced first. The current mandate was specifically designed by the Obama administration to be a campaign issue \u2014 it takes effect August 2012, just three months before the election. Now is the time to warn the country that Obamacare is about to get much worse. When its health care exchanges are up and running in 2014, Obamacare will fund taxpayer-subsidized abortions. If the law stands, millions of Americans will lose their employer-provided health insurance and be dumped into the government-regulated health care exchanges. Whether Obamacare is putting the government between you and your God or putting government between you and your doctor, it is an unjust law. And that's to say nothing of the fact it will rapidly worsen our nation's engulfing debt crisis. But it will be too late to wait until 2013 or 2014 to speak up forcefully about any of these things. The fate of Obamacare will be decided in November 2012.",

            "article_content": "The conflict between the Catholic Bishops and the White House over contraceptive coverage has American Catholics choosing sides. Catholics narrowly support the White House position in polls. There are potential political consequences: In presidential elections, Catholics are swing voters. They supported Al Gore in 2000, President George W. Bush in '04 and President Obama in '08. The GOP presidential hopefuls are certainly using this issue. Framing it as a question of religious freedom is a guaranteed way to fire up the conservative base. \"If you believe in the right to worship God without government interfering, come join us,\" former House Speaker Newt Gingrich said. Mitt Romney vowed: \"This kind of assault on religion will end if I'm president of the United States.\" And Rick Santorum added: \"What they've done is an egregious affront to religious liberty.\" Mandate 'Beyond Politics' In the audience at that Santorum event in Rochester,  Minn., was Charles Slater, a family physician who agrees with the candidate. \"I think a lot of people don't understand or see that that's a principle that people of Catholic faith are being asked to violate,\" he said.  \"So the mandate from the government goes beyond politics. It goes down to the very center of theology, Catholic theology, or teaching about the human person.\" But not all Catholics share that view when it comes to birth control. In fact, 98 percent of Catholic women use birth control at some point in their lifetimes. A new survey by Public Policy Polling shows that a narrow majority of Catholic voters think women employed by Catholic hospitals and universities should have access to contraceptive coverage through their health plans. Among them is Pat Schaffer in Minneapolis, who says Catholic institutions are not being asked to supply birth control themselves, only to include such coverage in health care plans. \"If the employee agrees with them, then they won't use the contraception,\" she says. \"And if the employees in conscience disagree with the bishops, then it's up to the employees what to do, and I don't see how the bishops have the right to force the employee to take a particular stand any more than they have the right to control how an employee uses their wages.\" Seeking Exceptions Across the river in St. Paul, students at University  of St. Thomas have been talking about this issue in classrooms and over lunch at the student services building. \"I believe it's the Amish [who] have the option to opt out of the draft, and the Quakers have the option, too,\" said Katie Moosbrugger, a Catholic studies, German and education major. \"There are lots of exceptions for religious institutions ... and Catholics, we don't hold that contraception is something to be supported.\" Hanna Heinicke, also a student at St. Thomas, acknowledges that it's complicated but says she has to \"err on the side of the bishops.\" \"I think it's not fair that religious organizations would have to provide services that they feel are morally wrong,\" she says. But Heinicke supports the overall health care bill signed by Obama in 2010. \"I'm actually a huge fan of it,\" she says. \"I think everyone should have the right to have health care. I think it's a human right.\" In Washington on Thursday, a group of women backing the White House rule on the issue held an event at the National Press Club. Their concern, amid all of the debate, is that the president stick to his guns. \"I have faith in him that he will do the right thing. I will be praying that he does the right thing,\" said Callie Otto, a student at Catholic University of America. \"But I will also be praying that the bishops can realize that they're wrong and they back down so he doesn't have so much pressure.\" Catholics on each side of this are offering prayers. For its part, the Obama administration is looking for an answer that allows it to defend its decision and also somehow address the concerns of its opponents.",

Last is a senior writer at The Weekly Standard. On the last weekend of January, priests in Catholic churches across America read extraordinary letters to their congregations. The missives informed the laity that President Obama and his administration had launched an assault on the church. In Virginia, Catholics heard from Bishop Paul Loverde, who wrote, \"I am absolutely convinced that an unprecedented and very dangerous line has been crossed.\" In Phoenix, Bishop Thomas Olmsted wrote, \"We cannot\u200b \u2014 \u200bwe will not\u200b \u2014 \u200bcomply with this unjust law.\" In Pittsburgh, Bishop David Zubik wrote that President Obama had told Catholics, \"To Hell with your religious beliefs.\" Bishop Daniel Jenky of Peoria asked his flock to join him in the Prayer to St. Michael the Archangel, which concludes: By the Divine Power of God / cast into Hell, Satan and all the evil spirits / who prowl about the world seeking the ruin of souls. It was a remarkable moment, in part because despite their stern reputation, most Catholic bishops are not terribly conservative. They tend to be politically liberal and socially cautious. If they were less holy men, stauncher conservatives would call them squishes. Real live conservative bishops are so few and far between that whenever one appears on the scene, such as Philadelphia's Archbishop Charles Chaput, he's seen as a vaguely threatening curiosity. You can tell when a bishop is conservative because you will hear him referred to as \"hardline\" or \"ultra-orthodox,\" so as to mark him apart from the rest of the herd. But what made the moment even more remarkable is that the bishops were not exaggerating. It is now a requirement of Obamacare that every Catholic institution larger than a single church\u200b \u2014 and even including some single churches\u200b \u2014 \u200bmust pay for contraceptives, sterilization, and morning-after abortifacients for its employees. Each of these is directly contrary to the Catholic faith. But the Obama administration does not care. They have said, in effect, Do what we tell you \u2014 or else. The beginnings of this confrontation lay in an obscure provision of Obama's Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, which stated that all insurers will be required to provide \"preventive health services.\" When the law was passed, \"preventive\" was not defined but left to be determined at a later date. This past August, Health and Human Services secretary Kathleen Sebelius finally got around to explaining the administration's interpretation of the phrase. Based on a recommendation from the Institute  of Medicine, the administration would define \"preventive health services\" to include contraceptives, morning-after pills, and female sterilization. And they would interpret the \"all insurers\" section to include religious organizations, whatever their beliefs. Sebelius included one small conscience exemption: A religious employer who objects to medical treatment aimed at prevention of the disease commonly known as \"pregnancy\" may leave it out of their health insurance coverage provided the employer satisfies three criteria: (1) It has religious inculcation as its primary duty; (2) It primarily employs people of the same faith; and (3) It primarily serves people of the same faith. This fig leaf is enough to cover most small churches\u200b \u2014 \u200bso long as your parish employs only a couple of priests and a secretary, it would probably get a pass. Larger institutions would not. In the Catholic world, for instance, a diocesan office often employs lots of people\u200b \u2014 \u200blawyers, janitors, administrative staff\u200b \u2014 \u200bwho are not necessarily Catholic. And the duties of such offices extend far beyond inculcation of the faith\u200b \u2014 \u200bto include charity, community service, and education. Or take Catholic universities. There are more than 200 of them, serving some 750,000 students. They clearly do not fit the exemption. Neither would any of the 6,980 Catholic elementary or secondary schools. Nor the country's 600 Catholic hospitals; nor its 1,400 Catholic long-term care centers. Ditto the network of Catholic social services organizations that spend billions of dollars a year to serve the needy and disadvantaged. As soon as Sebelius released this decision, the Catholic church panicked. The Conference of Catholic Bishops reached out to the administration to explain the position in which it had put them. But the tone of their concern was largely friendly: Most Catholic leaders were convinced that the entire thing was a misunderstanding and that the policy\u200b \u2014 \u200bwhich was labeled an \"interim\" measure\u200b \u2014 \u200bwould eventually be amended. The reason for this optimism was that more than a few important Catholics had previously climbed out on a high branch for Obama politically, and for his health care reform as a matter of policy. Despite what you may read in the New York Times, most lay Catholics are nominally at home in the Democratic party. (Remember that a majority of Catholics voted for Obama in 2008.) And what is true of the laity goes double for those in religious life. In 2009, Notre Dame president Father John Jenkins welcomed President Obama as the school's commencement speaker in the face of a heated student protest. The U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops mostly kept its powder dry during the fight over Obamacare, and very few members of the church hierarchy actively, or even tacitly, opposed the bill. Others, such as Sister Carol Keehan, the president of the Catholic Health Association, actually lobbied in favor of it, early and often. So most Catholics took the president at his word when he met with Archbishop Timothy Dolan last fall and assured him that when the final version of the policy was eventually released, any fears would be allayed. That was their mistake. Obama telephoned Dolan on the morning of January 20 to inform him that the only concession he intended to offer in the final policy was to extend the deadline for conformity to August 2013. Every other aspect of the policy enunciated by Sebelius would remain rigidly in place. It's unclear whether Obama anticipated the blowback which resulted from this announcement, or perhaps even welcomed the fight. The liberal Catholic establishment nearly exploded. Sister Keehan was so horrified she threw her lot in with the more conservative Dolan in full-throated opposition to Obama. Cardinal Roger Mahony, the spectacularly liberal archbishop emeritus of Los Angeles, wrote, \"I cannot imagine a more direct and frontal attack on freedom of conscience... This decision must be fought against with all the energies the Catholic community can muster.\" Michael Sean Winters, the National Catholic Reporter's leftist lion, penned a 1,800-word cri de coeur titled \"J'accuse!\" in which he declared that, as God was his witness, he would never again vote for Obama. The editors of the Jesuit magazine America denounced a \"wrong decision,\" while the Washington Post columnist E. J. Dionne called the policy \"unconscionable.\" When you've lost even E.J. and the Jesuits, you've lost the church. The reason liberal Catholics were so wounded is twofold. First, this isn't a religio-cultural fight over Latin in the Mass or Gregorian chant. The subjects of contraception, abortion, and sterilization are not ornamental aspects of the Catholic faith; they flow from the Church's central teachings about the dignity of the human person. Second, Obama has left Catholic organizations a very narrow set of options. (1) They may truckle to the government's mandate, in violation of their beliefs. (2) They may cease providing health insurance to their employees altogether, though this would incur significant financial penalties under Obamacare. (The church seems unlikely to obtain any of Nancy Pelosi's golden waivers.) Or (3) they may simply shut down. There is precedent for this final option. In 2006, Boston's Catholic Charities closed its adoption service\u200b \u2014 \u200bone of the most successful in the nation\u200b \u2014 \u200bafter Massachusetts law required that the organization must place children in same-sex households. Which means that what is actually on the block are precisely the kind of social-justice services\u200b \u2014 \u200beducation, health care, and aid to the needy\u200b \u2014 \u200bthat liberal Catholics believe to be the most vital works of the church. For conservative Catholics, Obama merely confirmed their darkest suspicions; for liberals, it was a betrayal in full. As a matter of law, this decision by Obama's health care bureaucrats seems unlikely to survive. Last month, the Supreme Court struck down another attempt by the administration to bully religious believers in the Hosanna-Tabor case. In that instance, Obama's Equal Employment Opportunity Commission argued that a religious organization does not have the right to control its hiring and firing according to its religious belief. The Court struck down this argument 9-0 in a rebuke so embarrassing that Justice Elena Kagan came close to openly mocking her successor as Obama's solicitor general during oral arguments. It was the kind of sweeping decision that should have deterred the Obama administration from forcing Catholics into complying with the health insurance mandate, because it suggested that the Court will very likely side against the administration once this matter comes before it. Presidents typically dislike being overturned unanimously by the High Court. The trick, of course, is that when Sebelius issued the final protocol, her lone concession was the one-year delay in implementation. Which, for Obama, has the happy side-effect of pushing the moment of enforcement to August 2013. Meaning that no legal challenge can come until after the 2012 election. Which suggests that the thinking behind the policy may be primarily political. The question, then, is whether Obama's confrontation with Catholics makes electoral sense. While Catholics were blindsided by the January decision, the left had been paying close attention to the subject for months. In November, several leftist and feminist blogs began beating the war drums, warning Obama not to \"cave\" (their word) to the bishops. They were joined by the Nation, Salon, the Huffington Post, and the usual suspects. (Sample headline: \"The Men Behind the War on Women.\") At the same time, Planned Parenthood and NARAL launched grassroots lobbying efforts and delivered petitions with 100,000 and 135,000 signatures respectively to the White House urging Obama to uphold the policy and not compromise. In that sense, Obama's decision might be thought of as akin to his decision halting the Keystone oil pipeline: a conscious attempt to energize his base at the expense of swing voters, who he concluded were already lost. The other possibility, of course, is that Obama sees the dismantling of Catholic institutions as part of a larger ideological mission, worth losing votes over. As Yuval Levin noted in National Review Online last week, institutions such as the Catholic church represent a mediating layer between the individual and the state. This layer, known as civil society, is one of the principal differences between Western liberal order and the socialist view. Levin argues that the current fight is just one more example of President Obama's attempt to bulldoze civil society. He wants to sweep away the middle layer so that individuals may have a more direct and personal encounter with the state. The attack on Catholics is, Levin concludes, \"an attack on mediating institutions of all sorts, moved by the genuine belief that they are obstacles to a good society.\" Seen in this light, Obama's confrontation with the Catholic church is of a piece with the administration's pursuit of the rickety Hosanna-Tabor case and another incident from last October, when the Department of Health and Human Services defunded a grant to the Conference of Catholic Bishops. That program supported aid to victims of human trafficking. The Obama administration decided that they no longer wanted the Catholic church in the business of helping these poor souls. That, evidently, is the government's job. Of course, there is a third possibility in explaining the president's motives. It could be that, in deciding to go to war with the Catholic church, President Obama has hit on one of those rare moments where his electoral interests \u2014 at least as he perceives them \u2014 and his ideological goals are blessedly aligned.",

Wade Supreme Court decision that legalized abortion. Anti-abortion groups plan to push several bills this year that would restrict abortions. \n                \n                    \n                    Brendan Hoffman/Getty Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption Last year was a pivotal one for abortion laws. Dozens of restrictions were passed in the states \u2014 nearly a  record since the Supreme Court's 1973 Roe v. Wade decision, which  legalized abortion. This year, anti-abortion groups say they'll focus on passing more restrictions, and on a state-by-state campaign to grant constitutional rights to embryos. The anti-abortion strategy this year is to pass bills that would ban abortions earlier, and to change the legal definition of personhood \u2014 an effort that would outlaw abortions. Among our top priorities this year is to continue to ensure Planned Parenthood is not receiving government funds, to pass clinic regulations that will ensure the health and safety of women, and also to ensure that insurance plans do not cover abortion. Kellie Fiedorek, Americans United for Life Last month, the National Right to Life Committee announced it would push bills to prohibit abortions at 20 weeks, based on the assumption that fetuses can feel pain. Five states have passed this law. Mary Spaulding Balch, state legislation director for the group, says that's just the beginning. \"No serious challenge, no serious legal challenge, has been mounted to any of these state laws to date,\" she says. \"And we know that these laws work.\" A version of the fetal pain bill was just introduced in Congress targeting the District of Columbia. Other bills would ban private insurance companies from covering abortions, and restrict federal and state funding to any abortion provider. That's a key goal of Americans United for Life. Kellie Fiedorek is an attorney with the anti-abortion group. \"Among our top priorities this year is to continue to ensure Planned Parenthood is not receiving government funds, to pass clinic regulations that will ensure the health and safety of women, and also to ensure that insurance plans do not cover abortion,\" she says. Fiedorek says the 2010 midterm elections ushered in new conservative GOP lawmakers, and that led to the passage of more abortion restrictions \u2014 a trend she says is likely to persist. \"In 2011, we saw 47 states consider more than 460 measures related to abortion. We saw 70 laws enacted,\" Fiedorek says. \"And I would expect continuing progress in 2012.\" The Center for Reproductive Rights is fighting many of these measures in court, including laws in Texas and North Carolina that require doctors to show women ultrasounds and provide a detailed description of the fetus. Nancy Northup is the group's president. \"In 2012, we will fight back relentlessly in the courts,\" she says. \"And in the lawsuits that we have brought against the anti-choice assaults, we will be and are developing new legal theories that will get stronger protection from the courts.\" So far, the courts have been split in rulings on abortion laws. The Center for Reproductive Rights is also battling efforts to increase clinic regulations. Abortion opponents say they will make clinics safer \u2014 but Northup says they're unnecessary. In 2012, we will fight back relentlessly in the courts. And in the lawsuits that we have brought against the anti-choice assaults, we will be and are developing new legal theories that will get stronger protection from the courts. Nancy Northup, Center for Reproductive Rights \"What you see is this attempt to both reduce the number of providers by regulating them out of practice, and cutting off funding for insurance,\" she says. \"And those are the kind of restrictions that have a big impact, and those are the kind that we're concerned about.\" And there's another strategy that worries abortion-rights activists \u2014 the \"personhood\" campaign. It's a state-by-state effort to pass a constitutional amendment that would expand the definition of a person and grant legal rights to embryos. Last month, the president of Personhood USA, Keith Mason, spoke at the group's forum for GOP presidential hopefuls in South Carolina. \"I would say this is an historic event because the most important issue in this race, in all of the races, is that of human life,\" Mason says. Personhood initiatives could appear on the ballot in more than half a dozen states. They would ban all abortions and some methods of birth control. Eleanor Smeal is with the Feminist Majority Foundation, which is fighting the effort. \"The personhood amendments provide a big challenge to us, because there are so many circulating,\" Smeal says. \"They are circulating them in some of the most important battleground states such as Colorado, Ohio and Nevada.\" Voters in Colorado and Mississippi have already rejected personhood initiatives, and not all anti-abortion groups endorse the strategy. But they are a way to redefine the political debate over the issue, and could provide a direct challenge to the U.S. Supreme Court decision that legalized abortion.",

If it seemed like 2011 was a big year for laws restricting abortion, it was. In fact, according to \"Who Decides? The Status of Women's Reproductive Rights In the U.S.,\" the 21st annual report compiled by the abortion-rights group NARAL Pro-Choice America, the 69 laws enacted restricting a woman's reproductive rights were just one short of the record set in 1999. \"The bottom line here is that elections matter,\" said NARAL President and CEO Nancy Keenan. \"When you have a change of anti-choice politicians sitting in the statehouse, it affects women's' lives.\" In fact, the dramatic increase in laws restricting abortion and other reproductive health matters shouldn't have come as much of a surprise given the results of the 2010 elections, noted NARAL Policy Director Donna Crane. After the sweeping success of the Tea Party, only six states have governments where both houses of the legislature and the governor support abortion rights, while 19 states have a governor and majority of the legislature opposed to abortion. The states that passed the largest number of abortion restrictions in 2011 all got new, anti-abortion GOP governors in 2009 or 2010: Florida, Arizona and Kansas. Interestingly, however, those states don't match the list of the top \"pro-life\" states as ranked today by the anti-abortion group Americans United for Life. AUL, which ranked states not just according to anti-abortion legislation but also issues including euthanasia, cloning and stem-cell research, put Louisiana, Oklahoma, and Pennsylvania at the top of its list. Bringing up the rear were Hawaii, California and Washington. Meanwhile, the NARAL report shows that the 69 anti-abortion laws fell broadly into five separate categories. 1. Mandatory ultrasound laws. These laws, now passed by eight states, require a physician to perform an ultrasound on a pregnant women before performing an abortion, even if it is not medically indicated and the woman does not request it. 2. Abortion insurance coverage bans. These laws, now passed by 16 states, ban abortion coverage by private health insurers. Some apply to all health insurers in a state, some to the new health \"exchanges\" that will be created by the Affordable Care Act. 3. Nebraska copycat bans. In 2010, Nebraska banned most abortions after 20 weeks gestation, on the contested theory that it marks the point in pregnancy when a fetus can feel pain. So far at least five more states \u2014 Idaho, Indiana, Kansas, Oklahoma, and Alabama \u2014 have joined Nebraska in enacting similar laws. 4. Race and sex selection laws. These are laws that make it a crime for physicians to fail to ensure that abortions are not being done purely for race or gender selection reasons. Arizona passed such a law in March 2011, joining three other states that had older laws already on the books. 5. Affiliation bans. These laws seek to bar abortion providers (often, but not exclusively Planned Parenthood) from receiving state funds for family planning or other services. Three states passed new laws in 2011, bringing to 11 the number of states with such laws in place, although four are currently being blocked by court order. And action is already heating up for 2012, say both sides. Several states are looking at \"personhood\" ballot amendments, which define life as beginning at fertilization. Such laws would not only ban all abortions with no exception, but also many forms of birth control. Meanwhile, the Ohio Senate is expected to move early this year on a bill to ban abortion at the point the fetal heartbeat can be detected \u2013 about eight weeks into pregnancy. The bill passed the Ohio House last year. That bill \"would outlaw abortion at a point in pregnancy when most women aren't even aware they're pregnant,\" said Kellie Copeland, executive director of NARAL Pro-Choice Ohio. And it would almost certainly prompt a challenge to the Supreme Court's landmark Roe v. Wade decision legalizing abortion. That decision marks its 39th anniversary this Sunday.",

            "article_content": "The Indiana GOP now has a stranglehold on state government, with supermajorities in both chambers of its General Assembly and conservative Republican Mike Pence headed to the governor's mansion. But Republican lawmakers are preaching caution and a need for increased bipartisanship as they handle unchecked legislative power for the next two years. Will they be able to resist the urge to shove through their agenda?  DAVID GREENE, HOST: In so many ways our country seems politically divided. Nevertheless, last month's election left 11 states controlled by supermajorities, meaning one party occupies the governor's mansion and owns the overwhelming majority in the legislature. Let's get a sense for the dynamic in one of these states - Indiana. Republicans seem in command. And yet despite their new leverage, Indiana's Republican lawmakers are preaching caution and a need for increased bipartisanship. Indiana Public Broadcasting's Brandon Smith reports. BRANDON SMITH, BYLINE: During the last two legislative sessions, Democrats here employed walkouts to block or delay passage of controversial legislation in the Republican-controlled Indiana House. But now that tactic will no longer work. With Republicans controlling 69 seats in the chamber, they have more than the two-thirds necessary to prevent any such effort. STATE REPRESENTATIVE BRIAN BOSMA: I want to meet with her very soon. So... SMITH: Speaking with legislators and their families at a gathering following the first official day of the new session, House Speaker Brian Bosma stands out. At six-foot-four, he's physically imposing and he's been his party's leader in the House for a dozen years and says he won't run roughshod over the Democrats. BOSMA: Someone might step into the role and say, yeah, now's my chance. But I've been here long enough and been in the minority most of that tenure to understand that everyone is elected independently to participate in the process here, so we will work with those who are willing. SMITH: But Bosma's caucus is bigger than any the Republicans have had in 40 years. Longtime Hoosier political analyst Ed Feigenbaum says when Republicans gained a supermajority back in 1972, they lost it only two years later because of outside political forces. ED FEIGENBAUM: 1972 was the Nixon landslide and 1974 was the reaction to Watergate. SMITH: Feigenbaum says the new supermajority is built largely on the state's shifting demographics and redrawn districts. But he's not sure that will make holding onto the supermajority any easier. FEIGENBAUM: When you're dealing with more than 60 races, you know, of which maybe 45 may be truly potentially competitive, that's a lot of money to have to raise in order to defend all of those seats. SMITH: Still, until those elections come around again in two years, you could argue that Democrats in the legislature might be functionally irrelevant. But House Minority Leader Scott Pelath argues just the opposite. He says because of the numbers, Republicans may need to reach out to Democrats even more than in the past. STATE REPRESENTATIVE SCOTT PELATH: I think Speaker Bosma, if he doesn't already know it, realizes he's going to have some of his own divisions within his own caucus. Just because there's a lot of members from one particular party doesn't mean they don't have some intense disagreements. SMITH: There's one legislator here in the House who remembers what it was like to be in a superminority. South Bend Democrat Pat Bauer says despite the appearance of having no power, the minority can still effect change. STATE REPRESENTATIVE PAT BAUER: You offer your ideas on the floor, you offer them at committee, you repeat it in the Senate if you can, and just get the people to know. SMITH: So even with supermajorities in both houses, it isn't expected that there will be a lot of controversial legislative proposals. That's in part because over the past two years, Republicans have already passed a Right to Work bill, massive education reform measures, and legislation halting funding to Planned Parenthood. They might fear that pushing the same kind of extreme proposals would just make their supermajority short-lived. For NPR News, I'm Brandon Smith in Indianapolis. Copyright \u00a9 2012 NPR.

            "article_content": "Both the White House and a number of female senators are pushing for a reauthorization of the Violence Against Women Act, which is set to expire this year.  MELISSA BLOCK, HOST: This is ALL THINGS CONSIDERED from NPR News. I'm Melissa Block. AUDIE CORNISH, HOST: And I'm Audie Cornish. Another political fight is brewing in Congress, this time about a law that was once considered truly bipartisan. The Violence Against Women Act first passed during the Clinton administration and has been steadily re-authorized since. But NPR's Andrea Seabrook reports that election year politics are making it more difficult this time around. ANDREA SEABROOK, BYLINE: Let's be clear. Just about everyone says they support the Violence Against Women Act. It funds programs and shelters that help victims of domestic abuse, rape and assault. Here's the problem though - in the Senate, the newest version of the act, which was written by Democrats, adds three things that Republicans don't like. One, it gives Indian tribal governments new powers to prosecute crimes against women. Two, it increases the ability of undocumented immigrants to report violence against themselves without fear of deportation. And three, for shelters and programs that receive this money, it bans discrimination based on sexual orientation or gender identity. SENATOR CHUCK GRASSLEY: The provision is a solution in search of a problem. SEABROOK: Senator Chuck Grassley, a Republican from Iowa. He outlined his party's problems with the bill at a hearing. And he said women's groups haven't brought forward any evidence of discrimination in those programs. GRASSLEY: It is only a political statement that shouldn't be made on a bill that is designed to address actual needs of victims. SEABROOK: Now, Senator Patrick Leahy, the Democrat who helped write the bill, was incredulous that the GOP would oppose any measure that tries to increase the number of women the act helps. SENATOR PATRICK LEAHY: Don't pick and choose among victims. They all count. All victims deserve protection. SEABROOK: There is real political peril here for Republicans, after a particular series of events in the spring. There was legislation to let businesses deny insurance coverage of birth control. There was the panel of all-men talking about it. And there were the now-infamous quotes from Rush Limbaugh debasing a female law student. These and other events led left-leaning political groups to charge Republicans with having a war on women. (SOUNDBITE OF A POLITICAL AD) UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN: Judging from their comments, the GOP must have a serious problem with women. SEABROOK: This ad is from MoveOn.org and Republicans say its proof that Democrats are just hurling election year insults at them. But if they block the Violence Against Women Act, even some Republicans acknowledge they risk playing right into the Democrats' narrative. Andrea Seabrook, NPR News, the Capitol.

            "article_content": "Democrats are trying to use GOP Rep. Todd Akin's comments about rape and abortion to influence the presidential race and other contests across the country. Mitt Romney does not want to spend his time talking about Akin, but events have forced him.  STEVE INSKEEP, HOST: It's MORNING EDITION from NPR News. I'm Steve Inskeep. By now, people across the nation have heard remarks by Missouri Republican Todd Akin. He says he misspoke about pregnancy and rape, but his words shifted the polls in his race for a vital U.S. Senate seat. Now Democrats want to be sure the remarks have a national effect. Here's NPR's Ari Shapiro. ARI SHAPIRO, BYLINE: All year long, Democrats have accused Republicans of a war on women. It's been fought over contraception, equal pay, anything that Democrats think could keep women's votes in the blue column. Congressman Todd Akins's reference to \"legitimate rape\" gave President Obama a new weapon. PRESIDENT BARACK OBAMA: I think the underlying notion that we should be making decisions on behalf of women for their health care decisions, or qualifying forcible rape versus non-forcible rape, I think those are broader issues and that is a significant difference in approach between me and the other party. SHAPIRO: That was Monday. On Wednesday, the president brought up Akin again at a fundraiser in New York. He said: This is an individual who sits on the House Committee on Science and Technology but somehow missed science class. Mitt Romney doesn't want to spend his time talking about this, but events have forced him. He told a New Hampshire TV station... (SOUNDBITE OF TV BROADCAST) INSKEEP: Obama campaign spokeswoman Jen Psaki says it's no profile in courage to condemn the phrase \"legitimate rape.\" This week, she pointed out, Republicans put a line into the party platform opposing abortion in the case of rape or incest. And further, she said aboard Air Force One... JEN PSAKI: Paul Ryan worked with Todd Akin on legislation in Congress that would redefine what rape is. SHAPIRO: She's referring to proposed legislation that included the phrase \"forcible rape.\" Paul Ryan tried to distance himself from that language in an interview with a local CBS station in Pittsburgh. (SOUNDBITE OF TV BROADCAST) SHAPIRO: Ryan emphasized that a President Romney would set an administration's position on abortion. Romney says women should be allowed to have an abortion in the case of rape or incest. Ryan personally opposes those exceptions. But Romney's stance on abortion has shifted over the years. This week, the L.A. Times reported that in the 2008 presidential campaign, Romney touted the support of the doctor behind Akin's theory that raped women don't get pregnant. Romney called that doctor an important surrogate for his campaign four years ago. Since that detail of the story emerged, the Romney campaign has only agreed to local interviews under the condition that reporters agree not to ask about Akin or abortion. ED ROGERS: It's a distraction, and we don't need any distractions, especially the week before our own convention. SHAPIRO: Republican consultant Ed Rogers says this controversy is a gift to Democrats and an albatross for Romney. ROGERS: It's cost him days when he could be having a message about something else, particularly about the economy, and instead of having a message about that, we're talking about one of the wackiest things said in American politics this year, and that's saying something. SHAPIRO: The ultimate question is whether this will drive votes. Debbie Walsh directs the Center for American Women and Politics at Rutgers. She says women tend to vote on economic issues, but this debate could be different if it seems especially regressive. DEBBIE WALSH: It's getting into some issues that I think for a lot of women were settled long ago, and so I think it has the potential to engage them more in the process and I think that on the Democratic side, that has been something that has been lacking. SHAPIRO: She's talking about the enthusiasm gap that has favored Republicans in this election. Democrats hope that Akins's comments will add some much-needed fuel to their party's fire.

            "article_content": "President Obama spoke to a bipartisan crowd at the National Prayer Breakfast Thursday and cited the biblical injunction to speak up for those who are destitute.  MELISSA BLOCK, HOST: President Obama also weighed in today on America's obligation to the poor. Speaking at the National Prayer Breakfast, the president cited the biblical injunction to care for the least among us and to speak up for those who are destitute. He said his policy choices are often guided by his Christian faith, and he appealed for tolerance of those with differing views. As NPR's Scott Horsley reports, the administration is currently at odds with the Catholic Church over a controversial policy concerning birth control. UNIDENTIFIED GROUP: (Singing) Amazing grace... SCOTT HORSLEY, BYLINE: The National Prayer Breakfast is an annual tradition in Washington, a bipartisan chance for policymakers who may have been acting like children to spend at least one morning acting like God's children. President Obama has been a regular at the breakfast since his Senate days. He's often used the opportunity to talk about his faith. We can't leave our values at the door, he said today, treating others as you want to be treated, living by the principle that we are our brother's keeper and caring for the poor and those in need. PRESIDENT BARACK OBAMA: These values are old. They can be found in many denominations and many faiths, among many believers and among many nonbelievers, and they're values that have always made this country great when we live up to them. HORSLEY: The White House says Mr. Obama was not campaigning against Mitt Romney or anyone else, but he was more explicit today than in the past about connecting his faith to specific policy measures, including health care and Wall Street regulation and his push for higher taxes on the wealthy. OBAMA: As a Christian, it also coincides with Jesus's teaching that for unto whom much is given, much shall be required. HORSLEY: Mr. Obama says he's often prayed for guidance in his role as president. At the same time, he was careful to say Christianity does not come with a detailed political program. OBAMA: It is God who is infallible, not us. Michelle reminds me of this often. (SOUNDBITE OF LAUGHTER) OBAMA: So instead, it is our hope that people of goodwill can pursue their values and common ground and the common good as best they know how. HORSLEY: Mr. Obama has long stressed the importance of respect towards those with differing religious views, which is why some supporters are surprised and angry about a new administration health care policy that requires most employer insurance plans to cover birth control at no cost. The policy includes a narrow exception for churches with a religious objection of birth control but not, for example, big Catholic hospitals or universities. Spokeswoman Mary Ann Walsh of the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops says that's a violation of conscience. SISTER MARY ANN WALSH: The Catholic Church \u2013 it's no secret - does not believe in artificial means of contraception. And here, you're saying, well, you have to pay for them. Not only we don't care that you don't believe it, you had to pay for something that you don't believe in. HORSLEY: The White House insists it's trying to strike a balance between respecting religious views while also making birth control accessible. It notes the vast majority of women, including 98 percent of Catholic women, use birth control during their lifetime. Political scientist John Green, who studies religion and politics at the University of Akron, says it's not clear how lay Catholics will react to this controversy, but he knows white Catholics in particular carry a lot of weight in battleground states, like Ohio and Pennsylvania. DR. JOHN GREEN: Many of them swing back and forth from election to election. So if this controversy were to develop into strong antipathy among white Catholics to the administration, then that could pose a serious problem for the president at the ballot box. HORSLEY: A White House spokesman said today he doesn't know if Mr. Obama prayed over the birth control policy, but some critics are urging the president to give that policy another look.

Over the weekend Mitt Romney scored a huge victory in the Nevada caucuses, besting his closest rival Newt Gingrich by double digits. As the Republicans battle it out, President Obama got some positive news on the economic front last week, and is seeing his polling numbers improve.  STEVE INSKEEP, HOST: It's MORNING EDITION, from NPR News. I'm Steve Inskeep. RENEE MONTAGNE, HOST: And I'm Renee Montagne. The Republican presidential primary season heads into another phase this week, as Colorado and Minnesota voters choose their candidates tomorrow. Over the weekend, Mitt Romney scored a huge victory in the Nevada caucuses, besting his closest rival, Newt Gingrich, by double digits. As the Republicans battle it out, President Obama got some positive news on the economy last week and is seeing his polling numbers improve. But there are some other dangers lurking for him. For more on where this election season stands, we're joined - as we are most Mondays - by NPR's Cokie Roberts. Good morning. COKIE ROBERTS, BYLINE: Hi, Renee. MONTAGNE: Hello. So, Saturday night in Nevada, the few thousand folks who went to caucuses went for Romney big time. Does that really signify anything? ROBERTS: Yes, because all kinds of Republicans went for him - very conservative Republicans, self-identified; Tea Party Republicans. Also, it was a state in another part of the country from where he's won earlier this year. Now, it did have a huge - almost a quarter of those caucus-goers were Mormons. But it builds Romney's momentum after his big win in Florida last week - to move west and do well. It gets harder and harder for his opponents to hang in. Now, they vow they will, and Newt Gingrich is on the attack. I mean, he is really going after Romney. Rick Santorum hopes for a good showing in Minnesota tomorrow and later, in Missouri. And Ron Paul is convinced that Romney could self-destruct. And, of course, he's given them reason to believe he might. He keeps putting his foot in his mouth; saying things like, I'm not really concerned about poor people. But I think you're not going to be seeing too many interviews or press conferences. I think he's going to be very scripted from here on out. MONTAGNE: So let's turn to the Obama side of this campaign season. On Friday, we learned the unemployment rate last month fell to 8.3 percent - which was good news for the president. If you combine this news with the bitterness that you've just been talking about, in the Republican fight, does Mr. Obama seem in a safer position than he did even a few months ago? ROBERTS: Yes. There's a new poll out this morning, from ABC News and the Washington Post, showing that the president has hit what for an incumbent, is a crucial mark of a 50 percent approval rating. He's been below that for many months. And part of that does seem to be that voters are unhappy about the Republican candidates fighting each other. The president told NBC's Matt Lauer, in a pre-Super Bowl interview, that the job-creation numbers show that he deserves a second term - we're not done, he said. But look, lots can happen between now and Election Day - as you well know. Not only can external events make a big difference, both in the economy and in other ways, but there can be lots of internal missteps - both by the administration, and by Democrats. We saw that in the last couple of weeks, where the new rules under his health-reform law have the Catholic hierarchy wildly upset - Newt Gingrich declaring that President Obama has declared war on the Catholic Church, and other Republican candidates basically saying the same thing, just in more polite terms. MONTAGNE: Well, what about that? I mean, everyone thought the culture wars had given way to concerns about the economy in this election - seems like it's not entirely so. ROBERTS: No, and the president's given ammunition there. These rules say that institutions like schools, hospitals, social-service agencies, that serve non-Catholics or other non-religious people, have to be covered with contraception, under health care. And, you know, it puts the president at odds with church-going people. And that's never a good place for the Democrats to be. They're always better off fighting on the economy, even in a bad economy. And - even given that the pro-abortion rights people won a fight with Susan G. Komen in the last week, this is not good territory for the Democrats. MONTAGNE: Cokie, thanks very much.

            "article_content": "GOP presidential nominee Mitt Romney gives a foreign policy speech Monday. Campaigning in Florida Sunday, he posed the question, \"Where's American leadership?\" And President Obama in L.A. poked fun at his own debate performance, and talked about falling unemployment numbers.  STEVE INSKEEP, HOST: Cokie Roberts performs flawlessly Monday after Monday here on MORNING EDITION. Cokie, good morning. (LAUGHTER) COKIE ROBERTS, BYLINE: Hi, Steve. How are you doing? INSKEEP: OK. I'm doing OK. I'm doing OK. So we're less than a month from voting day - the final voting day, I should say, since people are already voting in many places. Where does the race stand? ROBERTS: It's tied. As you said earlier, it's tightened up. But in the RealClearPolitics averages, it shows presidential candidates tied, generic congressional vote tied, the president's approval rating basically tied. This is really a neck-and-neck election, including in some battleground states, like Colorado and Virginia, that had seemed to be breaking for Obama before last week's debate. And that debate has also helped energize the Romney campaign. They claim that - their campaign claims that in the first 48 hours after the debate, they raised $12 million online, that 60 percent of that money was first-time donors, that their volunteers have increased by 63 percent. So it has really sent a spark of life into the Romney campaign. INSKEEP: Do you have wait a little while to determine if something like that really changes the election, or is it longer term trends that really make a difference? ROBERTS: Well, I think that the fundamentals of the election have been puzzling to Republicans all along, because when you have more than 40 months at 8 percent unemployment, the presidential approval rating that has been bumping below 50 percent, the growth rate as low as it is and people, by two to one, saying the country is off on the wrong track, and that should be in automatic incumbent-defeat territory. And even though people say the economy is the number-one issue, and they say in a couple of polls that they think the economy will get better under Romney than it will under Obama, what's been frustrating for the Republicans is with all of that, Romney has not been able to break out with the voters. So the debate might have helped him there. But, yes, there are other things going on, as well. The jobs reports on Friday showing the unemployment rate dropping below 8 percent was, you know, almost a little icing on the cake for the president, because Americans were already saying over the last several months that they think things are getting better, that they're personal economic situations are improving. And yes, they think the country is off on the wrong track, but that number has dropped dramatically over the last year. And all of that adds up to a more optimistic electorate looking toward the future, and that's what elections are about: the future, not the past. INSKEEP: So you have an economy that's weak, but it is perceived as gradually getting better. And you also have demographic trends that would favor the president. ROBERTS: Very much so, and that's where Romney's just going to continue to have big problems. It's hard for me to believe that any number of Spanish-language TV ads that he makes with the governor of Puerto Rico are going to make up for the rhetoric of the Republican primaries and, much more important, those laws that were passed in many states similar to the Arizona immigration law and the fact that Arizona Sheriff Joe Arpaio was at the Republican Convention, it just taints the Republican brand with Latinos, and it could for generations to come. And you add to that the voter ID laws that the Hispanics believe were designed to disenfranchise them, and you have a tough time getting them to vote Republican. You've already lost the African-Americans and, by and large, college-educated, white women are voting Democratic more and more. So it's - it's getting - getting to a majority, doing the arithmetic, it just becomes tough for Romney. INSKEEP: Okay. One other thing, Cokie. I was watching TV yesterday. We're in Washington, D.C., so it's the northern Virginia market. ROBERTS: You see all the Virginia ads. Right. INSKEEP: Oh, my gosh. It was basically continuous political ads, occasionally interrupted by a football game. But is all that money on the air making a difference? ROBERTS: Well, it certainly made a difference in creating a negative impression of Romney before he went up on the air after the conventions. But the National Journal has done an interesting study of all the ads in polling in battleground states and concluded they've helped Obama with non-college educated white women. Obama's been running ads in daytime TV, quoting Romney saying he'd stop federal funding for Planned Parenthood. And according to this analysis, these women see the cutoff of funds to things like contraception as an economic issue, not a social issue, where they tend to agree more with Republicans. If Obama can do well with that group or at least better with that group than he has before, his numbers look good. INSKEEP: OK, thanks very much. That's NPR's Cokie Roberts. And let's look at some of the numbers in tracking polls, which interview voters day by day. The Gallup survey found Obama five points ahead before the debate, tied afterwards. The Rasmussen tracking poll is also tied. This is NPR News. Copyright \u00a9 2012 NPR.  All rights reserved.

Among the many campaign events this weekend, was one sponsored by the Faith and Freedom Coalition, a national organization that wants to make sure Christian conservative and evangelical voters turn out in large numbers this year. NPR's Don Gonyea reports.  RACHEL MARTIN, HOST: This is WEEKEND EDITION from NPR News. I'm Rachel Martin. Wisconsin holds its presidential primary on Tuesday. Like the rest of the upper Midwest, where manufacturing has taken a hit over the past decade, the economy is the top issue in the state. Among the many events the GOP hopefuls are attending this weekend was one sponsored by the Faith and Freedom Coalition. It's a national organization that wants to make sure Christian conservative and evangelical voters turn out in large numbers this year. NPR national political correspondent Don Gonyea reports. DON GONYEA, BYLINE: For Faith and Freedom Coalition founder Ralph Reed, the reason President Obama won election four years ago is that Christian conservatives simply didn't turn out. He told his audience outside Milwaukee yesterday that this year they need to work much harder. RALPH REED: And pray more fervently than you've ever prayed. We have to make sure that what happened in 2008 when 17 million of our brothers and sisters in Christ didn't even bother to vote, we have to ensure that that never happens again. GONYEA: To that end, Faith and Freedom Coalition chapters in Iowa, South Carolina and elsewhere have been bringing candidates in to talk in advance of primaries all year. At those previous events, former House Speaker Newt Gingrich often stole the show. He was up first yesterday in Wisconsin, but this time, amid signs that his campaign is all but over, he was greeted more like an old friend. The former college history professor delved into the role of faith in the founding of the U.S. NEWT GINGRICH: We are the only society in history that says we have been endowed by our creator with certain unalienable rights. And that means we're the only society in history that says power comes from God to each one of you personally and then you loan power to the government. This is the... (SOUNDBITE OF APPLAUSE) GONYEA: Next, came the front-runner, Mitt Romney. He was introduced by Wisconsin congressman Paul Ryan, a home-state favorite who actually received the day's biggest ovation. Ryan has endorsed Romney, who then went through his standard criticism of the Obama administration. Getting special attention was the recent conflict between the White House and Catholic-owned hospitals, universities and other institutions over contraception coverage for employees. MITT ROMNEY: If I'm president of the United States, this great choice we have will make sure that in my case I will restore and protect religious freedom. We are one nation under God and that must be maintained. GONYEA: Romney's chief rival is Rick Santorum, who has staked much of his campaign on winning big among Christian and evangelical voters. He's trailing Romney in Wisconsin and is way behind in the delegate race. Santorum was the final candidate to take the stage. RICK SANTORUM: You know, one of the campaigns for president a week or so ago suggested that it would take an act of God for Rick Santorum to win the GOP nomination for president. Well, I don't know about you but I believe in act of God, so that's sort of where we're coming from. GONYEA: The fact that Romney seems on a steady path to the nomination made this event far less electric than Faith and Freedom events in prior states. And while many self-described Christian conservatives at those earlier events often voiced an anybody-but-Romney sentiment, there was no sign of that yesterday. In the audience was 65-year-old Dan Mancini of Wauwatosa who echoed what many party leaders are saying - that it's time to end the Republican versus Republican warfare and support Romney. DAN MANCINI: It's time we all get behind one candidate and move forward to defeat Barack Obama. It's that simple. GONYEA: But for retired small businessman David Horning of Pewaukee, such talk is still premature. DAVID HORNING: Oh, absolutely not, it's way too early for that. GONYEA: Why? HORNING: Well, there's plenty of time and it's a long election. It's a long election process. GONYEA: And after three months of primaries and caucuses and many months of campaigning before that, he's not yet ready for it to be over. But Horning does know one thing for sure: he will vote for any Republican against President Obama in November. He says turnout won't be an issue this year. Don Gonyea, NPR News, Milwaukee.

INSKEEP: Well, yesterday, Newt Gingrich was all over the airwaves saying this is now a two-man race, Newt Gingrich and Mitt Romney - no Rick Santorum in there, as far as he's concerned, or Ron Paul, for that matter. ROBERTS: Well, that is basically the case in terms of who is really at the top of this race. But look, the Republican establishment, such as it is, Republican officeholders and former officeholders are likely to weigh in against Newt Gingrich. Many have already, and they are very worried about his prospects of being elected. And the Republican electorate, though, continues to be unhappy about Mitt Romney. So that means that Rick Santorum is convinced that folks will eventually come to him as the only alternative, though we're beginning to see Republican editorial writers fantasizing about another candidate getting in at this very late date. Mitch Daniels, the governor of Indiana, will give the reply to the president's State of the Union Tuesday night. People are talking about him, but I think that's very unlikely. It's much more likely to be a long process, state by state. And Florida, as you just heard, is big because it's winner-take-all in the delegates, and it's big in the general election. But this could be a delegate-by-delegate process. Ron Paul is hoping to pick up some and have some clout in the - at the convention. And right now, it's Newt Gingrich who has the most delegates. INSKEEP: Well, let's recall that Newt Gingrich who was high in the polls back in December. Mitt Romney's superPAC and his campaign ran a lot of negative ads, which brought him down very quickly. Gingrich then, of course, attacked Romney, brought down Romney somewhat, but Romney still has lots of money. Why would it not work again for Romney to pull Gingrich back to earth? ROBERTS: And it might. That might be exactly what happens, but he no longer seems to be the inevitable candidate, the frontrunner. And Gingrich has found his voice, and his voice is that of the aggrieved voter who doesn't like Wall Street, doesn't like the media, doesn't like the government from Washington. He's essentially channeling Ronald Reagan, but less sunny, and much more analytical. But he's also hoping that Reagan is the example of the only divorced president who didn't seem to worry religious voters. Gingrich is hoping that works for him, as well. And the South Carolina exit polls seem to support him. We'll see how this plays out. I mean, his attack on the media worked very well for him in South Carolina, but Democrats are just salivating at running against Newt Gingrich with all of his baggage. But they should take a look at how they salivated against - running against Ronald Reagan, too, and maybe be careful what they wish for. INSKEEP: Well, Obama's campaign had hoped to follow Reagan's pattern of a first-term president who had a tough economy, but then the economy improved just in time and he sailed away with the election. Is there any sign that Obama could be following that pattern? ROBERTS: Well, he could be, absolutely, and he's trying to do that by appealing to the little guy, the middle-class voters, which he's likely to do again in the State of the Union. But, you know, Republicans are not buying anything he's saying these days. John Boehner, the speaker said that it would be, quote, \"pathetic\" if he offers the same old ideas, which Boehner says have made the economy worse. And the president does seem to be playing to his own base in several decisions lately, of not doing the Keystone Pipeline, refusing to give religious institutions exemptions on contraception coverage under health care. So, you know, he's also playing to the people who can elect him. INSKEEP: One member of Congress who will be there for the State of the Union, but not much longer in Congress, is Gabrielle Giffords, who said over the weekend she's stepping down. ROBERTS: Well, of course it's been such a hard road for her, and apparently, she discovered when she went to the year anniversary of the shooting in Arizona how difficult it was for her to do a public event. So a special election will be held in Arizona to fill her seat, and she says that she has to concentrate on her recovery. INSKEEP: Cokie, thanks very much.

            "article_content": "Women's issues were back front and center in politics on Wednesday after Indiana Senate candidate Richard Mourdock said in a debate Tuesday night that when a rape results in pregnancy \"it is something that God intended to happen.\" Democrats pounced and Mitt Romney distanced himself from the remarks. But the Romney campaign did not ask Mourdock to pull down a TV ad Romney taped for him. Mourdock is in a tight race with Democratic Rep. Joe Donnelly in an overall fierce contest for control of the U.S. Senate.  MELISSA BLOCK, HOST: From NPR News, this is ALL THINGS CONSIDERED. I'm Melissa Block. AUDIE CORNISH, HOST: And I'm Audie Cornish. We begin this hour with the election and not only the race for president. Today, Republicans are facing pressure to respond to controversial comments about rape and pregnancy from their party's Senate hopeful in Indiana. Richard Mourdock was taking part in a debate last night when the subject turned to abortion, as NPR's Brian Naylor reports. BRIAN NAYLOR, BYLINE: Mourdock opposes abortion in most cases, including for women who are victims of rape and incest. He was explaining that view in last night's debate and began speaking about his faith. RICHARD MOURDOCK: The only exception I have for - to have an abortion is in that case of the life of the mother. I just - I've struggle with it myself for a long time, but I came to realize life is a gift from God and I think even when life begins in that horrible situation of rape, that it is something that God intended to happen. NAYLOR: That phrase about rape and something that God intended to happen sparked an immediate bipartisan round of criticism. After the debate, Democratic Congressman Joe Donnelly, who is locked with Mourdock in a tight race for the Indiana Senate seat, said rape was an unspeakable crime and saying, I can't believe that my God or any God would ever intend for that to happen to anyone. This morning, Republican Congressman Mike Pence, who is running for governor of Indiana, issued a statement saying he strongly disagree with Mourdock and urged him to apologize. And a spokeswoman for Mitt Romney said the GOP presidential nominee also disagrees with Mourdock and that his comments do not reflect Romney's views. But the campaign did not ask Mourdock to pull down the TV ad Romney taped for Mourdock, the only such ad he's made in the campaign to date. (SOUNDBITE OF POLITICAL AD) NAYLOR: Mourdock's remarks have drawn inevitable comparisons with the comments made by another Republican Senate candidate Todd Akin in Missouri. In an interview this summer, Akin said women's body prevent them from becoming pregnant after what he termed legitimate rape. The chair of the Democratic National Committee, Florida Congresswoman Debbie Wasserman Schultz, says it's all part of a pattern. REPRESENTATIVE DEBBIE WASSERMAN SCHULTZ: Try as he may to distance himself, Mitt Romney has demonstrated time and time again that he is a part of the extreme right wing of the GOP with the likes of Richard Mourdock and Todd Akin. Especially when it comes to issues affecting women and their bodies. NAYLOR: The Obama campaign, which has made support for women's reproductive rights a key component of its efforts to gain women's votes also chimed in. Spokeswoman Jen Saki called it perplexing that Romney didn't ask that his ad for Mourdock be taken down and that President Obama felt Mourdock's comments were outrageous and demeaning to women. At a news conference today, Mourdock defended his comment, saying he was sorry if people misconstrued them. MOURDOCK: I spoke from my heart. For speaking from my heart, from speaking from the deepest level of my faith, I cannot apologize. I would be less than faithful to my faith if I said anything other than life is precious. I believe it is the gift from God. NAYLOR: The Republican Senate campaign committee struggling to win enough seats in the Senate to gain control quickly came to Mourdock's defense. Chairman John Cornyn issued a statement saying, \"Richard and I, along with millions of Americans, including even Joe Donnelly, believe that life is a gift of God.\" Donnelly opposes abortion except in cases involving rape, incest and the life of the woman. The controversy seems to be taking a toll on Mourdock. Republican Senator Kelly Ayotte of New Hampshire cancelled a scheduled appearance in Indiana for Mourdock and in an editorial today, the Louisville Courier Journal cited Mourdock's rape comments as it endorsed Donnelly for the Indiana Senate race.

            "article_content": "Banners hang inside the media center amid preparations for tonight's presidential debate at Hofstra University in Hempstead, N.Y.\n                \n                    \n                    Stan Honda/AFP/Getty Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption Banners hang inside the media center amid preparations for tonight's presidential debate at Hofstra University in Hempstead, N.Y. Tonight's presidential debate in New York is shaping up like an episode of the old game show To Tell the Truth: Will the real Barack Obama/Mitt Romney please stand up? There are a lot of questions about what personas and strategies the two candidates will choose to adopt. Partisans on both sides argue that their man's opponent is a shape-shifter. Democrats are convinced that part of the reason Romney won their first debate earlier this month is that he shamelessly lied about his own positions in tacking to the center. \"Mitt Romney seems to change who he is more than he changes his socks,\" says R.T. Rybak, the Democratic mayor of Minneapolis. \"We don't know who Mitt Romney is, and I imagine he'll change himself one more time this week.\" On the flip side, Republicans fully expect to see a different President Obama than the rather listless candidate who appeared on stage during the first debate. \"I expect the president to behave completely differently,\" says GOP Rep. Tim Griffin of Arkansas. Like many Democrats, Griffin predicts Obama will be more aggressive on the Hofstra University stage and at the same time try to be more respectful than his grinning, giggling running mate, Joe Biden, was during the vice presidential debate last week. Changing The Subject Back Romney won the first debate not just because of his aggressive posture, but by using detailed answers to present himself as a challenger well-prepared to assume the mantle of presidency. He managed in one night to undo much of the work the Obama campaign had done to try to make him seem out of touch. \"In the first debate, the minute Obama stepped out on that stage, he lost \u2014 without opening his mouth \u2014 because suddenly voters realized that this is a referendum on Obama,\" says William Schneider, a professor at George Mason University's School of Public Policy in Virginia. \"People realized we have to decide whether to rehire this guy or fire him.\" Obama's task in this debate is to change the subject back to Romney, touching up his campaign's portrait of the Republican as someone who is looking out for the interest of the wealthy elites at the expense of most Americans. \"I guarantee you that the president's team and the president have looked for every possible way to interrupt and take control of the conversation in their practice sessions,\" Griffin says. \"I expect him to come out fast and hard.\" An Invigorated Obama Obama neglected in the first debate to hector Romney about such matters as his career as a venture capitalist or his videotaped remarks about the \"47 percent\" of Americans who are \"dependent upon government.\" He won't neglect such topics this time around. \"He is the president, but he needs to show the American people that he is that fighter for them, that he still has a lot of work to do and that his policies are going to work better than those of Mitt Romney,\" says Leticia Van de Putte, a Democratic state senator in Texas. Obama may want to touch on issues that had been polling well for him prior to the first debate, such as reproductive rights for women. On those matters, as well as on economic and foreign policy, Obama's task will be to suggest that Romney's views \u2014 the ones he talked about throughout most of the campaign year, if not over the past two weeks \u2014 are unacceptable. Given the still-shaky economy and the president's approval ratings, which are hovering just around 50 percent, that's the only way for Obama to win, says Henry Olsen, a vice president at the American Enterprise Institute, a conservative think tank. \"You've got to dance with the girl that brung you,\" Olsen says. The Audience Matters But neither Obama nor Romney has control of tonight's agenda. Although both candidates will want to spend the evening firing up their base of supporters, they'll have to do so in a room where naked partisanship may be frowned upon. The questions in this town hall-style debate will be asked by members of an audience made up of undecided, registered voters. \"If President Obama wants to go into this debate like Joe Biden last week, that won't go over with an audience of undecided voters,\" says Schneider, who is also a senior fellow and resident scholar at Third Way, a centrist think tank. \"They want problem-solving, and their most deeply held belief is that politics is the enemy of problem-solving.\" Aside from style, audience members may throw out questions that the candidates aren't prepared for. And their concerns could be quite different from those of journalistic debate moderators. They might bring up important issues that have gone without much mention in this campaign season, such as gay marriage or immigration. The town hall-style format frames questions the way undecided voters do, says Andrew Romanoff, a former Democratic speaker of the Colorado House \u2014 questions like, \"Tell me how my life will get better if I put you in charge, instead of the other guy. \"What happens to my bank account? What happens if someone in my family gets sick? Tell me if my kid is going to get a job when he gets out of school,\" Romanoff says. \"Sometimes those bread-and-butter concerns get lost in a blizzard of statistics and studies.\" Romney's Chance Romney has sometimes stumbled when asked unexpected questions by members of the public. He could face a \"YouTube moment\" if asked something that puts him on the spot, says Jack Pitney, a government professor at Claremont McKenna College in California. Pitney imagines a woman asking, \"Gov. Romney, I just had an abortion. Do you think I belong in jail?\" But AEI scholar Olsen says the format also gives Romney the chance \"to address his most damaging weakness\" by convincing the public that he's up to the job of president not just on a managerial level but also on an emotional level. \"If he, in a relatively unscripted setting, can demonstrate the type of sincerity and kindness and articulateness that he had in the first debate, then it almost doesn't matter what he says,\" Olsen says. Although much media speculation leading up to tonight has turned on the question of whether Obama can stage a comeback from the first debate, the Romney camp is hopeful that the second encounter will give their man the chance to continue, if not complete, a successful wooing of a majority of the American electorate. \"What happened in the first debate was, with everybody paying attention, Romney demonstrated he sure enough was an acceptable alternative,\" says Republican consultant John Hancock. \"That probably dealt as big a blow to the Obama campaign apparatus as anything else.\"",

Both the incumbent and his challenger have been in and out of the state with increasing frequency; GOP vice presidential candidate Paul Ryan plans a trip to the Buckeye State on Friday, after his tangle with Vice President Joe Biden. And we'll be there tonight to watch the debate southwest of Columbus with the entrepreneurial, multigenerational Barnes farm family \u2014 grain, organic vegetables, honey bees, golf course \u2014 whose members' political views run the gamut. It's in the Columbus area, particularly the \"collar\" counties that surround the big university town, where the Ohio race \u2014 and, quite possibly the national contest, too \u2014 will likely be decided, says John Green, director of the Ray C. Bliss Institute of Applied Politics at the University of Akron. Those collar counties are more conservative than Columbus, but Obama made inroads there in 2008 with suburbanites more liberal on cultural issues and \"not reflexively Republican,\" Green says. \"They could decide the election.\" Ohio is still a state that favors Obama, even after his roundly panned debate performance last week that has given Romney, the Republican, at least a small immediate boost in other key swing states. The president had a more comfortable lead in the pre-debate polls in Ohio, when three surveys \u2014 including one by The Columbus Dispatch \u2014 had the Democrat leading Romney by up to 10 points. An NBC/Wall Street Journal/Marist Poll released today has Obama ahead in Ohio 51-45 percent, where his supporters have dominated early voting, but down 2 percentage points from the group's previous poll. The Real Clear Politics over-time average gives the president a 1.6 percentage point edge over Romney in Ohio. \"Things have tightened up, and the debate has something to do with it,\" says Green. \"But this is the way things tend to work in Ohio. ... We have these swings, but we also have periods where it's very even,\" he says, adding that sometimes it's simply due to who has most recently been campaigning in the state. \"It really reminds me of 2004,\" Green says, when an \"incumbent with problems\" \u2014 then it was President George W. Bush \u2014 won the state with 50 percent of the vote on his way to re-election. No Republican, we are obligated to note, has won the White House without winning Ohio. Obama won here in 2008, with 51.5 percent of the vote. On Thursday, a federal appeals court ruled that the state must count provisional ballots cast in the wrong precinct because of poll worker error, a defeat for Ohio's Republican secretary of state. Not A Sure Thing The state's 7.2 percent unemployment rate, lower than the 7.8 percent national average, and Obama's support of government loans that shored up the auto industry \u2014 vital to Ohio's economy \u2014 are part of the reason he's hanging on to a lead. That's not to suggest that the 2012 Ohio election story has been told. Just look at a post-debate Bloomberg News Swing State poll released this week that showed Romney's support among married women in Ohio on the rise. Before the Oct. 3 presidential debate, several polls suggested that Obama was not only continuing the Democrats' historic dominance with unmarried women, but also was cutting into Republicans' usual edge with married women. Women are the key to Obama's fortunes; polls show Romney running stronger with white men, with the president on course to win fewer votes from that demographic than he did four years ago. \"I think the debate clearly mattered,\" says J. Ann Selzer, the pollster who directed the telephone poll. Selzer's survey found that married Ohio women, a demographic dominated by white women, preferred Obama's stances on reproductive rights and also said he better understood their problems. But the married women, particularly those not working a full-time job, were moving toward Romney because they said they viewed him as more capable of grappling with the nation's economic problems \u2014 even though by a 2-to-1 margin they said they supported the auto industry loans, and live in a state that is doing better than most economically. What happened? \"What I would speculate,\" Selzer says, \"is their support for Obama was soft, and that they're likely in a household with a husband who voted for [GOP presidential nominee] John McCain in 2008 and is for Romney now.\" During the debate with Obama, Romney succeeded in laying out \"some very simple promises: I won't raise the deficit; I won't raise taxes on the middle class,\" Selzer says. While partisans can argue the consistency or veracity of the promises \u2014 and they are \u2014 the performance resonated. \"It was forceful and simple,\" Selzer says, \"and President Obama didn't counter with anything like it.\" The timing of the debate has benefited Romney, too, she says, with two weeks between the first and the second presidential debate, scheduled for Tuesday. Frenzied Weeks Ahead The campaigns have upped their advertising buys in a presidential election that has already seen more than $110 million dumped into the state. With 26 days before Election Day, Ward Weber II, 50, one of those Columbus-area Republicans who is liberal on social issues \u2014 \"I'm a staunch Republican,\" he says, \"but not an unreasonable one\" \u2014 still sees the race breaking for Obama. Unless, he says, Ohio's Republican Gov. John Kasich can make a strong case in these final weeks that the state's economic stability had as much or more to do with the governor's policies than with those of the president. \"Romney has to get Kasich out there, on television and other places; he has to hope that Paul Ryan has a good debate; and that he [Romney] can follow up with another debate winner next week,\" says Weber, a married father of two who works as a manufacturer's representative for a heating and cooling company. Romney was the candidate Weber \u2014 who voted for McCain in 2008 but for President Clinton in 1996 \u2014 preferred before the debate for economic reasons. Both candidates still have work to do in Ohio \u2014 Obama with married women, and Romney with a base that includes Republican men who may have given their vote to the other side last time around. \"Each side is trying very hard to mobilize their base,\" says Green, of the University of Akron. \"This now is not about persuasion, but about stimulating people to vote.\"",

A soft murmur of familiarity rippled through the packed GOP convention hall Tuesday night when Mitt Romney's wife, Ann, spoke not of their \"storybook marriage\" but of one touched by cancer, multiple sclerosis and the trials of raising five sometimes screaming children. \"A storybook marriage? Not at all,\" she said, during her much anticipated prime-time speech. \"What Mitt Romney and I have is a real marriage.\" It was that moment that encapsulated the job that Ann Romney had to do, and how well she managed it. From her perch of privilege and prerogative, she managed to convey not ordinariness, but at least a familiarity with struggle and a connection with women \u2014 actually, mothers were her exclusive focus \u2014 who have gone to bed exhausted; who have struggled with health issues as she has with breast cancer and multiple sclerosis; and who, when juggling the demands of raising children and running a home while her husband pursued his education and fortune, has wondered what she'd gotten herself into. \"I was so glad she had this opportunity to talk to the women of America, to have them hear about the trials they went through,\" said Barbara Bair, 47, a convention delegate from York, Pa. \"And to hear that her husband is a man that stands behind her, supporting her through breast cancer. There is nothing scarier for families than cancer.\" Supporters react during Ann Romney's speech on Tuesday at the Republican National Convention.\n                \n                    \n                    Becky Lettenberger/NPR\n                    \n                \nhide caption Supporters react during Ann Romney's speech on Tuesday at the Republican National Convention. The speech, the experts and pundits proclaimed, needed to humanize Mitt Romney. But it really served as a vehicle to humanize her \u2014 a woman of great attractiveness and expensive polish \u2014 and, by extension, him. And that's all intended, of course, to help him appeal more to women who have been spooked by the Republican Party's positions on reproductive and workplace rights. \"She may have privilege, but she understands,\" said Kitty Dunn, 65, a Utah delegate who has met the Romneys. That's not to say that Ann Romney stuck with her speech's opening line, \"I want to talk to you about love.\" About halfway through her speech, the soft tones of reminiscence of family and young love gave way to a tougher, more strident defense of her husband, his unheralded good works, his business success. \"Do we want to raise our children to be afraid of success?\" she asked with a tough edge. And she defended Bain as a dream launcher, a company that \"has helped so many others lead better lives.\" That part was clearly a tougher sell. But her soft sell, from her \"I love you women!\" exclamation \u2014 it wasn't on the teleprompter \u2014 and the connection she made talking about her own struggles, was effective. \"She gave an energetic explanation of marriage \u2014 and I know, because I have three children at home,\" said Greg Treat, 34, a delegate and state senator from Oklahoma. \"I think Ann Romney will make a difference. Michelle Obama is a huge positive for the president, and Mrs. Romney will be for her husband as well.\"",

Mitt Romney, 65, has spent the better part of a decade running for president. And as the son of a Michigan governor who headed a Detroit auto company, he's been in the public eye much longer. Yet the former Massachusetts governor has remained an enigma to many voters, his political positions malleable, and much of his business and private life \u2014 including his Mormon religion \u2014 intentionally obscured. Or simply declared off limits, like years of his tax returns. In coming days, however, Romney, an unsuccessful GOP primary candidate in 2008, has the opportunity to begin dissolving the mystery of Mitt as he accepts his party's nomination at the Republican National Convention in Tampa. He'll arrive in Florida locked in a bitter, dead-heat national contest with President Obama, facing an uphill battle in important battleground states but within striking distance of the White House.

The convention, however, comes in the wake of a tumultuous political period that has put Republicans and Romney, who amassed great wealth as a Boston-based private equity guru, on the defensive about women's health and reproductive rights, and over the remaking of Medicare under the budget plan of his running mate, Rep. Paul Ryan of Wisconsin. Romney drove the conversation further off message Friday, when he made a joke in his home state of Michigan about how \"no one's ever asked to see my birth certificate.\" It was a reference to the fringe \"birther\" conspiracists who, despite evidence showing that Obama was born in Hawaii, continue to question his birthplace. It's far from the economy-and-jobs message the nominee-in-waiting intended to ride to Tampa and beyond. But in the convention, Tropical Storm Isaac permitting, lies great potential for a national relaunch of Romney, who emerged from a rollicking primary season as the establishment candidate. And he's been giving clear hints of what he'll emphasize. In recent days, Romney has touted lessons learned from his Bain Capital business experience and his work on the Salt Lake City Olympics. He's also talked about his late father's influence and taken a \"drill, baby, drill\" page from Sarah Palin's 2008 convention playbook. As Romney moves to the big, potentially defining stage in Tampa, we looked at what the candidate might want to do to make a case for himself to a national audience. Talk To Ohio Ohio voters may be leaning toward Obama at this point in the race, according to two new polls, but the state with its trove of 18 electoral votes remains the ultimate battleground this fall. Romney would be well-advised to imagine he is speaking directly to the Buckeye State voters, if not by name, because the payoff would resonate far behind the state's boundaries, says Eric Rademacher, director of the Ohio Poll out of the University of Cincinnati. And that means talking about the economy \u2014 not selling a Medicare redo or defending an abortion position. \"We have conducted the Ohio Poll since 1982, and during that time I have been frequently surprised at the degree to which the attitudes and opinions match the attitudes and opinions of Americans as reflected in national polls,\" Rademacher says. \"The current Ohio Poll is no different.\" Released this week, it shows Ohio voters focused on economic conditions \u2014 jobs, lowering unemployment and addressing the budget deficit and federal debt. \"The president will continue to emphasize the positives on his record and his plan for the future,\" Rademacher says. \"The onus is on the Romney campaign to critique Obama's presidency and to provide an alternative.\" All other issues will be prioritized by how well they connect to economic considerations, he says, barring a significant foreign policy event. There is still opportunity to persuade voters: In Ohio, 13 percent of voters supporting either Romney or Obama told Ohio Poll surveyors that they were open to changing their minds; 4 percent said they were undecided. \"Sometimes we forget that politics is not exactly the No. 1 passion of Americans,\" Rademacher said, pointing to this opportunity for Romney: \"Many Ohio voters have not paid much attention to politics since the primaries.\" Now, they are. Embrace Religion, Gently Romney will make history this week when he becomes the first Mormon to accept the presidential nomination of a major political party. \"It's a notable moment,\" says religion expert David Campbell, a political scientist who directs the University of Notre Dame's Rooney Center for the Study of American Democracy. He is also a Mormon. \"This is the first presidential election ever where none of the presidential or vice presidential candidates are white Protestants, and that's really remarkable,\" Campbell says. \"It says something about the diversity of American, not just racial, but religion, too.\" With polls showing conservative Christians \u2014 a key part of the GOP base \u2014 uncomfortable with Romney's religion, the candidate has worn his faith lightly and only recently invited reporters to join him during a Mormon service. He addressed his faith in a 2007 speech, but not specifically again. Campbell suggests, however, that Romney's faith is a key to voters' understanding of him and how he leads his life. \"The course of this campaign has demonstrated that when Mitt Romney's experience as a leader in the church is covered in the press, it serves to deepen voters' understanding of him,\" Campbell says. \"It humanizes him, and I think there's not much risk in opening that part of his life.\" Chronicles of Romney's time as a pastorlike Mormon bishop in Boston include accounts of him meeting with couples struggling in their marriages and meeting with families, and have evoked powerful images. \"It seems to me that when that side of his faith is put on display, it can only help him,\" Campbell says. \"Undoubtedly, in the campaign they are considering whether [if] they open that door, it will swing wide open and all questions about Mormonism will emerge.\" A bit unfairly, it can be argued. Romney's vice presidential pick Ryan, and Vice President Biden, both Catholics, aren't quizzed on their church's belief in transubstantiation, Campbell notes. Nor was Connecticut Sen. Joseph Lieberman, the Democratic Party's vice presidential nominee in 2000, who is Jewish, asked to authenticate the story of Moses parting the Red Sea. Mormons, proud of the positive publicity the church received after Salt Lake City hosted the 2002 Winter Olympics, were surprised at the antagonism and resistance Romney faced for his beliefs when he ran in 2008, Campbell says. Romney has a balance to strike, certainly, but if he can talk about his faith in a way that helps voters relate to him, it could be invaluable. Why? He continues to trail Obama badly among voters on that elusive \"likability\" measure. Humanize, Humanize, Humanize At the 1992 Democratic convention, the party introduced its candidate with a film called The Man from Hope. It launched Bill Clinton, in all his promise and with a nod to his flaws, into the national consciousness and is considered the gold standard \u2014 no matter your feelings about the former president \u2014 in political messaging. Hollywood film and television producer Harry Thomason and his wife, Linda Bloodworth-Thomason, created the film and managed the president's image for years to come. We asked Harry Thomason how Romney's team should introduce him next week; how the longtime married father of five, and grandfather of 18, could replicate the moment Clinton had two decades ago. \"They've got to pluck a few heartstrings,\" Thomason says. But he adds that creating a compelling human narrative for Romney presents more challenges than it did for Clinton, whose hardscrabble beginnings in the segregated South and burning ambition provided enough material for \"three good acts.\" \"The problem is that [Romney] seems to have suffered very little adversity, and in storytelling it helps if there's something that doesn't go right,\" Thomason says. \"He seems like a very nice guy, a private person, and that's admirable,\" he says. \"So you have to use the people who know him best to tell the story \u2014 family and very close friends. The kinds of things that you can make resonate \u2014 not something he can tell, but others can.\" People who are going to vote are going to watch the conventions, said Thomason, an Obama supporter. \"I believe,\" he says, \"this is terribly important for him.\" On that, Obama and Romney supporters can agree.",

            "article_content": "The Republican primaries were certainly fun while they lasted, especially for political journalists and junkies for whom the intramural fighting generated no shortage of interesting and sometimes bizarre story lines. But President Obama's campaign aides were all but certain from the start that they would be running against Mitt Romney. That was one of the few areas of agreement between the former Massachusetts governor's campaign and the Obama people. With Republicans consolidating their support behind Romney in Tuesday's primaries and Newt Gingrich acknowledging Wednesday that further resistance to Romney is futile, there's no longer doubt that the general election campaign has begun. And it begins with both Obama and Romney facing uphill battles. For Obama, the greatest challenge remains the uncertain state of the economy. A still relatively high unemployment rate and other economic indicators have  left him vulnerable. Gallup reported this week that his approval rating has again reached 50 percent, a level it hit just weeks ago, before sliding a bit. A string of bad economic news could cause it to fall again. But Obama faces the challenge of reconnecting with many of the voters whose imaginations he captured in 2008. Meanwhile, Romney's challenge is the way a tough primary fight forced him to describe himself as a \"severe conservative\" and to move right ideologically to placate his party's base. Now, he'll need to moderate his positions to appeal to the general electorate. What's more, for many voters, Romney isn't exactly the most charismatic candidate. \"Romney has a personal and an ideological roadblock to overcome; Obama has an economic roadblock,\" says Dan Schnur, a former John McCain aide who's now director of the University of Southern California's Jesse M. Unruh Institute of Politics. \"Whichever one gets over the roadblock better gets to be president.\" While both the president and Romney have steep hills to climb, however, Romney is going up against the arc of recent American history. Schnur says: \"My favorite factoid on presidential politics? Over the last half a century, every American president who has faced a primary challenge has not been re-elected. Lyndon Johnson in 1968, Gerald Ford in 1976, Jimmy Carter in 1980, George H.W. Bush in 1992. Except for Johnson they all won their nominations, but they all went on to lose the general election campaign. On the flip side, every American president for half a century who has avoided a significant primary challenge has been re-elected. Nixon in '72, Reagan in '84, Clinton in '96, George W. Bush in 2004. So it's not a coincidence. When you face primary challenge you spend a lot more time tending to your party base. If you avoid the challenge, you can begin to move to the center a lot earlier.\" Romney's need to fight for the heart and soul of his party's base meant that he took positions on immigration and reproductive rights, for instance, that didn't sit well with members of key segments of the electorate \u2014 women, young people and Latinos. Thus, Romney probably will need to spend much of the next six months-plus trying to define himself for enough of these voters as someone they could trust in the White House. Obama has his own difficulties. William Galston, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution who also was a Clinton White House policy adviser, says political science research uniformly suggests that \"when there's an election involving an incumbent, the incumbent's record take center stage.\" In this case, Galston, says, the record is decidedly mixed. Voters approve of the auto bailout and the Dodd-Frank financial reforms but disapprove in large numbers of the health-care law, Obama's signature legislative victory. And then there's the economy. Voters credit Obama with keeping it from going over the cliff but are impatient with its continued difficulties. Many voters, Galston says, still believe the economy is in recession. \"Obama would love to be able to run his version of Reagan's 'Morning in America' campaign, would love to be able to say 'It's been a long dark night, but the sun has now risen on a new day. We're moving in the right direction. Why would we turn back?' \"I know that campaign well because I was Walter Mondale's issues director. I remember it as though it were yesterday. And there was no answer to that. Well, the president right now is not in a position to run such a campaign. But he could conceivably be if things break his way. \"Unfortunately, it doesn't look to me as though things are breaking his way....\" Instead, Galston points to renewed uncertainties in the Euro zone and slowdowns in some fast-growing economies such as China and Brazil, all of which threaten to slow U.S. exports which had been giving the American economy some much-needed buoyancy. Galston adds: \"The economic outlook for the president is dicey. The outlook for the election is similarly so.\" In a recent New Republic piece, Galston also explained why Obama will have problems replicating much of the excitement of four years ago. The challenges facing Obama and Romney help explain why both campaigns and their superPAC allies will be relying on massive advertising blitzes in coming months to try to knock the opponent's approval numbers down significantly before Nov. 6. Reports are that Romney and the Republican National Committee have a fundraising goal of $800 million. For its part, the Obama campaign and its allies intend to raise the better part of a $1 billion themselves, even though campaign aides have often denied that number. Much of the money on both sides will go to negative ads aimed at making the other side's candidate unacceptable to as many voters as possible while energizing the base. As Schnur says: \"Both Romney and Obama are going to have difficulty motivating their respective bases this fall. Well, if you can't motivate your base by saying things that get them excited about you, tell them things that get them excited about your opponent.\"",

But narrowing the divide could help him win the White House. \n                \n                    \n                    Steven Senne/AP\n                    \n                \nhide caption Mitt Romney may not be able to single-handedly close the gender gap that favors Democrats. But narrowing the divide could help him win the White House. In case you haven't figured it out by now, female voters are seen as potentially holding the key to the White House in 2012. President Obama's hopes of being re-elected very much reside in the hands of women, the same part of the electorate whose strong support in 2008 helped make his victory possible. Knowing that helps explain all the charges from Democrats that Mitt Romney, the presumptive Republican nominee, is part of a larger Republican \"war on women\" because of his conservative stance on reproductive rights. It also explains Republican counterattacks that it's Obama who has waged a war against women. Their evidence? That the president's alleged mishandling of the economy has caused women to lose more jobs, and to regain them more slowly, than men during his time in office. (While that is superficially true, it's also deceptive.) So think of all the accusations of a \"war on women\" as part of what is really a \"war for women voters\" being waged by both Democratic and Republican campaigns. Of course, wars often produce instances of friendly fire. One such in the Obama-Romney fight was Obama supporter Hilary Rosen's shot that Ann Romney \"hasn't worked a day in her life.\" The outrage from the right, and the effort by Obama White House and campaign officials to distance themselves from the right, left Rosen as the casualty on this particular battlefield. If there was an Obama White House photo op in her future, it's gone now. But the Rosen tempest is small potatoes compared with the enormousness of the problem facing Romney. A recent USA Today/Gallup Poll poll conducted in 12 battleground states showed Obama opening up a 19-percentage-point lead over Romney among women, a monstrous gender gap. That was up 7 points from earlier in the year. That clearly was trending in a terrible way. Since 1980, Republican presidential candidates have received fewer votes from women than their Democratic rivals. It was 11 percentage points, for instance, in 1996 when President Bill Clinton won re-election against the Republican nominee, Sen. Bob Dole of Kansas. Exit polls from 2008 demonstrate how being on the positive side of that gap helped put Obama in the White House. Obama and the Republican nominee, Sen. John McCain, pretty much split the male vote, Obama 49 percent to McCain's 48 percent. But Obama won the female vote by 13 percentage points. The president got 56 percent to McCain's 43 percent. Outperforming McCain in attracting female voters would go some way toward helping Romney capture the White House. But he has much ground to cover just to get to where McCain was in November 2008. Susan Carroll, senior scholar at the Center for American Women and Politics at Rutgers University, said Romney's problem with female voters is compounded by the fact that there are 10 million more female voters than male voters. They vote at a higher rate and skew Democratic: CARROLL: \"There's a party identification difference now between women and men ... women are just more Democratic than they are Republican, more Democratic than men are. So any Democrat starts with an advantage among women and any Republican starts with a disadvantage. So it's a big gap to make up. The Republican strategy is to try to minimize that gap as much as possible. Carroll said Romney is taking on the problem in probably the best way left open to him, talking about the economic issues. Because he had to move right on social issues to counter Rick Santorum, before the former U.S. senator quit the race, those are issues best avoided. \"I think he will score some blows against the Obama administration on economic issues. The Obama administration has some vulnerability there. He will score some points. I think the biggest challenge for Romney in talking about the economic issues with women is going to be relating to them and relating to their lives. \"What pollsters will always say about women voters from their polling and focus groups is that women are concerned with their sort of kitchen table economic issues. Which means, they want someone who can talk to them about the economic issues in the way that people would talk about them sitting around a kitchen table. They want to hear about what the candidate is going to do to affect the issues as they relate to them and their lives. \"And that's where I think Romney faces the biggest challenge. Because he's not proven himself very skilled or adept at relating to the average voter yet. And it's not clear that he'll get a lot better. Maybe he will; maybe he'll improve. But it's hard. There's not much in his life experience that he can probably draw upon to relate to some of the economic struggles people are facing. ... He's got to come across as somehow authentic and understanding and able to relate to the average American woman who is faced with a series of economic issues in terms of her own household and family situation.\"",

Read Another Opinion About How The Romney Can Succeed Ed Kilgore is a special correspondent for The New Republic, a blogger for The Washington Monthly, and managing editor of The Democratic Strategist. In the two months since Eric Fehrnstrom's \"etch-a-sketch\" gaffe, many political observers have waited for the iconic moment when Romney would move to the center or distance himself from the toxic conservative ideological battles of the primary season. But without much notice, that etch-a-sketch moment has already happened. No, Romney has not shifted positions. Nor has he disrespected the conservative activists whose votes and trust he sought so relentlessly since 2007. What his campaign has done, however, is radically narrow its focus to a single message, one particularly attractive to swing voters: that this election is purely and simply a referendum on Obama's economy. This focus comes at the expense of the philosophical, social, and cultural topics that dominated the primary season from beginning to end. There's one problem though: His party's conservative base may not let him get away with it. Barely an hour goes by these days without a Romney surrogate staring into a camera and intoning like an incantation that the election is about nothing other than Obama's responsibility for a poor economy. As Jonathan Chait recently noted, even the much-asked question on Romney's poor standing with Hispanic voters is routinely answered by citing the economic sufferings of Hispanics and the certainty that they, too, will ignore every other factor and vote for Mr. Fix-It. The narrow focus of Romney's campaign makes it easier for him to deal with right-wing efforts to drag the campaign discourse into dangerous areas. This was evident in last week's brouhaha over reports that billionaire Joe Ricketts and star GOP consultant Fred Davis were discussing a $10 million super PAC ad campaign resurrecting the president's relationship with Reverend Jeremiah Wright. Romney's campaign quickly repudiated the proposed ad, but just as quickly, RNC chairman Reince Priebus brought things back on message, accusing the Obama campaign of using criticism of the proposed ads to distract from the only issue that matters: Obama's responsibility for a poor economy. So long as his campaign doesn't look like it's on the verge of losing \u2014 as McCain looked in the fall of 2008 when conservatives began openly protesting his reluctance to bring up Jeremiah Wright \u2014 Romney can probably avoid visible conservative criticism for failing to raise a broader, cultural critique of Obama as a secular-socialist elitist whose association with Wright and Bill Ayers shows he hates America. But there are other, less controversial, issues important to conservative voters that don't nicely fit into a monomaniacal focus on the unemployment rate or monthly job figures. Romney is fortunate that Republicans agree that debts, deficits, and the size of government are all highly germane to the case for \"firing\" Obama on purely economic grounds. But many conservatives are concerned about these themes not because they affect the country's short-term economic prospects, but for more ideological reasons: because they are morally offended by federal programs that \"redistribute\" wealth, or by the very idea of progressive taxation, or by the religious implications of environmentalism. And unsurprisingly, many conservatives want their ideological motivations to be reflected in the Romney campaign's rhetoric. As a result, Romney has been all but forced to endorse Paul Ryan's budget, which makes explicit the conservative desire to abandon the Great Society safety net and to reverse any public-sector policies that alter the \"natural\" market-based distribution of wealth. In that way, the Romney campaign has the economic themes of a \"centrist\" campaign, but, in order to placate the concerns of his base, the details of speeches and other communications sometimes often veer into fringe territory. It is an open question how long the candidate can finesse this tension. Beyond the cluster of economic-fiscal issues, there are a host of cultural issues which Romney's campaign is trying to avoid, but which both conservative activists and the Obama campaign may insist he discuss. One of these is \"religious liberty\" \u2014 defined as the right for conservative religious organizations to discriminate against gays and lesbians or against reproductive rights for women. Another is same-sex marriage, an increasingly unavoidable campaign issue that pulls the campaign away from its focus on the economy. Conservative activists will also be eager to campaign against Obamacare, particularly if the Supreme Court forces the issue directly into the center of the presidential contest. And even if conservative activists \u2014 and the Obama campaign \u2014 don't succeed in broadening Romney's economic focus, another factor may intervene: The economy could improve. more than is currently projected between now and November. Chait's article on the Romney campaign's economic monomania suggests it will shift to a \"Plan B\" argument that the economy is just not improving enough. But instead, they may be forced to refocus on all those broader ideological issues \u2014 religious liberty, same-sex marriage, and health care, and perhaps more \u2014 that they're currently trying to avoid. If that happens, then both conservative activists and their enemies in the Obama campaign will get something they want, and the etch-a-sketch will shake up the message yet again.",

Kucinich lost his primary race against his Democratic opponent, Representative Marcy Kaptur. Read Another Opinion On Congressman Dennis Kucinich John Nichols writes about politics for The Nation as its Washington correspondent. Ohio Congressman Dennis Kucinich, a two-time presidential candidate who for the past decade has been the most consistent critic of war and militarism in the US House of Representatives, was defeated Tuesday in a Democratic primary that pitted him against fellow progressive Marcy Kaptur. Kucinich was the first electoral victim of the current round of redistricting, which saw congressional districts redrawn in states across the country after the 2010 Census. A Republican governor and legislature carved up northern Ohio districts with an eye toward eliminating at least one Democratic seat, and they achieved their goal by forcing Kucinich and Kaptur into the same district. That district favored Kaptur and, after a hard-fought race she prevailed by a fifty-six to thirty-nine margin, with the remainder going to a third candidate. Though the race in Ohio's 9th District received scant attention compared with the Republican presidential contest in the state, the result will have national consequences. A Congress without Dennis Kucinich will be a lesser branch. It's not just that the loss of the former leader of the Congressional Progressive Caucus will rob the House of its most consistent critic of wars in Iraq, Afghanistan and Libya, and one its steadiest critics of corporate power. Since he arrived on the Hill in 1997, Kucinich has been one of a handful of absolutely engaged members. When issues have arisen, be it domestic or international, low profile or high, Kucinich has been at the ready \u2014 often with the first statement, the strongest demand and the boldest plan. A master of parliamentary procedure, and a Constitutional purist, Kucinich has given Democratic and Republican congressional leaders their share of headaches. And he has been more than willing to break with Democratic and Republican presidents on matters of principle. But even as he frustrated the most powerful players in Washington, Kucinich won an enthusiastic base of supporters who backed him for the Democratic presidential nominations in 2004 and 2008. Though he never got near the nomination in either year, Kucinich earned high marks for forcing the other contenders to address fundamental issues of war and peace, civil liberties and trade policy. At the same time, he remained sufficiently in touch with his blue-collar Cleveland-area district \u2014 turf that had previously elected a Republican \u2014 to keep his seat in the face of primary and general election challenges from candidate backed by the political and media elites that had been after Kucinich since his days as the uncompromising \"boy mayor\" of Cleveland. Had his district remained intact, Kucinich would have won Tuesday's primary. But the 2010 election put Republican Governor John Kasich and his conservative allies in charge of the Ohio redistricting process. With encouragement from House Speaker John Boehner, they targeted Kucinich from the start. Everyone knew Kucinich was threatened, and the congressman even entertained the prospect of moving to Washington state, where he has long been a favorite of progressive activists and where population shifts had created an open seat that might be friendly to his ambitions. Ultimately, however, Kucinich opted for a race in a redrawn Ohio district that included portions of his Cleveland base. The district also included Toledo, the home of Congresswomen Kaptur, a Democrat with whom Kucinich had frequently allied over the years. Kucinich and Kaptur have both served in Congress as outsiders, members of the Progressive Caucus, with records of opposing wars, free-trade deals and economic policies that favor the 1 percent over the 99 percent. Both have 95 percent AFL-CIO records. Both have 100 percent ACLU records. There were, to be sure, distinctions. Kucinich, who for many years voted with opponents of reproductive rights, switched his position before the 2004 presidential election and ran this year as the more socially liberal contender. Kaptur, the longest serving woman in the House and a champion of many feminist causes, was ranked as a \"mixed choice\" by NARAL Pro-Choice America. Kucinich was always the purest anti-war champion, and he made a point of highlighting that in the race with Kaptur, a ranking member of the House Appropriations Committee, who the Cleveland congressman argued should have done much more to cut the Pentagon budget. But Kaptur, who came to national prominence as an outspoken foe of the 2008 bank bailout, emerged as a national hero of union and community activists who shared her determination to \"bust the banksters.\" She was a star of the film Capitalism, a Love Story, in which she told filmmaker Michael Moore that the 2008 bailout was a \"a financial coup d'\u00e9tat.\" Kaptur's boldness in opposing the big banks and Wall Street, as well as her passionate advocacy on behalf organized labor, would have been missed, as well, in a Congress that needs all the economic populists it can get. But losing Kucinich will be hard. In some of the toughest days for the American experiment as a Republican administration plotted to wage a war of whim in Iraq, Democratic \"leaders\" stood down. It was Dennis Kucinich who spoke up for peace and who kept speaking up with a determination that gave hope to activists across the United States and around the world. The Republican mapmakers in Ohio may have drawn Dennis Kucinich out of his district, and out of Congress. But they will not draw him out of the history of these times. Indeed, when the story of America in the first years of the 21st century is told, Dennis Kucinich will be remembered as the rare member of Congress who opposed wars that could not be justified, who defended rights that could not be surrendered, who demanded accountability from the presidents and vice presidents who could not be allowed to have their way with the republic.",

Read Another Opinion On Ron Paul Daniel W. Drezner is professor of international politics at the Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy at Tufts University. Ross Douthat had a great column to start the new year, offering his own interpretation on the Ron Paul phenomenon.  His last few paragraphs: \"There's often a fine line between a madman and a prophet. Perhaps Paul has emerged as a teller of some important truths precisely because in many ways he's still as far out there as ever. The United States is living through an era of unprecedented elite failure, in which America's public institutions are understandably distrusted and our leadership class is justifiably despised. Yet politicians of both parties are required, by the demands of partisanship, to embrace the convenient lie that our problem can be pinned exclusively on the other side's elites \u2014 as though both liberals and conservatives hadn't participated in the decisions that dug our current hole. In this climate, it sometimes takes a fearless crank to expose realities that neither Republicans nor Democrats are particularly eager to acknowledge. In both the 2008 and 2012 campaigns, Paul has been the only figure willing to point out the deep continuities in American politics \u2014 the way social spending grows and overseas commitments multiply no matter which party is in power, the revolving doors that connect K Street to Congress and Wall Street to the White House, the long list of dubious policies and programs that both sides tacitly support. In both election cycles, his honest extremism has sometimes cut closer to the heart of our national predicament than the calculating partisanship of his more grounded rivals. He sometimes rants, but he rarely spins \u2014 and he's one of the few figures on the national stage who says \"a plague on both your houses!\" and actually means it. Obviously it would be better for the country if this message weren't freighted with Paul's noxious baggage, and entangled with his many implausible ideas. But would it be better off without his presence entirely? I'm not so sure. Neither prophets nor madmen should be elected to the presidency. But neither can they safely be ignored (emphases added).\" Conor Friedersdorf and Glenn Greenwald take a similar position.  Greenwald in particular argues that Paul's positions on foreign policy/national security/civil liberties are so much better than the bipartisan consensus view that Paul's tacit approval of those odious newsletters should be heavily discounted.  As Greenwald puts it, progressives who don't support Paul must apparently accept the following preference ordering: \"Yes, I'm willing to continue to have Muslim children slaughtered by covert drones and cluster bombs, and America's minorities imprisoned by the hundreds of thousands for no good reason, and the CIA able to run rampant with no checks or transparency, and privacy eroded further by the unchecked Surveillance State, and American citizens targeted by the President for assassination with no due process, and whistleblowers threatened with life imprisonment for \"espionage,\" and the Fed able to dole out trillions to bankers in secret, and a substantially higher risk of war with Iran (fought by the U.S. or by Israel with U.S. support) in exchange for less severe cuts to Social Security, Medicare and other entitlement programs, the preservation of the Education and Energy Departments, more stringent environmental regulations, broader health care coverage, defense of reproductive rights for women, stronger enforcement of civil rights for America's minorities, a President with no associations with racist views in a newsletter, and a more progressive Supreme Court.\" I'm of two minds about this line of argument.  On the one hand, there is no denying that Paul's worldview has helped him to launch a powerful critique on American foreign policy.  This can't just be dismissed as \"yes, he was right on Iraq, but...\" either.  As Douthat, Friedersdorf and Greenwald observe, Paul really is the only candidate to bring up these issues (not named Gary Johnson or Jon Hunstman.) His hypothesis that the United States has invited some blowback by overly militarizing its foreign policy cannot be easily dismissed. Think of it this way:  Paul is a hedgehog.  He knows One Big Thing and uses it to construct his worldview.  We know from Philip Tetlock that hedgehogs are less likely to be right when making predictions than foxes \u2014 those people who know a little about a lot of things. Hedgehogs outperform foxes is in getting big macro-consequential events correct, however.  We tend to ignore such predictions, however, because hedgehogs usually lack the emotional intelligence necessary to persuade nonbelievers.  I  want Paul banging on about the dangers of excessive government intrusion and overexpansion.  That's not nothing. Here's the thing, though \u2014 precisely because Paul is a hedgehog, he brings other less-than-desirable qualities to the table.  I don't think his intriguing take on foreign policy and civil liberties can be separated from, say, his totally-insane views about the Federal Reserve.  In fact, let me just edit Greenwald's proposed tradeoff so that it's a bit more accurate: \"Yes, I'm willing to continue to have some Muslim children inadvertently die by covert drones and cluster bombs, and a disproportionate percentage of America's minorities imprisoned for no good reason, and the CIA taking action with minimal checks or transparency, and privacy eroded further by the unchecked Surveillance State, and American citizens targeted by the President for assassination with no due process, and whistleblowers threatened with life imprisonment for \"espionage,\" and the Fed able to dole out trillions to bankers and lots of rhetoric & covert action against Iran that makes Glenn Greenwald hyperventilate in exchange for avoiding a complete and total meltdown of the global economy due to the massive deflation that would naturally follow from a re-constituted gold standard.\" I don't like this choice, but it's an easy one to make.

The euphoria of Barack Obama's supporters on election night four years ago was replaced Tuesday by relief, as the incumbent president won a second term over Republican Mitt Romney in an effort powered more by organization than by ideas. To retain the White House, Obama managed to overcome the handicap of an economy just finding its footing after a devastating recession, and an unemployment rate higher than it's been under any president seeking re-election since Franklin Roosevelt during the Great Depression. And in swing states that now serve as pickers of our presidents, Obama and his team orchestrated the larger national economic question into a conversation that focused almost solely on the important automobile industry there and his role in its revival. \"The auto workers really feel that he saved their jobs,\" says Paul Beck, a political scientist at the Ohio State University. Obama won the pivotal state. Results are expected to show him capturing a larger segment \u2014 though perhaps not a majority \u2014 of the working-class white vote than his national average. Romney's last-ditch attempt to sour the issue by running an ad that misleadingly, at best, claimed Jeep was moving jobs out of Ohio backfired. Says Beck: \"He should have just left the auto issue alone.\" By The Numbers Obama's victory in starkly divided America was a study in maniacal, years-long, state-level preparation. It was aided by having an opponent who was fatally hobbled by damage inflicted during a long and harsh GOP primary season, and who seemed unable or unwilling to reach out to voters who weren't in the Republicans' most reliable but fading national demographic: aging, married white people. With his own fellow Republicans casting Romney as a \"vulture capitalist\" for his time at Bain Capital, and a \"liar\" for his evolving positions on issues ranging from abortion and gay rights to health care reform, Obama simply built on what the GOP began. \"Obama essentially framed the election as a choice, not a referendum,\" says George C. Edwards III, author of Governing by Campaigning. \"His message was that, 'You may not like me, but Romney's a risky choice; he's out of touch.' \" \"It's easy to overdetermine election results,\" Edwards says, \"but the one thing that was very successful was their definition of Romney in the summer after the Republican primaries.\" Sure, Romney displayed other shortcomings. His awkward debate syntax suggested he kept women in \"binders.\" His lackluster nominating convention was overtaken by an aged Hollywood actor addressing an empty chair. A leaked videotape from a fundraiser captured him dismissing \"47 percent\" of Americans as seeing themselves as \"victims\" unable to \"take personal responsibility and care for their lives.\" And his party offered up Tea Party Senate candidates, Todd Akin in Missouri, and Richard Mourdock in Indiana, whose comments on women and rape allowed Democrats to emphasize the divide on women's health and reproductive issues. But Obama was not always playing from a position of power, despite his incumbency. He turned in a widely panned first debate performance. Saw his \"you didn't build that\" phrase taken out of context and used to fuel the GOP convention. And a U.S. ambassador and three other Americans were murdered in Libya on Sept. 11. What Turned It Former President Bill Clinton's riveting speech at Obama's nominating convention, and his subsequent campaigning, helped define the president's first term in a way Obama had not. Hurricane Sandy allowed Obama, in the waning days of the campaign, to break from a negative campaign and look presidential overseeing relief efforts with New Jersey's GOP Gov. Chris Christie. Samuel Popkin, author of The Candidate: What it takes to Win \u2014 and Hold \u2014 the White House, says he is also convinced that the president's decision to suspend deportations of young people brought to this country illegally as children helped him immeasurably with the growing Latino community. And that his embrace of same-sex marriage brought more important voters, and donors, into the fold. \"You're talking about a re-election, not a first election here,\" Popkin said. \"This is not a wedding night \u2014 this is a renewal of vows.\" But, perhaps more important than any of the above is that the ceremony could not have been more carefully orchestrated. The planning started back in 2008 when Obama became the nation's first African-American president. \"The Obama campaign realized better than any other campaign that elections aren't about one big thing anymore,\" says Sasha Issenberg, author of The Victory Lab: The Secret Science of Winning Campaigns. \"Part of that is we have much better tools now to isolate the impact of individual interactions between a campaign and voters, and lots of data that allows us to segment the voters themselves.\" Issenberg argues that the Obama campaign took those tools, including the application of social science insights and experiments, and, with the gift of four years to perfect its operation, \"used them better than any other political enterprise in history.\" With a polarized electorate, the campaigns, he says, saw no need to focus on big, persuasive messages or to drive a major change in public opinion. They needed to figure out how to get their electorate out and use their targeting tools to find more voters in perhaps unexpected places. The Obama campaign had four years to think like an organization, think like a corporation, test strategies, and then invest resources that would find, persuade and motivate voters, says Issenberg, a columnist for Slate.com. Bottom line, he says, Obama and the Democrats outran Republicans in the increasingly sophisticated game of finding voters, communicating with them, and getting them to the polls. No Big Ideas Issenberg is correct. It wasn't a campaign that involved the selling of big ideas, though size-of-government arguments ostensibly defined the contest. For Kathleen Hall Jamieson, director of the Annenberg Public Policy Center at the University of Pennsylvania, that was an enormous disappointment. It was a campaign marked by both sides attempting to capitalize on comments taken out of context, she said, by outright lies by candidates and their surrogates, and by failure to address the realities of an economy that needs fixing. \"They didn't have the courage to tell us what we'd have to do because they believe we're not mature enough,\" she says. \"They're wrong.\" Obama may have played it safe because behind the scenes, from Ohio to Iowa, Colorado and back to New Hampshire, the four-year plan was working. Exit polls suggested that nationally, Obama retained the same level of support from demographic groups that fueled his 2008 victory, including blacks, Latinos and young voters. \"It's amazing how little movement there actually was in this campaign,\" Issenberg says. \"Voters pick their teams early, and neither of these candidates saw their paths to victory as challenging that divide, or building a new coalition.\" \"They ran incredibly modest campaigns,\" he said. Albeit ones that, when the outside money is counted, will end up costing on the order of $6 billion.",

The euro crisis is one of several issues that came up little, if at all, during the U.S. presidential debates. It's possible that the presidential debates will be remembered mainly for trivia \u2014 Big Bird, binders and bayonets. But Mitt Romney and President Obama did discuss issues of paramount importance, including taxes, entitlements and the role the U.S. should play in the Middle East. Those issues \u2014 and above all else, the economy \u2014 dominated discussion throughout the debate season. That meant other important topics such as immigration were barely mentioned, while others never came up at all. To some extent, Romney and Obama had to respond to the topics moderators were most interested in. Still, they managed to talk about any issue they wanted \u2014 especially during Monday's foreign policy debate, in which domestic issues were discussed repeatedly and at some length. Here are a few topics that were not touched on at all over the course of their three debates: Climate Change Climate has been a staple of presidential debates since 2000 and was a regular feature of vice presidential debates even earlier. But climate change was never mentioned in any debate this year. The issue had gained resonance this summer after a series of powerful storms and widespread drought. CNN's Candy Crowley, who moderated last week's town hall-style debate, said there was a question about climate ready to go from the audience, but \"we knew that the economy was still the main thing.\" Romney criticized Obama's spending on clean energy companies more than once, while Obama criticized Romney, during last week's debate, for his bragging that as governor of Massachusetts he shut down coal-powered plants. But neither addressed climate change directly. \"The president as a matter of foreign policy will be called upon to engage with climate change with other countries around the world,\" says Angela Anderson, the head of the energy and climate program at the Union of Concerned Scientists, which advocates policies to address climate change. \"There is a real confusion on the part of two campaigns in how to talk about this in a way that doesn't polarize the issue further,\" she says. The Eurozone Through much of the spring, there was a lot of talk about how Obama's chances for re-election rested largely on the shoulders of Angela Merkel, the chancellor of Germany. The U.S. economy could be put at risk by a serious failure of the economies within the eurozone. Things have calmed down on that front. \"There was a change of heart in Germany about forcing Greece out of the euro, at least right now,\" says Desmond Lachman, a resident fellow at the American Enterprise Institute. \"This kept Greece out of world headlines and took away an issue that Romney might have more forcefully exploited.\" Still, as Lachman points out, Romney did warn that the U.S. could go the way of Greece if Obama's policies were continued. But neither candidate talked about how the continuing struggles of Europe could affect the U.S. economy. And Obama didn't try to point to the European recession as a warning of where Romney's policies of austerity might lead the U.S. Campaign Finance This is the first presidential campaign since Watergate in which neither candidate is accepting public financing of his campaign. Perhaps it's not altogether surprising, then, that campaign finance did not come up in the debates. \"Who wants to draw attention to the fact that Obama has raised more money than any candidate in history, and Romney is doing everything he can to keep up?\" says Meredith McGehee, policy director for the Campaign Legal Center, which supports campaign finance restrictions. McGehee suggests that the Supreme Court's decision in Citizens United, which allowed direct corporate spending on campaigns and indirectly opened the door to free-spending superPACs, may have left the candidates with limited policymaking opportunities to discuss. Still, even if Obama might have been open to charges of \"hypocrisy\" had he decried the influence of big money in politics, as McGehee suggests, it's a little surprising that he didn't seek a chance to exploit the issue. \"It fits the Obama campaign's narrative about Romney nicely, that he's this out-of-touch plutocrat,\" says Michael Dorf, a Cornell University law professor. \"If he's benefiting from multimillion-dollar donations, that's a good line of attack.\" Gay Rights Gay rights have been a major issue during Obama's presidency, from his signing of a bill to allow gays to serve openly in the military to his announcement this spring that he supports same-sex marriage. The fact that these issues were entirely absent from the presidential debates itself constitutes a victory, says Fred Sainz, vice president of Human Rights Campaign, a gay-rights group. \"It is a measure of progress in terms of how far the LBGT issue has come in that it is no longer an issue,\" says Sainz, referring to the lesbian, bisexual, gay and transgendered community. He notes that public support of gay rights has grown enormously over the past decade, with even gay marriage \u2014 which was a potent tool for President George W. Bush in 2004 \u2014 now enjoying bare majority support in polls. \"Gov. Romney stays away from the issue like I stay away from five-day-old tuna fish salad,\" Sainz says. Of course, support for gay rights \u2014 and gay marriage in particular \u2014 is far from universal. Obama's statement of support for gay marriage came a day after voters in North Carolina approved a constitutional ban on the practice. Gay marriage has never been approved by voters, while it's been banned by voters in 32 states. On Nov. 6, voters in Washington state, Maine and Maryland will vote whether to allow gay marriages, while Minnesota voters will decide whether to approve a ban. \"Same-sex-marriage advocates are wrong when they suggest that gay marriage is inevitable throughout the United States,\" says Chip White, spokesman for Preserve Marriage Washington, which is opposing the gay-marriage measure in Washington state. The Supreme Court The possibility of appointments to the Supreme Court is typically an underdiscussed issue in presidential campaigns. Still, it's notable that none of the moderators asked Obama or Romney about it, as there have been four new justices appointed since 2005, while four of the current justices are each at least 74 years old. It's possible that the candidates' own reticence had something to do with the fact that discussing Supreme Court picks might have brought up all manner of controversial topics, including same-sex marriage, affirmative action and abortion. Obama was eager during the debates to present himself as a champion of women and reproductive rights. But neither he nor Romney ever uttered the word \"abortion.\" (Abortion was raised during the vice presidential debate.) \"The risk for Obama in reminding women that Roe could be overturned is that creates an opening for Romney to say that you could lose your gun rights if you get some more Democratic appointees,\" says Dorf, the Cornell professor, who was a clerk for Justice Anthony Kennedy. Dorf notes that Romney presented a more moderate image during the debates than he had throughout much of the campaign. He may not have wanted to remind voters that he would very likely appoint conservative justices. \"Each of them would be likely to nominate justices who will take positions on some things that will be unpopular with a majority of Americans,\" Dorf says.",

For third-party candidates, getting into a presidential debate is practically impossible. What's it like to be a third-party candidate running for president? Ralph Nader can tell us. \"You're excluded from the debates,\" he says. \"You spend an exhausting amount of time, until Labor Day, trying to get over the ballot access barriers. Your petitioners are harassed in the streets; you're subjected to baseless lawsuits by one party or another.\" Nader has run for president three times \u2013 four if you count the time he ran unofficially. In 2000, he managed to win almost 3 percent of the national vote. To this day, getting a third-party candidate into a presidential debate is practically impossible. The Commission on Presidential Debates says to be included, you have to poll 15 percent with voters. That's why George Farah, founder of Open Debates, a group that wants the system reformed, thinks the commission is the main problem. \"This commission exists for the principal purpose of protecting and strengthening the two parties,\" Farah says. \"And every four years they allow the major party candidates to negotiate agreements that dictate many of the terms of the debates \u2014 including the exclusion of popular third-party voices.\" So given the two major party candidates had 90 minutes and at least 50 million viewers for their debate last Wednesday, we decided to invite two of the third-party candidates to a debate of our own. Gary Johnson is the Libertarian Party's nominee. Jill Stein is the Green Party's nominee. They joined moderator \u2014 and host of weekends on All Things Considered \u2014 Guy Raz for a debate focusing on domestic issues: the economy, health care and the role of government. \"Country's in deep doo-doo. Let's stop the growing police state, let's stop our military interventions, let's balance the federal budget, let's eliminate income tax, corporate tax, let's abolish the IRS, let's replace all that with one federal consumption tax \u2014 that will create tens of millions of jobs in a zero-corporate tax rate environment.\" \"Well, we are in crisis. We're losing our jobs, decent wages, our homes, affordable health care and higher education; civil liberties are under attack and the climate's in meltdown. The wealthy few are doing better than ever, and the political establishment's making it worse, imposing austerity on everyday people while they squander trillions on wars, Wall Street bailouts and tax breaks for the wealthy. \"A vote for me is a vote for the solutions that we need for jobs, not corporate tax breaks, for health care as a human right, public higher education that's free, ending student debt, and downsizing the military to pay for it.\" Stein: \"The economy is working great if you're a hedge fund manager or a big CEO or a bank, but it's not working for everyday people, so we need to, first and foremost, create jobs. We're calling for a Green New Deal that will create 25 million new jobs that will jumpstart a green new economy and put an end to unemployment \u2014 and that will call a halt to climate change and make wars for oil obsolete, because we'll have a green economy.\" Johnson: \"I think we need to balance the federal budget immediately, or we're going to find ourselves in the midst of a monetary collapse, so I am promising to submit a balanced budget to Congress in the year 2013, which is $1.4 trillion reduction in federal spending \u2013 and that would include the entitlements: Medicaid, Medicare, military spending. \"I would eliminate income tax, corporate tax. I would abolish the IRS; I would replace all of that with one federal consumption tax \u2014 the fair tax. I think that's the answer when it comes to American jobs, because in a zero-corporate rate environment, if the private sector doesn't create tens of millions of jobs-- [called for time]\" Stein: \"We need to simply bring the eligibility age for Medicare down to 0, in fact, pre-0, from the moment of conception, so that people would be covered throughout life and from the very beginning of pregnancy, because in doing that we can cover everyone, comprehensively, including your teeth and your ears and your eyes and your pharmaceuticals and your mental health and your reproductive health and all those things that get chopped out. \"We can cover it all and still save trillions of dollars over the coming decade because a Medicare-for-all plan actually reduces the incredible, massive, wasteful private health insurance bureaucracy, puts all our health care dollars into health care, and it reduces that inflation that's driving up the cost.\" Johnson: \"Well first of all, I would not have insurance to cover myself for ongoing medical need. If we had a genuine free-market approach to health care \u2014 and by the way, health care in this country is about as far removed from free market as it possibly could be \u2014 but I would have insurance to cover myself for catastrophic injury and illness, and I would pay-as-you-go in a system that was absolutely competitive. \"What about government embarking on the notion of doubling the number of doctors as opposed to restricting all the choices that we have? This is what's leading to high costs and the fact that we don't have a whole bunch of choices, when a whole bunch of choices could exist.\" [Guy Raz: \"So you would repeal Obamacare?\"] \"That, and I would also repeal the Republicans' Medicaid part D \u2013 prescription health care benefits. Look, the alternative to not reigning in these costs is we're going to suffer a monetary collapse. And a monetary collapse is when the money that we have doesn't buy a thing because of the accompanying inflation that is going to go along with borrowing and printing money to the tune of 43 cents out of every dollar that we're spending.\" Johnson: \"Government has a role to protect us against individuals, groups, corporations that would do us harm. Government has a role to protect us against foreign countries that would attack this country. But I use the notion of \"under attack\" \u2013 we are, we continually militarily intervene and as a result of that we have hundreds of millions of enemies to this country that but for these military interventions would otherwise not exist.\" Stein: \"Yes, we should. We need to use what has worked before, and we've been in an economic crisis before in the Great Depression. And one of the ways we came out was through the New Deal, which went a long way to get the economy back on its feet. I think we're in trouble now, and the role of government, I think, is to help us, to help We The People. \"We need a government of, by and for the people, not of, by and for the corporations \u2013 there's way too much corporations running the show in government \u2013 but the solution for a bad, corrupt government is not no government, it's good government.\" \"Whether you vote for Mitt Romney or Barack Obama, I'm going to offer up a couple predictions. One is we're going to continue to have a heightened police state in this country. The other is that we're going to find ourselves in a continued state of military intervention; we are at continuous war with everyone. And then, lastly, we're going to find ourselves \u2014 regardless of which two of these guys gets elected \u2014 we're going to find ourselves continuing to borrow and spend money in ways that are absolutely unsustainable and if we don't get control of this, we are going to collapse as a country. We are not immune from the mathematics of continuing to borrow and print money to the tune of 43 cents out of every dollar we spend.\" \"Well, I agree with Gary that we are really headed in the wrong direction \u2013 and in fact, we are accelerating in the wrong direction under both parties. And in fact, Barack Obama has basically embraced most of the key policies of George Bush on the bailouts for Wall Street, the layoffs for Main Street, the expanding free trade agreements that offshore our jobs and undermine wages at home; the expanding wars, the attack on our civil liberties, drill-baby-drill on the climate, you name it. We're going in the wrong direction. We need a president \u2014 we need a political party, that is of, by and for the people. If you go into the voting booth, and you cast a vote for either Wall Street-sponsored candidate, you are giving them a mandate for four more years of the same.\"",

Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney appears a man under siege. His political strategists are feuding over the direction of the campaign. He bungled his \"presidential moment\" with an ill-timed and ill-informed response to violence in Libya that led to the death of a U.S. ambassador and three other Americans. And just as his campaign moved Monday to refocus its message in the wake of a poll showing him losing ground to President Obama on the issue of the economy, a video surfaced purporting to show Romney joking at a fundraiser that he'd have a better chance of winning if his grandparents were Mexican. But while Democrats are licking their chops, and many Republicans are despairing at the state of the Romney campaign just seven weeks from Election Day, the more dispassionate among us suggest that the more things change, the more they stay the same. \"It's still a fluid, very competitive race,\" says Nathan Gonzales, of the nonpartisan Rothenberg Political Report, which analyzes political races. \"Anyone who says they know who is going to win doesn't.\" A national poll bounce that Obama got from the recent Democratic convention continues to dissipate. The eight tossup states that will ultimately decide the race remain nail-biters, though Obama is showing increasing strength in two \u2014 including the electoral vote-rich Ohio. There are two more jobs reports due before Nov. 6 and three presidential debates next month. And despite Romney's much criticized response to the violence in the Middle East, it's not yet clear how continuing unrest there and in North Africa might affect the president's stature. \"The caution I continue to make is that things continue to change,\" says Frank Newport, editor-in-chief at Gallup. \"It is still too early to make predictions, even though many people want to.\" Bounce Recedes, But Approval Improves Gallup's daily presidential tracking poll showed that Obama improved his national lead over Romney with each day of the Democratic convention, reaching a 7-point advantage by the time the party closed up shop in Charlotte on Sept. 6. Romney got no bounce out of the Republican convention the week before in Tampa. But since then, when Obama held a 50-43 percent national lead, his bounce has shrunk. Monday, Gallup had Obama favored by 48 percent of those polled, Romney by 45 percent. \"It appears to be settling down to where it began before the conventions,\" Newport said, noting that people \u2014 many in the media \u2014 \"jumped to the conclusion that the race had been reset.\" \"If these trends continue,\" he said, \"it didn't reset the race.\" Recent Gallup surveys, however, have shown that Obama's approval rating among likely voters has reached 50 percent, a key threshold for incumbents. No incumbent president running for re-election in the day of modern polling has ever lost with an approval rating of 50 percent or more going into Election Day. That, coupled with an uptick in the number of people who think the country is moving in the right direction, have some, like Gonzales, waiting to see whether the president has a fundamental advantage going forward. Perhaps the most worrisome news for Republicans was a recent New York Times/CBS News poll that showed Obama had taken away Romney's long-held edge as the candidate \"most likely to restore the economy.\" The same poll also suggested that the Obama campaign had gained the upper hand with voters on whom they most trust to deal with Medicare. Changes in the retirees' health insurance program proposed in Obama's health care overhaul, and by Romney and his running mate, Rep. Paul Ryan of Wisconsin, loom large in the key tossup state of Florida. \"If the country trusts President Obama on the economy more than Mitt Romney, then the game is over,\" Gonzales says. \"I just don't know where the Republicans go from there.\" \"But we want to see more polling, more trends,\" he said. The Times poll, Newport says, was a \"strong one for Obama overall\" and conducted fairly close to the convention, so more survey data will put the numbers in better perspective. \"But this would be good news for Obama if he maintains parity, or beats Romney on the economy,\" Newport says. Debate Opportunity, And Early Voting People will tune into the three presidential debates in October (the first is in two weeks), but their effect on the electorate is expected \u2014 with the emphasis on expected \u2014 to be negligible. \"Debates don't matter until they do,\" Gonzales says. Will a candidate make an exceptional point? Or stumble spectacularly? Unlikely, but possible. \"It will be important for Romney to try and get voters to be more comfortable with him if they don't like where things in the country are headed,\" he said. And Obama? He needs to persuade undecided voters on that right direction/wrong direction question. However, there's another complicating factor in a race where the targets are the handful of undecided voters in Colorado, Florida, Iowa, New Hampshire, Nevada, Ohio, Virginia and Wisconsin. The debates may have historically less significance this year than in past presidential cycles because of early voting. Registered voters in Iowa, for example, can start casting their ballots as early as Sept. 27. That gives both campaigns the opportunity to lock down so-called soft supporters before anything transpires ahead of the election that could change their minds, Gonzales says. Early voters. Swing state polls. Obama approval ratings. And whom voters trust to improve the economy. Those will be more telling in coming weeks than anything candidates may say about abortion, reproductive choice, income brackets or health care, Gonzales predicts. \"As much as we want to dissect where these small numbers of undecided voters are on those issues,\" he said, \"it's going to be a gut feeling. If it is about the issues, you've probably already made up your mind.\"",

            "article_content": "Rep. Todd Akin, R-Mo., and his wife Lulli, talk with reporters last Thursday at the Missouri State Fair in Sedalia, Mo. On Monday, Akin was resisting GOP calls to resign from his Senate race.\n                \n                    \n                    Orlin Wagner/AP\n                    \n                \nhide caption After Republican Rep. Todd Akin's inflammatory comments over the weekend in which he blithely minimized rape-induced pregnancies, there are at least two inescapable questions: 1) What impact will his remark have on his U.S. Senate race in Missouri against Democratic incumbent Sen. Claire McCaskill? 2) And how much will the shockwaves buffet the presidential contest or other races elsewhere? While it's too early to know the answers, it seems safe to say that the earliest damage appears closest to the epicenter. That is, on Akin himself. But there are also clearly risks for Mitt Romney, the all-but-official Republican presidential nominee, and Paul Ryan, his running mate, as Democrats seek to connect Akin's eyebrow-raising views to the GOP's national ticket, framing it all as part of the alleged Republican \"war on women.\" Ensuring that the controversy won't be dying down anytime soon, President Obama weighed into it at a White House press briefing Monday, using Akin to form a contrast between Democrats and Republicans. Less than week after he won the Republican nomination in a three-way race, Akin was being asked repeatedly by high-level fellow Republicans to drop out of the contest. And that's despite his attempt to back away his initial comments. During a Sunday TV interview, Akin said by way of explaining his opposition to abortion, even in instances of rape: \"If it's a legitimate rape, the female body has ways to try to shut that whole thing down.\" Not surprisingly, that unscientific comment resulted in outrage at the Missouri congressman. Responding to a reporter's question on Monday, Obama demonstrated why Akin's comment is a waking nightmare for Republicans: \"The views expressed were offensive. Rape is rape. The idea that we should be parsing and qualifying and slicing what types of rape we're talking about doesn't make sense to the American people. And certainly doesn't make sense to me. So what I think these comments do underscore is why we shouldn't have a bunch of politicians, a majority of whom are men, making health care decisions on behalf of women.\" \"Although these particular comments have led Gov. Romney and other Republicans to distance themselves, I think the underlying notion that we should be making decisions on behalf of women for their health care decisions or qualifying forcible rape versus non-forcible rape, I think those are broader issues. And that is a significant difference in approach between me and the other party ...\" Obama's reference to forcible rape was as much about Ryan, House Republicans and Romney as it was Akin. Last year, Ryan and Akin were among the co-sponsors of unsuccessful legislation that would have narrowed the exception to the ban on federal taxpayer dollars being used to pay for abortions. Their bill would have applied the exception to only \"forcible\" \u2014 but not to \"non-forcible\" \u2014 rape. Such legislation has contributed to the Democratic polling advantage with women voters, an edge Romney has hoped to narrow. So while a growing number of Republicans said they personally found Akin's statement repellant, political exigencies as well demanded a forceful pushback against the Missouri congressman. Sen. Scott Brown, a Massachusetts Republican in a close race himself against Democrat Elizabeth Warren, was among the first elected GOP officials to come out forcefully against Akin, calling on him to give up his party's nomination. \"As a husband and father of two young women, I found Todd Akin's comments about women and rape outrageous, inappropriate and wrong. There is no place in our public discourse for this type of offensive thinking. Not only should he apologize, but I believe Rep. Akin's statement was so far out of bounds that he should resign the nomination for U.S. Senate in Missouri.\" Sen. John Cornyn, R-Texas, who heads the Senate Republicans' effort to win enough seats to take control of that chamber, didn't go as far as Brown. But a Cornyn statement seemed to be nudging, if not pushing, Akin: \"Congressman Akin's statements were wrong, offensive, and indefensible. I recognize that this is a difficult time for him, but over the next twenty-four hours, Congressman Akin should carefully consider what is best for him, his family, the Republican Party, and the values that he cares about and has fought for throughout his career in public service.\" Cornyn mentioned 24 hours because Missouri law gives Akin only until Tuesday at 5 p.m. local time to drop out. Otherwise, his name remains on the ballot. As of this writing, Akin gave no public indication he was close to dropping out. Just the opposite, in fact: During an interview on Mike Huckabee's radio show, Akin, who apologized profusely for his controversial remarks of a day earlier, also struck a defiant note: \"I'm not a quitter. My belief is we're going to move this thing forward. To quote my friend John Paul Jones, I've not yet begun to fight.\" So far, Romney and Ryan haven't gone as far as Brown, though the former Massachusetts governor has noticeably intensified his responses to Akin from his first statement In a Monday morning interview with the National Review Online, Romney said: \"Congressman's Akin comments on rape are insulting, inexcusable, and, frankly, wrong,\" Romney said. \"Like millions of other Americans, we found them to be offensive.\" That was a notable escalation from the campaign's earlier statement from campaign spokeswoman Andrea Saul: \"'Governor Romney and Congressman Ryan disagree with Mr. Akin's statement, and a Romney-Ryan administration would not oppose abortion in instances of rape.\" Republicans with no official party roles joined Brown in calling for Akin's exit. Mike Murphy, a GOP political strategist who advised the campaigns of Romney and Sen. John McCain, tweeted: \"Akin should put good of GOP first and resign nomination now after his idiotic comment. Senate control too important.\" Conservative blogger Michelle Malkin sounded a similar note: \"The question for Republicans in Missouri is whether sticking by self-inflicted-wounded Akin is more important than securing a U.S. Senate majority.\" And that is the question, especially since there is precedent for Republicans who enjoyed polling leads in Senate races against their Democratic rivals, losing not only their leads but the eventual contests because of a misstep. Nate Silver on the FiveThirtyEight blog at the New York Times reminds us of George Allen in Virginia and Peter Hoekstra in Michigan, who both lost Senate races after they needlessly stepped on political landmines. Allen made his infamous \"macaca\" comment aimed at a man of East Asian ancestry; Hoekstra ran an ad featuring an actress who to many seemed to be portraying an Asian stereotype. Silver notes: \"These episodes in Virginia and Michigan, which produced a net swing of about 10 percentage points in the polls against the candidate involved in the controversy, appear as though they may represent fairly typical cases.\" The current Akin episode appeared to further validate the re-election strategy of McCaskill, the Democratic incumbent. During the Republican primary campaign, McCaskill ran TV ads that called Akin the most conservative of the three Republicans in the race. To observers, it appeared she was hoping that would help him win the primary in a state whose Republicans have been trending more conservative in recent elections. Polls that showed her trailing all the Republican candidates showed her trailing Akin by the smallest margin. (Update: At a campaign stop in Festus, Mo., McCaskill said the idea Akin will be forced to step down by GOP insiders in a slap in the face of Missouri voters. Adam Allington of St. Louis Public Radio reported on her comments.) Meanwhile, Akin's comment was proving most unhelpful to Romney and Ryan as it allowed Democrats to increase their attacks on the Republican national ticket. As Politico reported, even before Akin's comments, Democrats had already gone after both Romney and Ryan for opposing women's reproductive rights, including the Supreme Court's 1973 Roe v. Wade decision that legalized abortions. What Akin's comments did was give Democrats fresh material for their argument that they are better on women's issues than Republicans. Lis Smith, an Obama for America spokeswoman, issued the following statement: \"While Mitt Romney and Paul Ryan are working overtime to distance themselves from Rep. Todd Akin's comments on rape, they are contradicting their own records. Mr. Romney supports the Human Life Amendment, which would ban abortion in all instances, even in the case of rape and incest. In fact, that amendment is a central part of the Republican Party's platform that is being voted on tomorrow. And, as a Republican leader in the House, Mr. Ryan worked with Mr. Akin to try to pass laws that would ban abortion in all cases, and even narrow the definition of 'rape.' \"",

The election was over. As President Obama faced the press in the East Room of the White House on Wednesday, the anger and bitterness of his long battle with Mitt Romney seemed to have faded. Unlike President George W. Bush after his 2004 re-election \u2014 and his comments about having political capital and intending to spend it \u2014 Obama seemed a bit more humble victor, talking more about compromise and saying he was willing to hear other points of view to solve the nation's problems. But all the niceties disappeared when he was asked about the apparent decision by Republican Sens. John McCain and Lindsey Graham to block the nomination of Susan Rice to become secretary of state, should Obama decide that she's the one he wants to succeed Hillary Clinton, who is expected to step down soon. The famous Obama casualness quickly disappeared, replaced by anger. First, he reminded everyone that he hadn't made a decision on sec/state. Then came this: \"But let me say specifically about Susan Rice, she has done exemplary work. She has represented the United States and our interests in the United Nations with skill and professionalism and toughness and grace. As I've said before, she made an appearance at the request of the White House in which she gave her best understanding of the intelligence that had been provided to her [regarding the attack of the U.S. consulate in Benghazi, Libya]. If Senator McCain and Senator Graham and others want to go after somebody, they should go after me. And I'm happy to have that discussion with them. But for them to go after the U.N. ambassador, who had nothing to do with Benghazi and was simply making a presentation based on intelligence that she had received and to besmirch her reputation is outrageous. ... \"And I don't think there's any debate in this country that when you have four Americans killed, that's a problem. And we've got to get to the bottom of it, and there needs to be accountability. We've got to bring those who carried it out to justice. They won't get any debate from me on that. \"But when they go after the U.N. ambassador, apparently because they think she's an easy target, then they've got a problem with me. And should I choose \u2014 if I think that she would be the best person to serve America in the capacity \u2014 the State Department, then I will nominate her.\" But Republicans are not backing down, insisting that Rice was part of an administration that attempted to downplay (or mislead) what happened Sept. 11 at the consulate for political purposes. Shortly after Obama's press conference, Graham said in a statement, \"Mr. President, don't think for one minute I don't hold you ultimately responsible for Benghazi. I think you failed as commander in chief before, during and after the attack.\" And as for Rice, he said, \"I have no intention of promoting anyone who is up to their eyeballs in the Benghazi debacle.\" And McCain said he and others will do \"whatever's necessary to block the nomination that's within our power.\" Neither side shows any interest in backing down. Obama feels the Republicans are trying to re-fight an election they already lost, reminiscent of when the president reminded McCain during the February 2010 health-care summit in his famous putdown, \"We are not campaigning anymore. The election's over.\" For their part, Republicans see it as an issue that was glossed over by the president in the hope of not making waves before the Nov. 6 election. It's personal and it's political, and it's hard to separate the two. But Obama's problems regarding Rice may be more than just the opposition of McCain and Graham. She has a habit of expressing her displeasure with her adversaries in less-than-diplomatic ways, and it rankles. The New York Times' Mark Landler writes that the \"firestorm over Benghazi raises more basic questions: Is Ms. Rice the best candidate to succeed Mrs. Clinton as the nation's chief diplomat? Does she have the diplomatic finesse to handle thorny problems in the Middle East? And even if Mr. Obama gets the votes for her confirmation, has the episode so tainted her that it would be hard for her to thrive in the job?\" Some wonder if Obama \"would risk a battle over his secretary of state when he needs to cut a deal with Republicans on the budget and taxes.\" The Washington Post's Dana Milbank piles on even further, writing that she \"is ill-equipped to be the nation's top diplomat for reasons that have little to do with Libya\": \"Even in a town that rewards sharp elbows and brusque personalities, Rice has managed to make an impressive array of enemies \u2014 on Capitol Hill, in Foggy Bottom and abroad. Particularly in comparison with the other person often mentioned for the job, Sen. John Kerry, she can be a most undiplomatic diplomat, and there likely aren't enough Republican or Democratic votes in the Senate to confirm her. ... \"Among those she has insulted is the woman she would replace at State. Rice was one of the first former Clinton administration officials to defect to Obama's primary campaign against Hillary Clinton. Rice condemned Clinton's Iraq and Iran positions, asking for an 'explanation of how and why she got those critical judgments wrong.' ... \"Rice's put-down of Clinton was tame compared with her portrayal of McCain during 2008, which no doubt contributes to McCain's hostility toward her today. She mocked McCain's trip to Iraq ('strolling around the market in a flak jacket'), called his policies 'reckless' and said 'his tendency is to shoot first and ask questions later. It's dangerous.' \"It was Rice's own shoot-first tendency that caused her to be benched as a spokesman for the Obama campaign for a time in 2008. She unnerved European allies when she denounced as 'counterproductive' and 'self-defeating' the U.N. policy that Iran suspend its nuclear program before talks can begin. She criticized President George W. Bush and McCain because they 'insisted' on it. ... \"Compared with this, the flap over Libya is relatively minor \u2014 but revealing. It's true that, in her much-criticized TV performance, she was reciting talking points given to her by the intelligence agencies. But that's the trouble. Rice stuck with her points even though they had been contradicted by the president of the Libyan National Assembly, who, on CBS's Face the Nation just before Rice, said there was 'no doubt' that the attack on Americans in Benghazi 'was preplanned.' Rice rebutted the Libyan official, arguing \u2014 falsely, it turned out \u2014 that there was no evidence of such planning. \"True, Rice was following orders from the White House, which she does well. But the nation's top diplomat needs to show more sensitivity and independence \u2014 traits Clinton has demonstrated in abundance. Obama can do better at State than Susan Rice.\" Some Republicans are betting that Obama won't push for a Rice nomination if it could jeopardize negotiations with the GOP on things like the budget, or immigration. But the Obama they are describing may be the one from the first term. Wary of trying to appease the opposition and aware that his base is not in a negotiating mood, Obama may instead decide to fight hard for her. And some in the GOP, still in some disbelief that they lost an election they thought they should have won, are welcoming that fight. (One lingering thought regarding the Obama press conference: Didn't his defense of Rice remind you of \"President\" Michael Douglas defending his girlfriend against \"GOP Senate Leader\" Richard Dreyfuss in the movie The American President?

Davis lost the Empire State by more than 26 points. But he never ran for office in New York, so that may not be a fair comparison. Perhaps a better example is Adlai Stevenson. In 1956, when Stevenson, the former governor of Illinois, ran and lost in a rematch with President Dwight Eisenhower, he got clobbered in his home state by 19 percentage points. Thus, Romney's 23-point deficit in Massachusetts breaks that record. Others since 1924 who lost their home states where they once served in other office: Al Gore 2000 (D-Tenn.), George McGovern 1972 (D-S.D.), Stevenson 1952 (D-Ill.), Thomas Dewey 1944 (R-N.Y.)*, Alf Landon 1936 (R-Kan.), and Al Smith 1928 (D-N.Y.). *Dewey lost to a fellow New Yorker, President Franklin Roosevelt. One incumbent president, Woodrow Wilson, lost New Jersey \u2014 where he once served as governor \u2014 to Republican Charles Evans Hughes in 1916 by more than 11 points. But Wilson won re-election that year. Q: As I write this, votes are still being counted in the election for the Senate seat in Arizona. The chances of Richard Carmona coming from behind to win it all are slim, but let's say he does. Since he already conceded the race, does that stand? Has it ever happened before (aside from 2000 presidential election) where a candidate conceded, and then after the dust settled, s/he went on to win? \u2014 Gabriel Zilnik, Raleigh, N.C. A: Conceding only means you are stating the obvious: that it appears the election cannot be won. It's usually a gracious way of congratulating a victorious opponent. Carmona conceded the race to Rep. Jeff Flake (R) on election night. But as the counting of votes continues, the margin is just under 4 percent (Flake's 49.61 percent to Carmona's 45.80 percent), with an estimated 163,482 ballots still to be counted. If, for argument's sake, all the remaining votes went to Carmona, he would be the winner, concession or not. Conceding the election does not supersede the actual vote totals. A concession has no legal standing. Al Gore, as you alluded, conceded on election night 2000, only to \"take it back\" when Florida went from Bush to undecided. Ultimately, of course, he conceded once more \u2014 on Dec. 13. Q: I heard somewhere that the total votes for Democrats running for the House this year exceeded the number of votes received by Republicans. Is that true? If so, it would seem a good talking point for the president when Mr. Boehner argues that the people elected the House they did to protect the country from Obama. \u2014 Robert R. Nesbit Jr., Augusta, Ga. A: The way to get a majority in the House is by winning at least 218 seats, not by getting the most votes cast nationally. But, having said that, voters did give Democratic candidates for the House some 1 million votes more than they did for Republicans. Bloomberg News' Greg Giroux breaks it down even further in Businessweek: \"Democrats led Republicans by 56 million to 55 million votes nationally, according to unofficial tallies from The Associated Press. It's the first time since 1996 that one party won more House seats while winning fewer votes, according to data compiled by the House Clerk's office. The outcome is the product in part of Republican-dominated redrawing of House seat boundaries after the 2010 census and of population shifts. \"In North Carolina, Republican candidates garnered a total of 2.14 million votes in the 13 districts, winning nine. Democrats gained a total of 2.22 million votes, winning three districts and leading in a fourth. \"In Pennsylvania, Republicans won 13 of the 18 districts even as they lost the aggregate vote by 2.7 million to 2.6 million.\" And speaking of total votes, this note came in from Phil Chronakis of Hoboken, N.J.: \"You said in your post-election column that the 'two-point-plus spread [of Obama over Romney] made it the fifth closest presidential election in more than a century, trailing only Kennedy-Nixon 1960, Bush-Gore 2000, Nixon-Humphrey 1968 and Carter-Ford 1976.' \"I submit that the Bush-Kerry 2004 election was also closer in the popular vote count (as measured by percentage) than last week's election. The percentage spread in 2004 was 2.46% in Bush's favor (50.73% to Kerry's 48.27%). The percentage spread in 2012, was 2.85% in Obama's favor (50.61% to Romney's 47.76%). Thus, 2012 becomes the SIXTH closest election in more than a century (or since 1888).\" Q: I hope I'm not the only one wondering if my vote is private, or if, like the Census Bureau, our votes get tabulated somewhere besides the ballot box. I ask this because I wonder where writers, such as yourself, find statistical evidence that states, for example: \"Obama won women by 11 points. He took 71 percent of Latinos, 73 percent of Asians, 93 percent of blacks. Sixty percent of voters under 30. Once upon a time, winning the white vote by a 61-39 percentage \u2014 as Romney did \u2014 would be enough for victory. Those days may be gone.\" Where do you get this information? How is it collected? Is it a nonpartisan polling effort, or something a little more sinister? \u2014 Duane Magoon, Anchorage, Alaska A: Nothing sinister. All of the demographic information \u2014 about gender and ethnicity and income and age and party preference, etc. \u2014 is compiled through exit polls conducted by Edison Research, a polling and survey company that tabulates this for members of their media clients (TV & radio networks and newspapers). Q: The scenario in your Oct. 29 column \u2014 that Elizabeth Warren gets appointed to the Senate seat of Secretary of State-designate John Kerry \u2014 is of course now moot. She won. As to your point that it was unlikely for Gov. Deval Patrick to appoint a losing Senate candidate to a Senate seat: In 1946 Republican Henry Dworshak was elected to the Senate from Idaho to serve the last two years of the late John Thomas' term. In 1948, running for a full term, Dworshak was defeated by Bert Miller, who became a 69-year-old freshman in January 1949 and died in October. His appointed replacement was . . . Henry Dworshak, who kept the seat until his own death in 1962. \u2014 Jeff Rundell, Seattle, Wash. A: Good stuff, thanks for this. You sound like, um, a political junkie. Time for three more post-election comments that arrived in the in-box: Jeani Rector of West Sacramento, Calif: \"I liked your nice and interesting analysis of the Romney defeat (see Nov. 12 Political Junkie, 'Who Gets the Blame for the Romney Loss? The Tea Party has an Idea.'). But for all the reasons given, I think it cannot be overstated: It was the women vote. Speaking as a woman, I can tell you that we reject the idea that Republicans want to force their fanatical religious and reproductive rights views on us. ... There are also the issues of appointments to the Supreme Court and the plan to defund Planned Parenthood. ... Also, many women believe that the GOP only cares about children BEFORE they are born. Afterwards, not so much. ... I cheer when the tea party extremists say that the reason Romney lost was because he was 'too moderate.' As a Democrat, I hope that the Tea Party doubles down on their fanaticism. Doing so would continue to drive the Republican Party into extinction. Remember: we women are watching. And voting.\" Anne Franklin of Garfield, N.J.: \"I voted for Obama and I am relieved the election is over. Romney was the least sympathetic candidate I've ever seen. And that's a shame, because I'm no Obama fan. The president's attacks on Romney were relentless, many of them were truly mean spirited and personal, and I actually hesitated when I went into the voting booth. I take my vote very seriously, and while there was never a chance Romney would get it, I almost walked out of there and left the presidential vote blank. I don't know what message Obama got from the election, but it certainly wasn't a vote of confidence to continue all that negativity.\" And Randy Baker in Springfield, Mo.: \"When the Republicans decide to run a Republican and not a RINO then they will win again. Someone with gonads, who doesn't put his finger in the wind. Until then: Libertarian it is! Frankly, it won't happen. There are too many on the left and right now with their hands out for their latest government trinket. Romney was right to a degree but it isn't 47% \u2014 it's more like 75%+ to one degree or another. Oh, so factual and sad!\" Political Junkie segment on Talk of the Nation.

Reagan says the unsuccessful attempt may have been a \"high-risk gamble,\" but it wasn't a \"fiasco or a great failure of any kind.\" But Congress, which was kept in the dark about the effort, was furious, and Secretary of State George Shultz opposed the idea from the beginning (Nov. 19, 1986).

            "article_content": "Indiana Republican Senate candidate Richard Mourdock holds a news conference Wednesday in Indianapolis to address his comments about rape and abortion.\n                \n                    \n                    Michael Conroy/AP\n                    \n                \nhide caption Indiana Republican Senate candidate Richard Mourdock holds a news conference Wednesday in Indianapolis to address his comments about rape and abortion. The enthusiasm with which Democrats seized upon Senate candidate Richard Mourdock's philosophizing about God's plan for unborn children of women impregnated by rape may have suggested the Indiana Republican's election chances had just ended. And, in the favored Democratic scenario, a Mourdock self-destruct would mean that the GOP's dreams of taking control of the U.S. Senate would once again be significantly hobbled by a Tea Party candidate. (See: Christine O'Donnell of Delaware and Sharron Angle of Nevada in 2010.) Not so fast, say race analysts. Though President Obama already has incorporated Mourdock's comments into his stump message on women's health care and choice, it's too early to tell how they will play in the Republican's dead-heat race with Indiana Democratic Rep. Joe Donnelly. Or whether they'll resonate, as Democrats hope, in the presidential race and tightening Senate races beyond Indiana. \"We just don't know yet,\" says Jennifer Duffy, who analyzes Senate races for the nonpartisan Cook Political Report. \"While it would be nice to do this instant analysis, anyone who is putting a marker down on this is nuts.\" Republican chances for a Senate takeover remain alive, although they are slim, to be sure. The Senate now is made up of 51 Democrats, 47 Republicans, and two independents who caucus with the Democrats. The GOP needs to gain four seats to control the Senate if Obama wins; three seats if Republican Mitt Romney emerges the presidential victor on Nov. 6. But it is still \"too early to count chickens,\" wrote Stuart Rothenberg at the nonpartisan Rothenberg Political Report. Nathan Gonzales, also at the Rothenberg Political Report, says that Republicans have to win eight of nine races that he and analysts at his organization have rated as broad tossups. Those races include three currently held by Republicans: Indiana; Massachusetts, where Sen. Scott Brown is facing a fierce challenge from Democrat Elizabeth Warren; and Nevada, where Sen. Dean Heller is neck and neck with Democratic Rep. Shelly Berkley. \"Obviously, in order to gain seats, Republicans need to hold as many of their own as possible,\" Gonzales says, even as they are expected to gain seats in Nebraska and North Dakota, where longtime Democratic senators are retiring. Other states where Senate races are considered tossups by Rothenberg are in Montana, Virginia, Wisconsin and Connecticut. If Republicans lose Indiana and Massachusetts, where Warren has consistently been polling ahead, \"all they've done is hold even,\" Gonzales says. \"That's where the trouble lies.\" Republicans are expected to lose Maine, where GOP Sen. Olympia Snowe is retiring. Democrats, whose own candidate is not considered competitive, have put money into attacking Republican Charlie Summers in the hopes of bolstering the independent candidate, former Gov. Angus King. Democrats expect King to caucus with them in the Senate, though he has not publicly committed to doing so. \"Democrats have done a good job getting candidates in position to take advantage of opportunities that are there,\" says Gonzales, pointing to longtime moderate Republican Sen. Richard Lugar's loss to Mourdock in the Indiana primary as an example. \"A lot of this is the hand that you're dealt, and the Republicans are now dealing Democrats some good cards.\" Gonzales adds: \"The Tea Party has complicated Republican efforts to regain the Senate majority, but you're dealing with a group of conservatives for which the majority isn't even a priority.\" \"For them,\" he said, \"purity is better than a majority.\" Mourdock: Slowed, But Not Finished? In a debate this week, Mourdock said he doesn't think abortion should be a legal option even after a rape: \"Even when life begins in that horrible situation of rape, that it is something that God intended to happen,\" said Mourdock. \"What [Mourdock] said was not well-said,\" Duffy acknowledges, \"but there are a lot of people on the pro-life spectrum who share his view, that a life is a life no matter how it's conceived.\" Missouri Senate candidates Republican Todd Akin and incumbent Democratic Sen. Claire McCaskill debate in Columbia, Mo., on Sept. 21.\n                \n                    \n                    Sarah Conrad/Reuters/Landov\n                    \n                \nhide caption Missouri Senate candidates Republican Todd Akin and incumbent Democratic Sen. Claire McCaskill debate in Columbia, Mo., on Sept. 21. She noted that the Democrat Donnelly in the Indiana race has a strong anti-abortion record, too, and \"can't go all in on this issue.\" Mourdock's comments aren't comparable, she says, to Missouri GOP Senate candidate Todd Akin's earlier musings on \"legitimate rape.\" \"This is different \u2014 Mourdock didn't try to be a biology professor,\" Duffy says, referring to Akin's suggestion that women can shut down their reproductive system to avoid pregnancy during rape. \"Akin has also said ridiculous things every day since.\" Akin appears on course to lose in a close race to Sen. Claire McCaskill, once considered the Democratic Senate incumbent most vulnerable to defeat. So Mourdock is not necessarily cooked. Romney is standing by him, as are other conservatives \u2014 even as Obama criticized what he characterized as Mourdock's parsing of rape, and male politicians \"making decisions about women's health care\" choices. Timing Is Everything Before Mourdock's comments, the thinking was that he was gaining his footing and that an expected Romney victory in Indiana would very likely pull the Senate candidate across the finish line a winner. It still might, and how strong Romney runs in other states with tossup Senate races could do more to decide the upper chamber's balance than any comments on rape. Republicans have been tantalizingly close to seizing control of the U.S. Senate in recent years, only to see those dreams dashed by a combination of the party's rightward push and inferior candidates. This was to be the year they did it, and, while it's been complicated by Mourdock and Akin \u2014 as complicated as Romney's swing state path to the presidency \u2014 neither are impossible. Says Duffy: \"Every day matters.\"",

            "article_content": "Winchester, Va., is predominantly Republican, and the surrounding county favored John McCain in the 2008 presidential election. But it's part of a state where public opinion appears to increasingly favor Democrats. Guest host Linda Wertheimer reports on the political landscape.  LINDA WERTHEIMER, HOST: President Barack Obama has pulled ahead of Governor Romney in another battleground state - Virginia. That's according to recent polls. This past week, we drove west from Washington, D.C. to the Shenandoah Valley of Virginia to talk to voters about the presidential election. On the way, we stopped at an apple barn to see some of the other choices Virginians face. JOE LIZER: Crispin or Golden Delicious, which are both a large, yellow apple and on the sweet side, and either Empire, which is like a Macintosh, or Ida Red, which is like a Jonathan, would be an excellent combination for a pie. WERTHEIMER: That's Joe Lizer, who owns the Virginia Farm Market in Winchester, Virginia, and bakes the pies he sells. Winchester is the county seat of Frederick County - George Washington really did live in the County - and Mitt Romney is very likely to get strong support there. Senator John McCain got 60 percent of the vote when he ran for president in 2008. Rutledge Patterson is a local businessman, a conservative republican, who really likes Romney. RUTLEDGE PATTERSON: I like about Romney 'cause he has a business background. I like the fact that he wants to lower taxes. I like the fact that he wants to maybe make the government smaller and try to reduce the deficit. WERTHEIMER: What about this most recent thing where he talks about the 47 percent. PATTERSON: If the caboose gets too big, the engine fails. You know, if there's too many people on the dole, where's the money coming from? WERTHEIMER: We met Mr. Patterson at the Daily Grind on Loudon Street in Winchester's old town. That's a pedestrian street lined with shops and restaurants. Some of the buildings go back to colonial times. We talked to two other businessmen outside that coffee shop. Eric Cales is an IT specialist who's voting for President Obama, but he is not enthusiastic. ERIC CALES: I would prefer to stay with the devil I know as opposed to the devil I don't. I don't either one of them are a good option for our country, and I just feel that it's better to go with what you know as opposed to the devil that's lurking in the dark. WERTHEIMER: Why not Romney? CALES: Why not Romney? I just believe he's too arrogant. I mean, he's talking about where the middle class falls, he doesn't even know what middle class is. WERTHEIMER: Eric Cales works for John Black. Black has a background in defense and intelligence. He voted for Mr. Obama last time because they're both from Hawaii. But he says he has serious national security concerns and this time he's voting for Mr. Romney. JOHN BLACK: Romney's an interesting character because if you study his actions back to when he was governor and when he does things, I like that man a lot more than I like what I see of the candidate. And I'm hoping that deep down inside that's the man. He's just a lousy speaker, a lousy politician, a lousy campaigner. He's the worst campaigner I've ever seen in all my years and I've been around the block a few times. I'm not a big fan, but I've been totally disillusioned by Mr. Obama. (SOUNDBITE OF CHILDREN PLAYING) WERTHEIMER: Young moms were waiting for their preschoolers outside the Weekday School at the First Presbyterian Church on Loudon Street. Pam Ramey told us she's voting for Romney and she likes his choice of Paul Ryan for vice president. PAM RAMEY: He's very cute. WERTHEIMER: He certainly is. RAMEY: He's young, and I think that's good. Young ideas. WERTHEIMER: Pam Ramey describes herself as a homemaker and rock solid Republican - not especially disturbed by Mr. Romney's remarks at a private fundraiser in which he said that 47 percent of Americans don't pay income taxes and see themselves as victims entitled to government support. My job, he said, is not to worry about those people. RAMEY: He needs to be concerned about all the people, but, you know, I get where he was going with that. I just think maybe it wasn't the right phrase that he used. WERTHEIMER: Does that affect any of your thoughts about what you might do? RAMEY: As far as changing my mind? WERTHEIMER: Um-hum. RAMEY: No. I just think it wasn't a polished thought. WERTHEIMER: Polls show President Obama does have strong support from women voters in Virginia. One reason may be this year's attempt by Republican state legislators to require an invasive vaginal ultrasound for anyone wanting an abortion. Maggie Major, another stay-at-home mom, says she's voting for President Obama purely on women's issues. But for that, she'd absolutely consider Republicans. MAGGIE MAJOR: I feel like nobody should have any input whatsoever in what I can do with my body. Period, end of story, reproduction or not. It's none of their business. The bottom line is: it's none of their business. WERTHEIMER: So, would you say that Virginia's politicians radicalized you on this? MAJOR: I wouldn't call it radicalize me. I think that I have a very common sense approach to it. I think that the Republicans could really grasp a huge number of women voters. Because I think that we're all - once you start having children, you become a little bit more conservative maybe. It's unfortunate. I grew up Republican. I voted for Bush, which is crazy. But when you start thinking about what they can actually tell you what to do with your own body, it's scary. WERTHEIMER: We also met a doctor. He's pro-life, an independent who's solid for Governor Romney, but not in love with his candidate, at least not yet. This is Dr. John Mikus. DR. JOHN MIKUS: You know, I don't think there's ever going to be that ideal right one. But in studying more of the philosophies and listening to more of the speeches and stances of Mitt Romney, I find myself more leaning towards his thinking and I feel more comfortable with him now. And I'm really looking forward to the one-on-one debates to let me and the rest of the country figure it out. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) WERTHEIMER: Winchester is a relatively prosperous town. A street musician plays for tourists and locals, including lots of movers-in who don't necessarily share the area's political traditions. We met one of them having lunch at the Village Market and Bistro on Loudon Street. John Paul Marcantonio works at Rubbermaid. He voted for Mr. Obama in 2008, but this time he's undecided. JOHN PAUL MARCANTONIO: Personally, I think we've started to swing over the line with from what I'm comfortable with in terms of entitlement culture in the country. And so what I have a personal battle with right now is, you know, I'm socially very, very liberal, becoming more and more fiscally conservative as I get older. WERTHEIMER: So, are you considering Mr. Romney? MARCANTONIO: I am. WERTHEIMER: And what is it you like about him? MARCANTONIO: Not necessarily about him - about policy. I mean, I want to understand a little better some of his policies and platforms. I think he's been a little bit light on describing exactly what he would do if he's in office. Hopefully, we'll see that through some of the debates and some of the other platforms he puts out. WERTHEIMER: Voters in a Virginia county which produces lots of Republican votes, and lots of wonderful apples. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) WERTHEIMER: You're listening to NPR News.

The race is one of a handful of contests that could determine party control of the Senate.\n                \n                    \n                    Charles Krupa/AP\n                    \n                \nhide caption Sen. Scott Brown, R-Mass., shakes hands with Democratic challenger Elizabeth Warren at their Oct. 1 debate in Lowell, Mass. The race is one of a handful of contests that could determine party control of the Senate. For Republicans itching to regain control of the Senate, Tuesday's election presents a rare opportunity. Only 10 GOP incumbents are on the ballot, compared with nearly two dozen Democrats and independents who caucus with them. That means the magic number for Republicans is low. They need only a net gain of three or four seats to take over the Senate \u2014 and, assuming they keep the U.S. House of Representatives, consolidate their influence on Capitol Hill. Democrats need to pick up 25 seats to seize the House, a goal that political analysts consider all but out of reach. So whether the votes break the Republicans' way in about a dozen close Senate races could have a profound effect on whether the \"do nothing\" Congress shakes its bad reputation and whether constituents should expect action on such big-ticket items as taxes, entitlement reform and energy policy. Vying for Leadership Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.), who famously vowed to make Barack Obama a one-term president, has promised that if his party wins the Senate in Election 2012, \"things will be different.\" McConnell delivered a floor speech in late September decrying the Senate's Democratic leadership for failing to complete the most \"basic work of government,\" from spending bills to budgets. \"So if the American people decide they want to make a change, the commitment I make to them is the Republican conference is going to pass a budget,\" he said. \"It may be hard. We may have to twist a few arms.\" But Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nev., isn't willing to give up his job just yet. \"The Republican Party has become the party of wouldn'ts and won'ts,\" Reid told the audience two months ago at the Democratic National Convention. \"I have had a front row seat to watch the Tea Party take over the Republican Party. For 3 1/2 years, they wouldn't govern. They couldn't lead. And we shouldn't let them take over the Senate and the White House.\" Senate Races To Watch Despite the favorable election arithmetic at the outset, Republicans are foundering in several key races and seem unlikely to take control. More likely, they'll pick up two or three seats, and lose a few. One such loss could come in Indiana. The reason: Tea Party favorite Richard Mourdock. The Indiana GOP nominee knocked out six-term Sen. Richard Lugar, a lion of the establishment and the most senior Republican in the chamber, after a heated primary challenge. \"If the Republicans lose that [Indiana] Senate seat, forget about taking back the Senate,\" says NPR political analyst Ken Rudin. \"It's going to make it that much more uphill a climb.\" Mourdock hurt himself with comments about rape and abortion, observing during a debate that if a rape victim becomes pregnant, that is God's will. Women's rights advocates called the comments demeaning, and his fellow Republicans called them a distraction. Mitt Romney's presidential campaign distanced itself from Mourdock's views. And his Senate opponent, three-term House member and moderate Blue Dog Democrat Joe Donnelly, pointed to the statement as evidence of Mourdock's extremism. Mourdock's remarks came on the heels of another controversy, this one in Missouri. Rep. Todd Akin, the GOP candidate, is in a tight race against incumbent Democratic Sen. Claire McCaskill. McCaskill had been considered one of the most vulnerable Democrats up for re-election this year, but Akin's comments about the unlikelihood of pregnancy after a \"legitimate rape\" drew national condemnation. Republican leaders and even members of the Tea Party Express pleaded with Akin to withdraw from the race, but he refused. Akin went on to compare his opponent to a \"dog,\" fetching high taxes and red tape and bringing them home to Missouri. Squeakers For early clues as to the mood of the electorate, political analysts say they'll be watching a few close races. Republican candidate George Allen, right, argues with Democratic candidate Tim Kaine during a Senatorial debate for the Virginia U.S. Senate seat on Thursday, Sept. 20 in McLean, Va.\n                \n                    \n                    Evan Vucci/AP\n                    \n                \nhide caption Republican candidate George Allen, right, argues with Democratic candidate Tim Kaine during a Senatorial debate for the Virginia U.S. Senate seat on Thursday, Sept. 20 in McLean, Va. Virginia: Two popular former governors are vying for a seat vacated by Democrat Jim Webb. Republican George Allen, a former U.S. senator and son of a professional football coach, is all but deadlocked against opponent Tim Kaine. Kaine led the Democratic National Committee \u2014 and many early polls. But the race has tightened in the final weeks before the election. Massachusetts: The contest for the seat once occupied by Democratic stalwart Ted Kennedy is up for grabs. Republican incumbent Scott Brown is running to protect his surprise 2010 victory. Brown is racing toward the center, even featuring President Obama in campaign ads. His competition, Harvard law professor Elizabeth Warren, in her first political race, is emphasizing her life's work in consumer protection \u2014 and collecting millions in out-of-state campaign donations. Montana: Incumbent Democrat Jon Tester faces six-term House member Denny Rehberg, who is emphasizing his deep roots in the state, his experience as a small-business owner and his fiscal conservatism. Rehberg has a slight lead in the polls, but most analysts consider this race a tossup. North Dakota: Republican Rep. Rick Berg has been holding on to a small lead against Democrat Heidi Heitkamp, a former state attorney general, who is trying to display her independence from Obama, who's unpopular in the state. Retiring Sen. Kent Conrad, a Democrat, decided not to run for a fifth term. Nebraska: Former Democratic Gov. and Sen. Bob Kerrey is straining to prove he can go home again \u2014 after presiding over the New School in New York City for nearly a decade. Kerrey has been behind in the polls against Republican Deb Fischer, a state legislator since 2004. In the run-up to the election to replace retiring Democrat Ben Nelson, Kerrey has attracted national attention, at least, with endorsements from comedian Steve Martin and former GOP Sen. Chuck Hagel. Other Races of Interest Aficionados are also keeping their eyes on three other Senate contests of note. In Nevada, incumbent Republican Dean Heller and Democrat Shelley Berkley are locked in a tight race, awash with millions of dollars spent on negative TV ads. The candidates could hardly be more different. Heller is a Mormon and a social conservative from a rural part of the state. He was elevated to the Senate after his predecessor, Republican John Ensign, departed following a sex scandal. Berkley, a U.S. House member representing the populous Las Vegas area, put herself through school by working as a cocktail waitress and a keno casino game runner. She has strong union support. So does Tammy Baldwin, a longtime U.S. House member from Wisconsin who could become the first openly gay member of the Senate. Baldwin, a Democrat, is in a tossup with former Wisconsin GOP Gov. Tommy Thompson. They're vying to replace Democrat Herb Kohl, who is retiring. And then there is former U.S. Surgeon General Richard Carmona, who would be the first Latino elected to the Senate from Arizona. Carmona is running as a Democrat against Rep. Jeff Flake. Flake, a staunch opponent of earmarks and wasteful spending in his House tenure, is hoping to keep the seat Republican after the retirement of longtime Sen. Jon Kyl. The House In the U.S. House, Democrats have virtually no chance of picking up the 25 seats they need to take the reins \u2014 even though Congress is unpopular and unproductive. The wave election in 2010 that ushered in dozens of Tea Party Republicans is unlikely to recede. Many experts think the Democrats will net 10 seats, at best. \"The success of Republicans in redrawing the district lines of some vulnerable members, especially freshmen, has made it a very heavy lift for Democrats to get into the majority,\" says Thomas Mann, a longtime political scholar at the Brookings Institution in Washington. So Mann is looking at a more narrow issue on Election Day, \"the fate of some of the most prominent Tea Party enthusiasts.\" Many of those lawmakers have become household names. For instance, there's onetime GOP presidential contender Michele Bachmann of Minnesota. Bachmann is scrapping to hold on to her seat and grab a fourth term against challenger Jim Graves, a Democratic businessman in his first political campaign. There's also Allen West, a Tea Party favorite in Florida, who is running in a new district this year after state GOP mapmakers initially put him in a more Democratic district. West, a retired Army officer and one of two black Republicans in the House, hit the headlines earlier this year after claiming at a town hall meeting that more than 78 House Democrats are \"communist.\" Challenging West is Patrick Murphy, a Democrat and first-time candidate who worked for his family's construction company doing restoration work after the BP oil spill. In Illinois, GOP incumbent Rep. Joe Walsh is down in the polls against Democrat Tammy Duckworth. Earlier this year, Walsh complained that Duckworth, an Iraq War veteran who lost both her legs in a helicopter crash, was talking too much about her military heroics. Duckworth responded by releasing a list of Walsh's bombastic remarks, which she called his \"greatest hits.\" Moments For History Congress is saying goodbye to several prominent members who are retiring, including Democrat Barney Frank of Massachusetts, the first openly gay member of Congress; also Democrat Dennis Kucinich of Ohio and Republican Ron Paul of Texas, who have both run for president. NPR's Rudin notes that the House races present any number of opportunities for \"firsts.\" In New Hampshire, Democrats Carol Shea-Porter and Ann McLane Kuster are running to unseat the GOP male incumbents. If both women win, the state's entire congressional delegation, including its two senators, would be composed of women. And in Massachusetts, there could be another moment ripe with history. Democrat Joe Kennedy III is running to fill the House seat long occupied by the retiring Frank. If Kennedy defeats businessman and Marine Corps reservist Sean Bielat, it would mark the return to Congress of the storied Kennedy family after the death of Sen. Edward Kennedy in 2009 and the departure of his son, Patrick, from the House in 2010. Finally, in Utah, an African-American and Mormon woman named Mia Love has pulled ahead of incumbent Democratic Rep. Jim Matheson in the weeks before the election. Love, the mayor of Saratoga Springs, has been groomed for big things by GOP leaders and got a prominent slot at the national convention this year. On The Radar Three House incumbents up for re-election are on the radar of federal law enforcement. Republican David Rivera of Florida, Republican Michael Grimm of New York and Democrat Jesse Jackson Jr. of Illinois are all staring down FBI investigations of their spending or donor relationships.",

Here, a protester shouts as he holds an American flag after storming the Wisconsin state Capitol in Madison last March, after Republicans in the state Senate voted to curb collective bargaining rights for public workers. Through the smog and the smeariness of the seemingly ceaseless process of selecting a president, one thing is clear: Americans are seething. Some Americans are livid over illegal immigration. Others are ticked off about Obamacare. President Obama himself is not too happy about the way things are. \"If one emotion came through in President Obama's State of the Union address,\" Forbes magazine notes, \"it was anger.\" Newt Gingrich growls every chance he gets:  \"I am angry, and every American should be angry\" about what he calls Mitt Romney's dishonesty. Recently rising Rick Santorum tells Fox News that Romney's health plan is \"something to get mad about.\" Tempers flared during Florida's primary in January, and former Gov. Charlie Crist told MSNBC that he was struck by the tone of the Republican Party. \"This past week or 10 days in Florida,\" Crist said, \"it has been a very angry tone, and regrettably, amazingly negative. My hope is, as a Floridian, as an American, we can get away from that negative tone.\" Good luck. We are in an angry, angry time. On the right, the Tea Party stages protests. On the left, the Occupy movement occupies. The Arizona governor wags an angry finger in the president's face. Candidates snarl at one another. Voters yell at candidates. Everybody is angry about something, even if it's just about the anger of everybody else. Unleashing The Limbic System We've gone through angry times before in this country: Vietnam, Redbaiting, the Depression, Reconstruction and the Civil War. The Revolution itself was sparked by a bunch of choleric colonists. So it's in our collective DNA. But historically, eventually, we always seem to sort of get over it. So how did we do that? Are there lessons to be learned in the anger-recovery periods of history? Why assume that anger is always something to 'get over?' Jane Dailey, University of Chicago An individual who needs to get over being outraged in order to live a more productive and harm-free life can sometimes get help. Anger managers have  strategies for escorting people through periods of pique. The emotion of anger, explains Rich Pfeiffer, president of the National Anger Management Association, \"activates the 'primitive' human brain \u2014 sometimes called the limbic system \u2014 which is automatic and impulsive, and if you are functioning out of the primitive part of your brain, you tend to want to punish, hurt, get back at, teach a lesson, or do something destructive to the person triggering your anger.\" Anger managers tell us that we should slow down our reaction to anger \"in order to have time to respond out of our more evolved brain \u2014 sometimes called the neocortex \u2014 which has the capacity to be reasonable, rational and logical,\" Pfeiffer says. Courses in managing fury suggest taking deep breaths, going for a walk \u2014 anything to separate yourself from the source of your anger. A Two-Step Recovery Program A nation, on the other hand, doesn't always have time to count to 10 or the ability to get away from itself. It doesn't always recover quickly or easily from periods of anger. And some historians are not so sure that it should. \"Why  assume that  anger is always something to 'get over?' \" asks Jane Dailey,  who teaches  American history at the University  of Chicago. \"Is it  always negative  or unproductive?  Obviously we don't want to devolve  into assaults on  the floor of the Senate \u2014 although I can think of one  or two people who  might benefit from caning \u2014 but there are times when  rage is  productive.\" Ushering the country through angry, divisive periods, says Mary Niall Mitchell, an American history professor at the University of New Orleans, has traditionally required a couple of things \u2014 a sort of two-step recovery program. The first step, Mitchell says, is some crisis or occurrence \"that took the collective attention away from the source of anger.\" The second step is \"a great deal of forgetting,\" she says. \"That forgetting \u2014 which is not to say forgiving \u2014 depended, in part, on the telling of new stories about the recent past.\" The creation of a new historical memory, one that was at odds with the historical record, Mitchell says, \"generally came at a great cost.\" She uses the Civil War and Reconstruction to illustrate. The crises that distracted the angry nation in the wake of the war, she says, were a financial panic and wars against Native Americans in the West.  The forgetting was the explanation by certain historians of the war's aftermath \"as one of reunion between the North and South achieved by rewriting the history of the Civil War,\" Mitchell explains. \"It was no longer a war to end slavery \u2014 in this interpretation \u2014 but rather a war over 'states' rights,' indeed, a war between brothers; and it was time, many argued in the 1890s and later, for the brothers to bury the hatchet.\" The Confederacy took on a romantic glow \u2014 with the myth of the \"Lost Cause\" \u2014 Mitchell says, and the South was portrayed in movies such as Birth of a Nation and Gone with the Wind \"as a 'lost civilization' where all slaves were happy and all hell broke loose with emancipation.\" Mitchell says that, as historian David Blight has pointed out, Frederick Douglass foresaw the revisionism coming and the worsening plight of African-Americans as the nation set about getting past its anger. \"Douglass, of course, was angry having fought so hard for African-American freedom and citizenship,\" Mitchell says. And \"you could argue that the leaders of the civil rights movement carried forward Douglass' anger and frustration, and were able to restore the rights that Reconstruction's aftermath had eliminated.\" So, says Mitchell, \"with my historian's hat on, I'm  leery of the notion of getting over the anger.  The lesson, I suppose,  is to always remember exactly why we were angry in the first place.\" There are, then, ways for a nation to soldier through angry eras. We have seen in recent times how a crisis \u2014 say Sept. 11 or the Tucson shootings \u2014 can refocus our attention and repurpose our emotions. But in this day and age, forgetting may not be as simple \u2014 or as acceptable \u2014 as it once was. With our deep databases, powerful search engines and countless websites, blogs and bulletin boards and interminably talkative media, it is arguably easier to remember \u2014 and easier to remind others \u2014 about the inaction or injustice that originally made us mad. Really, really mad.",

Advocates of stricter gun control legislation are hoping that history will not repeat itself. Last Friday's shootings at an elementary school in Newtown, Conn., have shaken the country, but it's unclear whether the intense feelings of the moment will translate into legislative action. Many times in the past, outrage over gun violence has dissipated before Congress has chosen to act. The question in the new year will be whether public opinion, which currently favors more restrictions on guns, will remain engaged enough to overcome opposition from the National Rifle Association and the rest of the gun lobby. \"I am optimistic because the American people are speaking out more and more, demanding sensible gun policies and demanding that their leaders address gun violence,\" says Jon Lowy, an attorney with the Brady Center to Prevent Gun Violence. During a news conference Wednesday, President Obama called on Vice President Biden to lead an effort \"to come up with a set of concrete proposals no later than January,\" which the president pledged to promote \"without delay.\" Several Democrats with strong records on Second Amendment issues have expressed a new openness to gun control legislation in recent days. A few congressional Republicans have said they're open to further discussion, without getting into too many specifics, but most have stayed quiet about gun control. Several Republicans at the state level have proposed arming teachers or administrators to protect against similar incidents. \"Gun control is not going to be something that I would support,\" Virginia Republican Robert Goodlatte, the incoming chairman of the House Judiciary Committee, told Roll Call. That means the chance for major changes to gun laws, while certainly greater than it was a week ago, is still unlikely, says Robert Spitzer, author of The Politics of Gun Control. Popular Vs. Organized Opinion A CNN/ORC International poll released Wednesday concluded that a slim majority of Americans \"favor major restrictions on guns or making all guns illegal.\" An even higher percentage of the 620 adults surveyed this week favor a ban on certain assault weapons and high-capacity ammunition magazines. Such support, however, is not overwhelming. And the lesson of lobbying in Congress is that a small but energized and organized minority can overcome widespread support that is expressed only in opinion polls \u2014 not in concerted action. The National Rifle Association, the country's most prominent gun rights group, boasts 4 million members who are known to express their opinions frequently to members of Congress. The NRA is widely credited with helping to defeat members who voted for a ban on certain assault-style weapons back in 1994. Of the 32 incumbent House Democrats who lost their seats in elections that year, 29 had voted for the crime bill that included the gun ban \u2014 including House Judiciary Chairman Jack Brooks, D-Texas, who died Dec. 4 Those victories helped Republicans win control of the House for the first time in 40 years. \"A lot of people credit the ban on assault weapons as the reason we lost the House,\" says Rep. Eliot Engel, D-N.Y. \"When Democrats passed the assault-weapons ban, the Democrats got wiped out and the [Newt] Gingrich revolution got swept in.\" 'The Passions Of The Moment' But, as Engel notes, there's been no indication from Republicans who are staunch defenders of gun rights that their positions are shifting. Gun ownership \"is an important right, and it is in the Constitution,\" Missouri GOP Sen. Roy Blunt told The Kansas City Star on Monday. \"These laws are not going to change in the near future.\" Given the renewed interest in the issue, though, Democrats are hopeful that a debate about gun control will progress in earnest \u2014 particularly if Obama keeps up the heat. \"Presidents can't convert large numbers of people from one position to another, but presidents can keep an issue in the news,\" says Jack Pitney, a government professor at Claremont McKenna College. \"If he continues to emphasize this in his remarks, that could have an impact.\" But Pitney stresses that emotions triggered by a specific event, however horrific, can fade. Even during his briefing on gun control, Obama fielded several questions regarding the fiscal cliff \u2014 demonstrating the difficulty even the president faces in keeping the nation focused on a single topic for very long. \"The problem for proponents of gun control is the passions of the moment might fade over the holidays,\" Pitney says. \"By the time Congress gets down to serious business in the new year, there may not be the same passion and drive that there is today.\" No Guarantees Democratic senators have promised quick action in the new year on a renewed assault-weapons ban, broader background checks and limitations on clip sizes. If the Senate is able to act quickly and Obama makes use of his bully pulpit, that would certainly put pressure on the House to do something. But what, exactly? Already, some legislators are talking about launching into a broader debate beyond gun regulations that would also take into consideration matters such as mental health and cultural influences such as violent video games. \"It's such a diffusion of the issues that it will never get done,\" says Elliot Fineman, CEO of the National Gun Victims Action Council. \"It's always their strategy \u2014 delay, delay, delay, knowing the public's attention span will dissipate.\" Spitzer, who chairs the political science department at the State University of New York in Cortland, says emotions are running higher on this issue than at any time since the aftermath of the Columbine school shootings back in 1999. The current public outcry, he says, will make it far more difficult for the gun lobby to do its usual work of quietly bottling up legislation. \"The NRA functions best when people are not paying much attention to the gun issues and the NRA can operate,\" Spitzer says. \"We know in past circumstances, when the public is outraged about a mass shooting, that's when the NRA is stymied.\" For its part, the NRA has kept mostly quiet, to the extent of taking down the organization's Facebook page. The group released a statement Monday and plans to hold a news conference Friday. Just weeks after the Columbine shootings, the Senate passed a bill with tough requirements on background checks and safety locks. But the House rejected the Senate approach, taking up separate bills relating to gun shows and youth culture. Similarly distinct and ultimately unproductive approaches may be taken by the two chambers next year. \"The chief goal of the gun lobby ... would be to keep a bill off the floor of the House,\" Spitzer says. \"They might feel the necessity of holding hearings, but getting a bill on the floor is the most critical friction point.\" Intense public pressure coupled with a continuing push from the White House may move gun control legislation further than has been the case for years, but there's no guarantee that advocates of that approach will prevail in the end. \"Depending on the moral outrage of the public to get members of Congress to do anything legislatively is a long shot,\" says Fineman, of the gun victims group. \"If the past is any guide to the future, I'd bet against.\"",

The White House and Congress continue to work on a deal that avoids the fiscal cliff and cuts deficits in the long run. One of the biggest hurdles is President Obama's proposal to raise tax rates for the wealthy. Republicans think a better course would be to raise revenue by closing loopholes and limiting deductions for high-income people. The question is, could that method raise enough money. The argument over how to get additional revenue to close the budget gap was carried on in dueling post-election news conferences last week. \"There are a lot of special-interest loopholes in the tax code, both corporate and personal,\" said House Speaker John Boehner, R-Ohio. \"There are all kinds of deductions, some of which make sense, others don't.\" Boehner said limiting or ending those unproductive tax breaks could boost growth and raise revenue. But Obama expressed skepticism during his news conference Wednesday. He said the Republican approach wouldn't raise enough money. \"It's very difficult to see how you make up that trillion dollars \u2014 if we're serious about deficit reduction \u2014 just by closing loopholes and deductions,\" the president said. \"You know, the math tends not to work.\" And the total that needs to be made up isn't just $1 trillion. That's because the president's proposal already calls for reducing mortgage interest and charitable deductions for the wealthy. Those steps are worth another $600 billion. So the total pile of revenue the Republican plan would have to produce to match the president's proposal is about $1.6 trillion. That's a tall order. One approach that was suggested by Mitt Romney during the campaign, and endorsed by the Wall Street Journal's editorial page last week, is to cap tax deductions at a specific dollar level. The nonpartisan Tax Policy Center has analyzed the idea. Its co-director, Donald Marron, says capping deductions for all taxpayers at $17,000 could produce $1.7 trillion in revenue over 10 years. That would meet the president's dollar goal. But there's one problem, Marron says. \"That would get to the president's revenue target, but obviously it would violate his desire not to raise taxes on people below the top 2 percent,\" he says. Of course, Marron says, Republicans don't agree with the president that $1.6 trillion in added tax revenue over the next 10 years is the right goal. \"There's also been discussion of aiming for $1 trillion rather than $1.6 trillion, and obviously $1 trillion would be easier to get to by doing things purely through deductions and exclusions and other tax breaks,\" Marron says. If you push that cap on deductions higher, let's say, up to $25,000, you could meet that $1 trillion revenue target. But you still don't eliminate the political problem, because around a quarter of the added tax burden would still fall on the middle-class taxpayers the president has pledged to protect. Marron does believe that eliminating many of the deductions and loopholes in the tax code is a good idea and could make the economy more efficient. But he says it needs to be done thoughtfully and deliberately. \"You know, if we had a rational, careful process, we would go through all of them one by one and decide whether to keep them, to fix them or to get rid of them,\" Marron says. He says dealing with the mortgage deduction provides a good example of the care that needs to be taken. \"There are many good arguments for why the mortgage interest deduction is bad policy and ought to be changed or eliminated. But you wouldn't want to do that tomorrow. That would be unfair to the people who've just bought a home on the expectation that they would have it. The housing market is weak.\" And ending the deduction could send the housing market back into the tank. Marron says it's the same with many of the other deductions that don't make sense. If they're going to be eliminated, Congress needs to figure out a way to phase them out slowly to give people time to adjust.",

The movement is protesting against Enrique Pena Nieto, candidate of the Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI). Read Another Article On Mexico's Election, The Drug War And The Economy Robert Looney is an economist and professor of national security affairs at the Naval Postgraduate School in California. Mexico's tepid economic performance in the last decade has been a major disappointment \u2014 and is one reason why the PRI, the less-than-democratic political party that was ousted in 2000 after 71 years of rule, has just returned to power in the country's presidential election. The economy, whose prospects seemed so bright in the wake of the creation of the North American Free Trade Agreement and the reforms of the 1990s, has been drifting. And it has lost ground to the other big Latin American economy, Brazil. Between 1982 and 2010, Brazil's per capita income increased from 65 percent of that of Mexico to 80 percent. Yet, just when everyone seemed ready to throw in the towel, the economy is showing signs of fulfilling its potential. Mexico grew by 4.0 percent in 2011, and the IMF is forecasting gains of 3.6 percent for 2012 \u2014 hardly stellar for an emerging-market economy, but better than Brazil, with corresponding rates of 2.7 percent and 3.0 percent. What's more, Mexico has managed to grow in spite of the surge of drug-related violence in key industrial zones. While this reversal of fortune vis-\u00e0-vis Brazil may simply reflect different positions in the business cycle (the two economies are rarely in phase), it does raise some intriguing questions. Is Mexico better situated to thrive in an uncertain global economic environment marked by the eurozone crisis and the slowdown of several major emerging economies, notably China? If so, what must President-elect Enrique Pena Nieto do to maintain the momentum? It's tempting to attribute Brazil's economic successes and Mexico's lackluster performance to their respective approaches to economic policy. Mexico has worked doggedly to implement the neo-liberal Washington Consensus approach to macroeconomic management \u2014 budget discipline, central bank independence, anti-inflationary monetary policy, and pro-market liberalization, including the development of a truly private banking system. In contrast, Brazil has mixed market neo-liberalism with an eclectic, proactive approach to economic policy; its \"heterodox\" features include a large, partially state-owned banking system with complex, discriminatory rules for credit allocation, and reliance on a witch's brew of state-led investment strategies aimed at eliminating infrastructure bottlenecks. Mexico's adoption of the Washington Consensus policies, it should be remembered, was not entirely voluntary. Once the country tied its fortunes to NAFTA, a neo-liberal agenda emphasizing price and exchange rate stability was needed to take full advantage of opportunities in the relatively open U.S. market. And joining NAFTA did pay off in terms of a tsunami of exports, nearly 80 percent of which end up in the U.S. By contrast, Brazil is still a fairly closed economy that has been diversifying its dependence on trade with the developed economies by deal-making in emerging markets. The timing (at least until this year) has been impeccable, allowing Brazil to surf the wave of commodity demand from Asia. Brazil has also fed the expectations of a rapidly growing middle class with plentiful consumer credit. The result has been visible gains in living standards (especially at the bottom end), but at the cost of greater volatility in prices, interest rates, and currency exchange rates. This has complicated economic management, and may (along with the country's low rates of savings and the decline in commodity export prices) leave policymakers with little room to dodge the next downturn. While it is fashionable in some quarters to attribute Brazil's higher growth rates to the country's pragmatic approach to economic management and Mexico's adherence to the neo-liberal gospel, I believe Mexico's economic performance is largely a product of the demand for Mexican products by the U.S. The numbers certainly support this view: The IMF found a high correlation between Mexican exports and GDP, with changes in exports statistically accounting for 86 percent of the variations in the country's growth rate between 1996 and 2010. Aaron Tornell (UCLA) and Gerardo Esquivel (El Colegio de Mexico) argued back in 1995 that Mexico's potential gains from the free trade agreement didn't end with lower tariffs in Mexico's biggest foreign market. They hoped that NAFTA would unleash domestic forces able to push a whole host of growth-facilitating reforms to completion. Successful exporters, they suggested, would have a big stake in making the rest of the economy more competitive because it would lower their costs. Hence they would be in the vanguard on issues ranging from education, to transportation, to anti-monopoly regulation. But most of those reforms were blocked by entrenched interests, many of them remnants of the corporatist economic system created in the 1930s by the PRI. The result has been a two-speed economy, based on a dynamic export sector that must shoulder the burden of an unproductive domestic economy. The newly elected Pena Nieto has promised reforms that could restore the vibrant growth of the 1950s and 1960s. These include a range of economists' greatest hits \u2014 everything from broadening the tax base,to permitting competition for Pemex, the notoriously inefficient, union-dominated national oil company. However, in light of the realities that (a) the PRI does not have an absolute majority in Congress, and (b) the PRI's old guard is hardly keen for reform, this will be a daunting task. Happily, major initiatives may not be necessary to sustain the growth momentum a while longer. The country's economic regulators, who have considerable independence, have been playing a much more active role in fighting monopoly power, even taking on telecom oligarch Carlos Slim, the world's richest man (though with limited success). By no coincidence, last year Mexico jumped eight places on the World Economic Forum's Competitiveness Index, to 58th in the world. But regulatory initiatives alone can only go so far. Luckily, other forces that don't require the approval of the legislature are also pushing the economy in the right direction. First, Mexico is gaining an edge in the U.S. market thanks in large part to the declining competitiveness of China, where wages are rising faster than productivity and the currency has been appreciating against the dollar. Second, U.S. manufacturing has become leaner and more flexible, making it more competitive in global markets. And these manufacturers are likely to carry Mexican firms, which are deeply integrated as suppliers of manufactured components, along for the ride. Third, Mexico's preferential access to the U.S. market serves as a magnet for direct investment by multinationals that are increasingly focused on shortening their supply chains \u2014 a process known in biz-school-speak as \"near-shoring.\" Mexico's neo-liberal agenda, overreliance on the U.S. market, inability to match China's costs in third markets, and crony capitalist environment have been seen as liabilities that condemned the economy to sub-par growth. The crony capitalism isn't going away anytime soon. But other \"burdens\" are looking more and more like assets. Meanwhile, President Pena Nieto will be trying to chip away at the barnacles slowing the economy. And while it's hard to believe that he will get far in plans to reduce drug-related violence \u2014 proximity to the U.S. market is not always an advantage \u2014 the payoff in terms of investment and economic efficiency would be enormous. With a little luck (OK, a lot of luck and even more determination), he could restore the luster lost by the PRI through decades of corruption and thuggish rule.",

            "article_content": "NPR's First and Main series interviewed voters in Wisconsin, Colorado and Florida.\n                \n\n                    NPR.org\n                    \n\nhide caption NPR's First and Main series interviewed voters in Wisconsin, Colorado and Florida. NPR audience researchers asked listeners about the newsroom's election coverage and found general satisfaction, but two criticisms stood out. One, concerning false balance, is common about the news media today. The second, however, strikes at a core practice in American journalism. Responding to an open question that asked \"If you could change one thing,\" many listeners wrote that NPR should kill interviews with the man on the street. As one respondent put it, \"I really don't care what some random dude in Florida thinks.\" Audience analyst Ben Robins didn't quantify how many of the 5,500 respondents made this criticism in various ways, but he said that it was \"a running theme in our polls for the last couple of years.\" This seemed discomfiting to some NPR reporters and editors I spoke to, and surely would be for most American journalists. Unlike those in almost every other country, we pride ourselves in including ordinary people in as many stories as possible. This practice is taught in journalism schools and hammered by editors as a way to humanize the news and connect with the audience. But if the survey results are representative \u2014 you tell me \u2014 then something has changed in recent years and the audience isn't connecting back. Robins wasn't sure why, but he offered thoughts. The many survey answers, pulled together, he said, suggest that listeners and readers feel that interviews with voters, some of them uninformed, take time and space away from more valuable analysis and fact-checking. This is on a rational level. Any social psychologist will tell you that all of us also operate on an intuitive level that is more powerful and often irrational. As Jonathan Haidt of New York University shows in his book, The Righteous Mind: Why Good People Are Divided by Religion and Politics, we like to have our own opinions reinforced. This demand seems to have become more accentuated by the polarization of recent years. We want to hear from candidates and experts in news reports. And it might be OK to interview an ordinary voter like ourselves with whom we agree. But it raises our hackles to hear someone no more qualified than us say things with which we disagree. Who is that guy to be on the air? Supporting this observation is that many of the political bias complaints I receive commonly cite an interview with a man on the street as proof. \"I have a favor to ask, not just of NPR, but of all news organizations,\" wrote Jesse Austin in Wisconsin Rapids, Wis., of one report. \"Can you just interview the candidates and party leaders, fact-check to determine the accuracy of their statements and report back to your listeners/readers/viewers? Nothing is more frustrating for me than hearing/reading/seeing know-nothing voters such as the ones in this report expose their utter ignorance.\" This is going to get me in trouble with my fraternity of fellow journalists, but I partly agree. I think that, while there is a place for interviews with ordinary citizens, we journalists have turned the practice into a fetish that has gone overboard. The doting over the man-on-the-street interview grows out of a historical populist streak in the country and with it, in the profession. American newspapers were the first to appeal to the masses, with the introduction of the penny press in the 1830's. Ever since, the U.S. news media has remained less elite and more local than in most other parts of the world. Beginning stories with anecdotes, and telling stories as narratives, was introduced in the early 20th century and became most identified with the The New Yorker and, later, The Wall Street Journal, where I was once an editor. NPR later popularized journalistic storytelling in radio, creating its famous \"driveway moments,\" when serious stories are made so compelling on a human level that we find ourselves sitting in our cars listening to them after we have arrived at our destination. Contrast that with the greater dryness of the BBC. The inclusion of more color and interviews with ordinary citizens also spread into otherwise straight political stories. \"I think a general cultural populism plus the featurization trend in the past 40 years or so both are factors,\" Michael Schudson, an historian and sociologist at the Columbia University Graduate School of Journalism told me. In the post-Watergate, post-Vietnam era of cynicism, reporters, too, wanted to break free from quoting only officials and executives. I did it as a reporter. I am teaching this year at Columbia and demand that my students do it. NPR editors and reporters \u2014 like journalists from The Washington Post to Fox News \u2014 do it, too, including in their current campaign coverage. But foreign reporters have always been mystified by our practice. Gabriel Garcia Marquez, who began his career as a journalist, is head of a center in Cartagena, Colombia, that teaches in-depth narrative journalism to reporters from around Latin America. Neither he nor almost any other leading writer, editor or journalist outside the United States that I can think of pushes to include man on the street quotes in everyday news stories. When five years ago the Australian Rupert Murdoch bought The Wall Street Journal, one of the first things he did was kill the two long narrative \"leders\" that ran down each side of the front page. [See editor's note.] American journalism considered them to be exemplary icons. Murdoch and his new editors considered them to be a waste of space. They, like most foreign journalists, will publish the occasional light feature but argue that serious readers mostly want tight, serious analysis\u2014and lots of it. The NPR poll suggests that they are right. This is not to say that NPR listeners do not want their driveway moments. The magazine format on Morning Edition and All Things Considered has been extraordinarily successful. But as political news has grown considerably on NPR \u2014 a function of ceaseless political campaigning, to the chagrin of me and many listeners \u2014 the practice of shoehorning quotes from \"some random dude in Florida\" into an ordinary campaign story begins to be annoying because of what it often is: a limited and uninformed point of view. The news consumption habits fostered by the internet have further reduced our patience for stories that aren't either to the point or compelling. A continuing loss of public trust in journalism and other institutions, meanwhile, breeds ever-more cynicism about why someone \u2014 especially someone with whom we might disagree \u2014 is quoted. Inside NPR, Neal Carruth, the editor who oversees the current election coverage, is sensitive to the criticism. He acknowledged that asking a man on the street to analyze a campaign or a candidate adds little. But he defended the value of asking average Americans to speak to about what they know better than anyone else: their own lives and decisions. He pointed to NPR's \"First and Main\" series, which interviewed voters in Winnebago County, Wis., Larimer County, Colo., and Hillsborough County, Fla. \"The objective was not to turn voters into pundits,\" he said, \"but to get into their lives. To try to understand the way people's busy, daily lives intersect with the political process. They have to make big decisions about the future of the country while they try to put food on the table, work two jobs, or find a job.\" \"That's where the best reporting on voters succeeds,\" he said. Some listeners didn't agree. \"I am sick of hearing election coverage,\" wrote Joe Higgins of Burt, N.Y. \"While I know this must be done, you do not need to make it worse with spots like your 'First and Main' series. I am not particularly interested in Colorado students' opinions on the candidates. I am interested in analysis of candidates' positions, what is going on in Syria, Libya, and in spots like the one on nano particles.\" I agree with Carruth that there is a value in fully developing the thoughts of ordinary voters and placing them in the context of national trends. But pulling that off in a way that is actually interesting and adds value is extraordinarily difficult. Half of the respondents in the NPR survey said that stories \"depicting voters' thoughts\" are either \"not very important\" or \"not at all important.\" This question seems to be referring to stories like those in the First and Main series. Whether you think the series succeeded, then, seems to be a matter of taste. I am lukewarm. Meanwhile, it is those one-off quotes stuck into political stories that I find most disposable. In an earlier column, correspondent Ari Shapiro made a poetic defense of including them, saying: No one voice will ever be wholly representative of Americans' views on anything, which is to say that listeners should not hear a particular quote as representing a universal view. But my goal is to paint a complete picture over the course of the campaign using a pointillistic approach, where each voter's voice is a dot of color that, viewed together from a distance, reflects the 2012 electorate in its entirety. I admire his idealism, but I wonder if many listeners remember or hear the quotes in all the stories enough to be left with a mosaic. I suspect that the conceit is appreciated mostly by other journalists. It seems to me that Carruth's distinction of not having an uninformed voter analyze a candidate or issue \u2014 unless it is a demonstration of a poll or part of an analysis of public opinion \u2014 is a sensible starting point to discuss how to put the man-on-the-street genie back in the bottle. I am not sure where the discussion should end, except to say that the practice is way overdone and seems now to be counter-productive with many news consumers. As the historian Schudson told me: \"I don't see that we should (or can) run away from our populism and the virtue it has of seeking to keep journalism inclusive and democratic \u2014 but it may be that the random person-on-the-street quote should be retired or at least used sparingly as a format for populism and we should be thinking harder about how to do populism more imaginatively. You can't turn every story into a 10 or 15 minute segment of 'This American Life' but maybe there are some other ways to proceed.\" You may have ideas. Please share them. Editor's Note, Nov. 2, 2012: The Wall Street Journal still does narrative journalism, and usually runs one investigative, narrative or special article somewhere on page one called a \"leder,\" as front page editor Rebecca Blumenstein pointed out to me. But this is what many newspapers do and is not the identifiable institution of old, not that this is good or bad. The paper's editor-in-chief, Robert Thomson, is Australian, and its deputy editor Gerard Baker is English. Assistant to the ombudsman Lori Grisham contributed to this report.",

            "article_content": "Republican nominee Mitt Romney campaigned in Nevada on Wednesday.  MELISSA BLOCK, HOST: Now to the presidential race and here is one way you can tell we're nearing the end of an extremely close competition. Look at the miles the candidate will travel today, more than 3,000 each. Both President Obama and Governor Mitt Romney will be in Iowa, Nevada and Colorado. The president then takes an overnight flight to Florida and Gov. Romney will go to sleep in yet another battleground state, Ohio. We're going to hear from both campaigns. First, I'm joined by NPR's Ari Shapiro, who's in Reno with Mitt Romney. And first, Ari, any comment from Mitt Romney himself today about the statements from the Senate candidate Richard Mourdock in Indiana? ARI SHAPIRO, BYLINE: None at all, nor did any campaign aides come to the back of the plane for many press conferences they sometimes do. If they had, we certainly would have asked about it. As it was, Romney's message on the stump here in Reno was very specifically about families. He talked about how his election would make a difference to each member of a family. For seniors, he talked about Medicare. For college students, he talked about debt. This was his message for 40 and 50-years-olds who he said might have a new house or be saving for retirement. MITT ROMNEY: And so you're thinking about these as being the most productive years and yet you're finding that that's not the case, the value of your home is not going up. You're not able to put anything away. You're barely able to make ends meet. SHAPIRO: Romney also put a heavy emphasis on early voting, just as President Obama's been doing. One introductory speaker I thought made a pretty compelling case. He said, listen, if you go vote early, the campaigns will stop calling your house and harassing you, telling you to go vote. BLOCK: Ari, it's the second time in two days that Mitt Romney has been in Nevada. It's a state that Barack Obama won by a wide margin in 2008, but obviously Mitt Romney thinks he has a chance there if he's spending all this time there. SHAPIRO: That's right. Yesterday, he and his running mate Paul Ryan kicked off their final two week sprint with a rally outside Las Vegas. Today, of course, their back in Reno. The headline in the local paper, the Las Vegas Review Journal, was \"Romney and Ryan Blow Through Nevada, But Is It Too Late?\" Republicans believe that the economic mess here makes it a pretty good place for Romney's argument that the last four years have been a failure. Housing, unemployment, bankruptcies, all much higher in Nevada than many other places in the country. But Romney faces two big challenges here. One is the housing market. Democrats are hammering Romney's statement that the solution is to let the market hit bottom and also, Nevada has a large Latino population, which could make it difficult for Romney to win here. This week, in fact, President Obama told the Des Moines Register in Iowa that if Mitt Romney loses, it will be because he alienated Hispanic voters with his position on immigration. You know, Nevada has only six electoral votes, but the fact that it's being fought over so intensely shows what a close race this is, That even a state as small as Nevada could make the difference. BLOCK: And onward after Reno to where exactly, Ari? SHAPIRO: Well, the pace doesn't slow down, but the geographic scope will narrow a bit so we end late tonight in Cincinnati and then Romney shifts from plane travel to bus travel for a packed day of rallies all over Ohio on Thursday. Friday it's Iowa, then back to Ohio. Saturday and Sunday are focused on Virginia and Florida. This intense map-hopping schedule is a reminder that while Romney has brought this race incredibly close, there is no one swing state where he has a comfortable enough lead to count it safely in his column. And more or less, the same could be true of President Obama as well. BLOCK: Okay. NPR's Ari Shapiro on the road with Mitt Romney in Reno. Ari, thanks so much. SHAPIRO: You're welcome.

            "article_content": "Look at this map, and notice that deep, deep in the Republican South, there's a thin blue band stretching from the Carolinas through Georgia, Alabama and Mississippi. These are the counties that went for Obama in the last election. A blue crescent in a sea of red. These same counties went mostly blue in 2004 and 2000. Why? Well, the best answer, says marine biologist Craig McClain, may be an old one, going back before the Civil War, before 1776, before Columbus, back more than 100 million years to the days when the Deep South was under water. Those counties, as he writes here, went for Obama because trillions and trillions and trillions of teeny sun-loving creatures died there. He's talking about plankton. That's why the Republicans can't carry those counties. Blame plankton. [Don't leave. I know some of you bounced here because my headline was political, and the word \"plankton\" will send you scuttling back to HuffPo, Politico and Drudge, where politics is plankton-free. But before you go, check out this next map.] It's an image of North America as it looked during the Cretaceous era, 129 million to 65 million years ago. As you can see, much of the continent was still covered by water. The Deep South had a shoreline that curled through the Carolinas, Georgia, Alabama and Mississippi, and there, in the shallow waters just offshore, were immense populations of floating, single-celled creatures who drifted about, trapped sunshine, captured carbon, then died and sank to the sea bottom. Those creatures became long stretches of nutritious chalk. (I love chalk.) When sea levels dropped and North America took on its modern shape, those ancient beaches \u2014 so alkaline, porous and rich with organic material \u2014 became a \"black belt\" of rich soil, running right through the South. You can see the Cretaceous beaches in this map, colored green. McClain got these maps from geologist Steve Dutch's website, at the University of Wisconsin, Green Bay. And because this stretch was so rich and fertile, when cotton farmers moved here in the 19th century, this stretch produced the most cotton per acre. Harvests of 4,000-plus bales were common here. Notice that the most productive plantations mirror the ancient coastline. Then came slavery. McClain, quoting from Booker T. Washington's autobiography, Up From Slavery, points out: \"The part of the country possessing this thick, dark and naturally rich soil was, of course, the part of the South where the slaves were most profitable, and consequently they were taken there in the largest numbers.\" After the Civil War, a lot of former slaves stayed on this land, and while many migrated North, their families are still there. In this 2000 census, you can see that the counties with the biggest populations of African-Americans still trace that Cretaceous shoreline. This, says marine biologist McClain, explains that odd stretch of Obama blue; it's African-Americans sitting on old soil from ancient organisms that turned sunshine into fertilizer. So plankton remain a force in Southern elections \u2014 though not always, not continuously. After the Civil War, when the South voted solidly Democratic and Jim Crow laws ruled, many blacks couldn't vote, so the pattern disappears. Voting rights laws hadn't been passed during the Goldwater-Johnson election of 1964, so in this map, the African-American difference is invisible. But some African-Americans were still there. So was the soil (though it's not as rich as it once was), and so were the rocks that geologist Steve Dutch \"found immediately familiar\" because they mapped those ancient shores. All of which is to say, when you cover politics, sometimes, without realizing it, you are also telling rock tales. Geology, every so often, peeks through. Geologist Steve Dutch's detailed maps, and careful analysis, come from a study he did of the Bush-Gore election in 2000. He called it \"Geology and Election 2000.\" You can find that here. \"Dr. M\" (that's Craig McClain's Nom de Blog at \"Deep Sea News\") wrote his geology analysis here.",

But whoever wins the presidency this year will preside over a U.S. economy where automation is becoming increasingly important. As many folks know, Bill Clinton was called the First Black President by Toni Morrison in The New Yorker. Barack Obama has been dubbed the First Gay President by Andrew Sullivan in Newsweek and the First Female President by Dana Milbank in The Washington Post. But no matter which man wins the next election \u2014 Obama or presumed challenger Mitt Romney \u2014 he may well go down in history as the First Robot President. This is not because people have found each guy to be robot-like on occasion \u2014 though they have. As far back as 2009, Fox Nation posted a video featuring Obama's never-changing smile and asking, \"Is Obama a Robot?\" And Romney is often ribbed about his robotic behavior. For example, Greg Gutfeld of Fox News said that Romney's \"flaws are robotic malfunction that prevents him from seeing words beyond their basic utility, like Robby the Robot from Lost in Space, he sees no emotional import in his phrasing, so even when he's right, he sounds wrong.\" No. The next humanoid in the White House may be called the First Robot President because he will be reckoning with the increasing influx and influence of robots in our everyday lives. The Politics Of Robotics Perhaps you have noticed: Robots are everywhere. They are working on farms and serving us coffee. They are cleaning our rugs and grading students' exams. We are suddenly surrounded \u2014 by dancing droids, soccerbots, robot cars and drones that do all kinds of work for us and watch our every move. The politics of robotics, however, is a tricky thing. To support the development of robotics can be viewed as denigrating to the work of humans; robots take jobs from people. On the other hand, to rant against the research and development of robotics could be viewed by voters as shortsighted, unimaginative and Ludditical. There has never been much political currency in opposing technological change in the U.S., says David Autor, an economist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. And \"generally that's good. Politicians are happy to rail against foreign workers, but they almost never rail against innovation, at least here. Perhaps that's because a lot of the innovation happens in the U.S. So we get the benefits as well as the costs.\" But when the day comes that labor-saving robotics are introduced on a large scale \"there will be winners and losers,\" Autor says. \"There almost always are with technical advances.\" For example, the Luddites \u2014 groups of workers in 19th century England who destroyed machines because they threatened people's jobs \u2014 were justified in worrying about the impact on the labor force of textile industry innovations such as the \"flying shuttle\" and \"spinning jenny,\" Autor says. \"These technologies very likely reduced their earning power \u2014 even as they increased total societal wealth by making more 'stuff' with less work.\" Interest in the domestic use of unmanned drones is surging among public agencies, raising privacy concerns. Here, a Ritewing Zephyr II flies with mounted camera in Berkeley, Calif.\n                \n                    \n                    Eric Risberg/AP\n                    \n                \nhide caption Interest in the domestic use of unmanned drones is surging among public agencies, raising privacy concerns. Here, a Ritewing Zephyr II flies with mounted camera in Berkeley, Calif. If Apple or Wal-Mart suddenly introduced \"a $1,000 robot that could clean houses, cut grass, cook meals and chauffeur the kids to school,\" Autor says, \"this would be hugely welfare-improving for people who currently do these tasks themselves or pay others to do them. But it would be devastating to people who make a living doing these tasks.\" The problem, he explains, is not one of overall societal wealth but of income distribution. \"For most of us, our primary asset is ownership of our labor, which commands a wage in the marketplace that supports a decent standard of living,\" Autor explains. \"If the task that we are most productive at doing suddenly became cheap and abundant because it can be done by low-cost machinery, this would be hugely disruptive.\" Labor-saving devices continue to proliferate. In Japan, for instance, the Fanuc Corp. operates a factory in which robots build other robots. It's called \"lights out\" manufacturing because no lighting is needed in the factory. Still, Autor points out, the total robotification of labor is a long way off because many simple tasks performed by humans are actually quite complicated for machines. Innovation Nation So, how do the candidates feel about robots? During his first term, Obama has shown great ardor for the R2D2 population. He has rallied the Roomba types by launching the National Robotics Initiative that provides up to $70 million in research grants for robotics. \"Robots are working for us every day, in countless ways,\" according to the White House. \"At home, at work, and on the battlefield, robots are increasingly lifting the burdens of tasks that are dull, dirty or dangerous. ... But they could do even more.\" Students show President Obama inventions they entered in a robotics competition at Thomas Jefferson High School for Science and Technology in Alexandria, Va., last September.\n                \n                    \n                    Jim Watson/AFP/Getty Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption Students show President Obama inventions they entered in a robotics competition at Thomas Jefferson High School for Science and Technology in Alexandria, Va., last September. The post continues: \"Robotics can address a broad range of national needs such as advanced manufacturing, logistics, services, transportation, homeland security, defense, medicine, health care, space exploration, environmental monitoring and agriculture.\" Through such high-tech programs, Obama was quick to point out during the official announcement, the National Robotics Initiative will \"make our businesses more competitive and create new, high-quality manufacturing jobs.\" Romney, too, is an outspoken advocate of ingenuity. Though the former Massachusetts governor may not have issued any official statements on the place of robotics in society, he has waxed poetic on the futurific premise \u2014 and promise \u2014 of labor-saving innovation. Speaking to an audience of more than 900 technology folks in Northern Virginia in February, Romney regaled the group with a historic tale of American innovation. He spoke of reading At Home by Bill Bryson last summer. \"It's actually kind of a fun book,\" he said. Gesturing enthusiastically, Romney told the crowd about Bryson's description of a worldwide expo in London in 1850 when nations were invited to send samples of their accomplishments. \"From all over the world came art \u2014 art, music and so forth,\" Romney said. But America \"sent over several large crates ... and they put together what was a McCormick Reaper. This is what came from America, all right. This is what we were most proud of.\" The McCormick Reaper, Romney said, \"was able to do the work of 70 men in agriculture, 70 people could be replaced by one machine. By virtue of that innovation and others like it, agriculture did no longer require the entire population to feed the population. And so people could move to cities, begin the Industrial Age and change the world.\" Bryson actually writes that the machine could replace 40 men. But the point is the same: One machine doing the work of many people is a positive step. And, at another juncture, while speaking to a town hall-style meeting in February, Romney roused the crowd by praising the future-oriented spirit of the American people. \"Great entrepreneurs and innovators and thought-leaders,\" he said, \"have made this the greatest nation in the history of the Earth.\" He got a standing ovation. He was speaking in Shelby Township, Mich., at the Eagle Manufacturing Co. They make robots.",

            "article_content": "Ron Paul is not going to be the Republican nominee for president in 2012. You know it, I know it, everyone knows it. Even Ron Paul knows it. His acknowledgement that Mitt Romney will be the nominee is just stating the obvious. But what exactly did he mean when he said last week that he will \"no longer spend resources campaigning in primaries in states that have not voted\"? Was he telling us that he was dropping out of the race? Not quite. There was a time, early in this year's cycle, where the guess was that Paul was going to perform far better in 2012 than he did in 2008, when he also sought the GOP nomination. He was better known, his iconoclastic views were thought to be more popular, and his supporters had a better understanding of the system. But after all was said and done, he failed to win a single primary or caucus. Yes, he finished a strong second in New Hampshire, barely lost in Maine, and took 40 percent in Virginia (in a one-on-one with Romney). But first place? Didn't happen. And so, as Romney's competitors slowly dropped out, Paul was the last challenger left standing. But for what purpose? He wasn't going to win in Tampa. It wasn't about a prime-time speaking slot at the convention. It's probably not about influencing the party platform, though he will certainly try to get his views about monetary policy and foreign policy represented. And for all the talk about well, maybe he can win on the second ballot ... that is a fantasy that's just not going to happen. No Republican nomination has gone past a first ballot since 1948. He undoubtedly knows that as well. And it wasn't just to get enough delegates to disrupt the convention. Paul seems quite cognizant that any confrontations at or outside the convention hall would be counter-productive. (Paul supporters have reportedly been booing Romney backers at other party conventions, such as in Arizona and Oklahoma.) For most of the past year, nearly every journalist who interviewed Paul felt compelled to ask him if his ultimate goal was to run as the Libertarian Party nominee (as he did once before, in 1988). Paul kept saying he had no \"intention\" to do so, but few believed him. Everyone seemed to miss the obvious: It is all about the future of the Republican Party. Paul says his campaign will not spend any money in the 11 states that haven't yet voted, and he won't. For one thing, he doesn't have the money. But he will be \u2014 and has been \u2014 packing county and state conventions with his supporters and electing Paul-friendly activists as delegates ... even if they are committed to voting for Romney in Tampa. \"I hope all supporters of liberty will remain deeply involved,\" Paul wrote. \"Become delegates, win office and take leadership positions.\" In Nevada, for example, 22 of the 25 at-large delegates selected at the recent state convention were all Ron Paul backers \u2014 even though Romney easily won the state in the February caucuses. (Former Gov. Bob List, a Romney delegate who lost his Republican national committeeman post to a Paul supporter, talked about the situation during last week's Junkie segment on TOTN. See below for link.) On Saturday in Minnesota, Paul supporters took 12 of the 13 national delegate positions that were at stake; he now has 32 of the state's 40 delegates pledged to him. Paul supporters have performed similarly in Maine. In Alaska, a Paul backer was elected state GOP chair. Unless lightning strikes \u2014 and it won't \u2014 Romney will easily win the Republican nomination in Tampa on the first ballot. But many of those delegates in the hall will be Paul supporters, even if they are bound by party law to vote for Romney. The convention, however, is only four days long. And November is right around the corner. Pretty soon, we'll be talking about 2014. And the presidential campaign of 2016. That's what is happening with the party conventions right now. It's not about 2012. It's about the future. And these \"champions of liberty\" may find themselves with a far bigger role than they do today. James Abdnor dies. Former Sen. Jim Abdnor, a South Dakota Republican who ended George McGovern's Senate tenure in 1980, only to lose his seat six years later to Tom Daschle, died May 16 at the age of 89. A longtime elected official \u2014 first as a member of the Legislature and later as lt. gov. \u2014 Abdnor won an open House seat in 1972, the same year McGovern challenged Richard Nixon for the presidency. Eight years later he took on McGovern himself, who was seeking a fourth Senate term. Riding a huge anti-liberal tide, with Ronald Reagan recapturing the White House for the GOP, Abdnor won by a 58-39 percent margin. A low-key lawmaker not known for his great oratory, he was challenged for renomination in 1986 by Gov. Bill Janklow, who called Abdnor too weak to hold the seat in November. Abdnor won the primary but narrowly lost to Rep. Thomas Daschle in the general election. Political Updates. I post periodic political updates during the week on Twitter. You can follow me at @kenrudin. Time for some questions from readers. The first two are in response to comments I made during the TOTN Junkie segment last Wednesday: Q: Your position on recalls, specifically of Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker, kinda surprised me. The discussion \u2014 prompted by callers \u2014 seemed to turn on \"did Walker change positions from his campaign?\" (Also, did Walker even mention reversing decades-old bargaining rights in his campaign?). Your cavalier \"so what? every candidate does it\" response is neither helpful nor insightful. And your example of Obama's \"close Guantanamo\" position-reversal is instructive. While Gitmo certainly affects the lives and rights of detainees, Obama's reversal affects the lives and rights of very few Americans. Scott Walker's \"reversal\" (or unmentioned position) is a statewide issue with a very large constituency. His reversed (or brand-new \u2014 I would argue \"hidden until after the election\" agenda) impacts the working lives of many, even perhaps most Wisconsinites. Recall is an instrument \u2014 albeit blunt \u2014 at their disposal, and they should use it. \u2014 Bill Wilson, Los Angeles, Calif. Similarly ... Q: I understand being squeamish about recalls \u2014 I'm a California Democrat, after all! But consider this: Walker's failure to describe his policy on collective bargaining was a major deception on his part. It was not a conscientious change of heart come to after wrestling with unexpected issues in office, but rather an immediate line of attack, taken within weeks of his swearing in. One protection against frivolous recalls is having a very high bar for how many signatures are required to initiate one. Wisconsin certainly met this test. \u2014 Phyllis Meshulam, Sebastopol, Calif. A: Both of you make valid points. My point was not that Wisconsin voters don't have the right to recall their elected officials, and I certainly wasn't judging their recourse or defending Walker's actions. But for Walker opponents to say the reason they are going ahead with the recall because the governor never talked about taking away the collective bargaining rights of public employees during the campaign just seemed specious to me. Attempt to recall anyone you want, if the laws of that state allow it. There are many people in the Badger State absolutely furious with Walker's policies. But, at least in my way of looking at it, using \"well, he never said he would do that during the campaign\" as a justification just feels disingenuous. For the most part, Democrats love, and Republicans detest, the gov. recall in Wisconsin.  Which is the opposite of how they saw the 2003 California recall.\n                \n                    \n                    Ken Rudin collection\n                    \n                \nhide caption And you know that if Walker is recalled on June 5, his supporters will attempt to recall Tom Barrett (D) at the next opportunity. That was the tit-for-tat mentality I fear the most, something we've watched on Capitol Hill for decades. (You voted to bring down Robert Bork? OK, we'll bring down Jim Wright. Or, you blocked Clinton's judges? OK, we'll block Bush's judges. You filibustered Bush's appointees? We'll filibuster Obama's appointees. Ad nauseum.) Still, having said all that, in listening back to the program, it sounded as if I were dismissing the arguments for the Walker recall outright. That wasn't what I meant to do and I apologize if it came off that way. Q: It is entirely possible that Mitt Romney might not win his state of Massachusetts in the general election. I believe Al Gore failed to win Tennessee when he ran in 2000. Who was the most recent presidential candidate from a major party who failed to win his own state in a general election? \u2014 Matt Potter, Ardmore, Pa. A: For the purposes of your question, we'll count Massachusetts as Romney's home state, even though he was born in Michigan. (I'm using the same criteria for making Texas the home states of George Bush Sr. and Jr., even though they were born in Massachusetts and Connecticut, respectively.) Thus, Gore would be the most recent example of a candidate who failed to win his home state. And, for the record, had he done so, he would have won the presidency. Other examples in the past half-century: George McGovern (lost South Dakota in 1972), Richard Nixon (a resident of New York when he ran in 1968), and Adlai Stevenson (lost Illinois in both 1952 and '56). Q: If Willard Mitt Romney is elected President, would he be the second President, along with Stephen Grover Cleveland, that would be primarily known by his middle name? Or have their been others? \u2014 James McKinstra, Aurora, Minn. A: Here are three more since Cleveland: David Dwight Eisenhower, John Calvin Coolidge and Thomas Woodrow Wilson. And Gerald Ford, who was adopted, was born Leslie King Jr. Q: How can I listen to Political Junkie on the internet? I live in San Diego, and I can't get the political junkie through my NPR local station. \u2014 Ernesto Mendoza, San Diego, Calif. A: I assume you're talking about the Wednesday Political Junkie segment on Talk of the Nation. It's usually available by 6 pm Eastern time the day of the show at http://www.npr.org/programs/talk-of-the-nation. The Junkie segment also can be heard on iTunes as a separate podcast. You can just go to the iTunes web site and subscribe to it there. But I also post the links on Twitter and my Facebook page. Q: I so wish Jon Huntsman would become the presidential candidate for the Americans Elect movement. He is a Republican who makes sense. I was furious when I read that he was uninvited from attending a Republican fundraiser in Florida recently because of his views. Agree? \u2014 Roberta Brown, Santa Fe, N.M. A: Huntsman made headlines when his invitation to speak before a GOP fundraiser in Florida was rescinded. His response: \"This is what they do in China on party matters if you talk off script.\" That's a nice soundbyte, but there's more to the story than just speaking off script. Huntsman has been a bit critical of Mitt Romney as of late, which is fine, but he also said encouraging things about a third party. It's difficult, in my mind at least, to consider inviting someone to appear at a Republican fundraiser when he has been going around the country calling for a third party. As for the Americans Elect movement, it is no longer. The group, which has spent some $35 million thus far with the goal of getting on all 51 ballots with an online convention-chosen centrist independent presidential candidate (and a VP candidate of the opposite party), was doing well with ballot access \u2014 they made it to 28 as of this week. But this week was also the group's deadline for coming up with a candidate, and it couldn't. The criteria: 10,000 online signatures. No one reached that number (former Louisiana Gov. Buddy Roemer got 6,000), and the group says it is shutting down. Edition 300 of the podcast. Well, we made it. The drug-induced experiment that began in 2006 \u2014 the weekly podcast entitled \"It's All Politics\" \u2014 had its 300th episode this week. To celebrate the occasion, Ron Elving, NPR's Senior Washington editor and my co-conspirator in the podcast, made a cake that had an outline of the state of Arizona on it, with the locale of Yuma singled out; what better way to acknowledge one of the six jokes I constantly use on the podcast? As always, this week's episode discussed the current political events. But we also brought back some great moments of the past. And we read some of the wonderful tributes sent in from The Listener. And speaking of The Listener, here are some more of the lovely notes that filled my in-box this week: Ming Diaz: Your formula keeps me glued to my work computer every week. In our facility there are co-workers who also listen and bring their \"Did you get the one where Ken/Ron said....\" into my lab or meetings. Thank you. No other media source comes close to the rapier wit, the direct and sharp poke, the dismissal and move on to the next target. Emma Hollister: What I love most about the podcast are all of the dorky political puns and jokes. They are usually the kind of terrible jokes my dad would make (I really mean that in a good way) and they make me chuckle and groan in turns. Thank you for all the chuckles and groans, the occasional stunned silence and full-on belly laugh. It's been a good first 300 episodes. Laurie Larson: Congratulations on the 300th podcast! I thought it was a lot more ... but I think that's because I listen twice to make sure I savor all the puns. Ryan Cecil Smith: You guys provide my favorite political conversation and bad humor every week. I hope you'll keep it up for 300 more. Sean Walbeck: My favorite moment is a selfish one \u2014 I pointed out in an e-mail Orrin Hatch's previous presidential run when Ron & Ken had forgotten it during a discussion of Mitt Romney's unique position of being a Mormon presidential candidate. My correction was not only noted in the next Podcast, but I was identified as The Listener! ... Meanwhile, about a month later, somebody else was named The Listener. How could you that to me, guys? I thought we had something beautiful here. I'm not enough Listener for you? Well, you're not losing me that easy, misters. I care enough about this relationship enough for the three of us, and if you stumble trying to find joy with other ears out there, you just know I'm here to take you back and listen, no judgment, until you realize the good thing you've got going here. We'll get through this rough patch together. Ceara: My favorite moment? The Eric Massa tickle scandal. Simon Cheng: I'm writing from Hangzhou, China. Believe it or not, I started to follow It's All Politics podcast from episode 5. Congratulations for making it this far and thank you guys for providing me with analysis and jokes about U.S. politics ... though, coming from a Chinese background, some of the jokes I never understood. Maura Spiegelman: Ken made a throw-away joke in a 2006 podcast that I still laugh when I think about it. I believe Ron was listing newly-elected Democratic senators, and Ken interrupted to add \"Amy Keloheinu\" to the list. There was no pause for laughter or even any acknowledgement of it, but I've thought about this joke every time I've heard a reference to Senator Amy Klobuchar in the past five and a half years. Well done. Taylor Henninger: My favorite thing about the podcast is that it always catches me up on the latest thing, so I don't have to subject myself to the cable news networks to find out about the most recent gaffe or engineered scandal. I can still be in-the-know around the water cooler without having to watch another purposeless hologram on CNN. Barry Murphy: Writing from Dublin, Ireland. I've been listening to the podcast for about 4 years now. Your style is about right - informative, erudite, irreverent and doesn't outstay its welcome. Keep up the good work. Charles St. Onge: I can't tell you how many times I get in the car, smile, and think: \"there's a new episode of 'It's All Politics' on the iPod today!\" Janine Blaeloch: It was when you hummed \"Hurdy Gurdy Man\" in mock-Donovan Leitch heavy vibrato. Hilarious! I have come to love your puns. Jack Goodman: I'm writing to let you know that I am The Listener, at least as far as Australia goes. I've been listening since podcast #1. I was so impressed with Ken's call predicting Ned Lamont would defeat Joe Lieberman in the 2006 Democratic primary for Senate in Connecticut. I had to wait for another 290 or so podcasts until Ron figured out the exact date when Rick Santorum would throw in the towel. At this rate, I'm guessing you guys will nail the 2018 mid-term elections. Looking forward to that one. P.S. My wife hates your podcast. She says it makes politics sound like a game or sport. Then again, she's Australian, and politics generally involves public blood-letting here. Sam Blatt: My favorite moment was when Ron said with absolute certainty that Rick Santorum would drop out at the beginning of the next week. I didn't think he would do it so soon, and I really thought Ron was wrong. When I heard the announcement, the first thing that I thought was, \"Ron was right!\" You guys are a great combination, and I've enjoyed listening to your podcast for the last couple of years. Keep it up! Nathan Leitner: Although I have only been religiously listening to your podcast since January of this year, I already have many fond memories of listening to It's All Politics \u2014 usually during slow Friday afternoons in the office or driving home for the weekend. Either way I'm generally left in stitches (harder to explain in the office than alone in a car) and a healthy dose of topical, political knowledge. But honestly, I probably would have been a much better student of political science had I had you two as professors and had I been such a NPR addict as an undergrad. Paula Fitzgerald: As for my favorite moment - that has to go back to the 2008 election, and the coverage of Sarah Palin. The Saturday Night Live coverage got all of the attention, as Tina Fey was so dead on. But the It's All Politics coverage was so much more incisive. I retired five years ago to San Diego, and happily have all the time in the world to indulge my obsession with politics. It's All Politics is so essential to that. Ron and Ken are so well versed, and so entertaining. Tim O'Connor: I've learned more about the political system listening to you for the last three or four years then I did in the proceeding 28. Keep up the great work. I promise to keep listening. Once again, thanks to all who wrote. Thanks to NPR, for allowing Ron and me to blabber on each week for these past six years. Thanks to our long-suffering editor, Cathy Shaw, as well as the podcast producer, Brakkton Booker, as well as a shoutout to our podcast producers of the past: Evie Stone, Muthoni Muturi, Gisele Grayson, Tom Dreisbach and Kimberly Adams \u2014 who have made each episode a memorable one.

U.S. factories have boosted output, and busier factories are helping drive the U.S. economy. Hourly workers at General Motors will soon be getting profit-sharing checks of up to $7,000 each after the automaker reported record earnings this week.  President Obama may also get a political dividend, two and a half years after a government-engineered turnaround. Obama reminded a group of United Auto Worker members this week that, back in 2009, his rescue of GM and Chrysler had plenty of critics. Opponents of the auto rescue included Republican White House hopefuls Rick Santorum and Mitt Romney, who were both campaigning in Michigan this week. Santorum told the Detroit Economic Club the right way to deal with the automakers' problems in 2009 was to let the free market work. \"Would the auto industry look different than it does today?  Yes, it would be,\" Santorum said. \"Would it still be alive and well? I think it would be alive and equally as well, if not better.\" Santorum is running on a pro-manufacturing platform, stressing his roots in blue-collar Pennsylvania, as well as a tax plan that would make factories tax-free. While other candidates talk about training programs for would-be factory workers, Santorum complains that government handouts are discouraging industrial work. \"When you have 99 weeks of unemployment benefits and you have a variety of other social safety-net programs, people can make choices that they otherwise wouldn't make if the economy was not one that government dependency was the watchword,\" he said. Romney, whose father once ran an auto company, says he's glad that GM and Chrysler have rebounded, but he continues to criticize President Obama's handling of the auto rescue.  Romney calls it an example of crony capitalism, because the autoworkers' union that supported Obama emerged with a stake in the companies. \"When a president of the United States begins taking your money to give to his donors, that's a problem,\" Romney said. While Romney regularly criticizes those he calls \"union stooges,\" Obama stressed cooperation between labor and management when he visited a unionized Master Lock plant in Milwaukee this week. That cooperation has allowed CEO John Heppner to bring about 100 jobs back to the U.S. from China over the last year and a half. \"We figured out how to make this facility productive. It's about trust,\" Heppner said. \"We care more about mutual success than our own.\" Nationwide, factories have added more than 400,000 jobs over the last two years. Obama wants to encourage more hiring, but part of the success of these factories is their ability to do more with fewer workers. Veteran tool-and-die maker Don Olson says the Master Lock plant employs only about a third as many people as when he started 25 years ago.  Back then, much of the work was done by hand. \"It looked like something out of the '40s, but they really automated since then,\" Olson said. \"That's the only way we're bringing these jobs back. \"We're well-paid and we have a good benefits package, and in order to maintain that, you've got to make a lot of locks per person,\" he says. Master Lock makes more padlocks than anyone else in the world. Heppner joked about all the locks that weren't being made at Master Lock during the hours of preparation for the president's visit.  But soon after the president left, the Master Lock employees were back at those automated machines making more locks \u2014 faster than ever.",

All four of the remaining GOP candidates for president have proposed steep cuts in business and personal taxes, and it sometimes seems like Republicans are competing to show the most enthusiasm for tax cuts. At a debate last month, former Sen. Rick Santorum said tax cuts were needed to get the economy thriving again \u2014 even if they benefit the wealthy. \"We need to have as much money funneling through this economy as possible, and the people who make those investments are people who have resources and wealth,\" Santorum said. \"We want them to deploy that wealth in the most productive way possible.\" The candidates all want to keep the George W. Bush-era tax cuts in place. They also want to get rid of the estate tax for good and lower taxes on corporations; but there are differences among them. Corporate Taxes Curtis Dubay of the Heritage Foundation says the plans put forward by Santorum and former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney are a bit less ambitious than the others. \"Those plans work within the confines of the system we have today,\" Dubay says. \"They look to make improvements around the edges, whereas if you were going to go with Speaker [Newt] Gingrich's plan or Congressman [Ron] Paul's plan, those plans would really have to blow up the whole system and start from scratch.\" Romney wants to lower the corporate tax from 35 percent to 25 percent and cut capital gains taxes for households earning less than $200,000 a year. He also says he likes the idea of an overhaul of the tax code down the road. As a multimillionaire, Romney would actually fare much less well under his own plan than under the one put forward by Gingrich. The former House speaker wants to eliminate capital gains taxes altogether and lower corporate taxes to 12.5 percent, which would be among the lowest in the world. Do this, he says, and investment dollars will flow back into the country. Competing Systems But critics like William Gale of the Brookings Institution say Gingrich's plan would cost the Treasury some $800 billion a year. \"Gingrich's plan is both extremely expensive in terms of lost revenue and extremely regressive in terms of providing huge benefits for households at the top of the income distribution,\" he says. But Gingrich shrugs off such criticism. \"My goal is to shrink the government to fit the revenue,\" he said, \"not to raise the revenue to catch up with the government.\" Gingrich's plan is less radical than that of Ron Paul. The Texas congressman says for now, he favors a flat tax; but his ultimate goal is to get rid of the income tax altogether. \"My goal is to get rid of the 16th Amendment,\" he said. \"The only way you can do that is not run a welfare system and a warfare system in policing the world.\" As for Santorum, he has proposed reducing the number of tax rates to just two, at 10 and 28 percent. That would greatly simplify the tax code \u2014 something a lot of Republicans and Democrats favor. But Santorum also wants to triple the child tax credit and give tax breaks to manufacturers. Dubay of the Heritage Foundation says that doesn't set right with a lot of conservatives. Costs Of Lower Taxes \"One thing that [as] conservatives we try to focus on is not having the tax code pick winners and losers in the marketplace,\" he says. \"That's one area where Sen. Santorum will get push-back from economic conservatives.\" But Gale of the Brookings Institution says there's a bigger problem with all of these plans: The country just can't afford them. \"It's delusional for the discussion in the policy circles to be about whether we extend the Bush tax cuts and have a 2 or 6 or $10 trillion tax cut on top of that when what we have is looming budget deficits as far as the eye can see,\" he says. But for the Republican Party, lower taxes remain the elixir that can help make the U.S. economy prosper again \u2014 and whoever wins the nomination will have to prove to voters he can carry that banner forward.",

David Axelrod, President Obama's political strategist, has what appears to be \u2014 from outside the president's re-election campaign, at least \u2014 a problem. Back in early 2009, when the Obama presidency was still brand new, the president gave that NBC News interview in which he talked about his administration being a \"one-term proposition\" if the economy didn't snap back in time for his re-election. Three years later, and the U.S. economy, while improved, still feels to too many Americans like it's still in recession. Meanwhile, Mitt Romney, the front-runner for the Republican presidential nomination, keeps reminding voters of Obama's \"one-term proposition\" comment every chance he gets. In an interview scheduled to air Friday, Morning Edition co-host Steve Inskeep asked Axelrod how the Obama campaign intends to deal with what seems like the president's 2009 argument against his own re-election. Axelrod indicated that the campaign's argument for a second term will be that the president's policies have helped improve the economy significantly since that 2009 interview \u2014 though the recovery is still a work in progress. Axelrod: \"I'm saying that the president said we need to turn the economy around and show a real improvement in three years, and I think we have shown a real improvement. I am not in any way suggesting we don't have more work to do, nor is he. \"But it took years to get into this mess, Steve, and it's going to take a while longer than anybody would want to get out of it. \"The question is, are we moving in the right direction and do we think going back to the same politics that created the crisis are somehow a wise way to go? I don't think the American people believe that.\" In other words, the Obama campaign argument will be a variation of the \"it could have been much worse\" argument. That isn't necessarily the most promising case for a president seeking a second term \u2014 which Steve pointed out to Axelrod. INSKEEP: \"You're a pro. Isn't this a tough argument to make?\" Being the pro that he is, Axelrod side-stepped the question. AXELROD: \"Look, first of all let's set aside the politics for a second and understand this has been a tough time for our country ...\" Axelrod, who exited his job last year as a top White House aide to return to his native Chicago, left little doubt that Romney's track record as a top executive in the private-equity industry will be grist for the Obama campaign. Romney himself has made that experience central to his candidacy. Asked if he would be recycling charges made by Newt Gingrich against Romney in the Republican primaries, Axelrod said: \"I don't like to think of myself as recycling anything that Newt Gingrich does.\" As if to prove that point, Axelrod made an argument against Romney that Gingrich would be very unlikely to make, because it has growing income inequality at its heart. Romney doesn't get it, Axelrod said: The problem with the economy is that in recent decades, increasing amounts of the national income have been swept into the bank and the investment accounts of those at the very top of the income distribution; meanwhile, he said, American workers, more productive than ever, got the short end. Obama's strategist said he recently listened to Romney tell a woman at  a televised campaign event that higher productivity equals higher income. AXELROD: \"In that one sentence, he misses the whole problem. Productivity hasn't equaled income for a long time. Income has been flat. Productivity has been rising precipitously. The gains have been captured by the people at the top, but most Americans haven't progressed. We need to build an economy in which most Americans capture those gains themselves, and we see a growing middle class, and our standard of living improves, and the future for our children have bright prospects. That is the economy we're fighting for.\" He expects the general-election campaign to be nasty, Axelrod said, given the presence of superPACs. Voters would prefer to hear an uplifting message from a presidential candidate, he said. AXELROD: \"I can only tell you from our standpoint we believe that the president, or anybody who wants to be president, has to project a positive vision about where they want to take this country, has to give people a sense of that path forward. And if all you're doing is running down the other candidate and, also, running down America, I don't think you're going to be successful. And that's not the kind of candidate and that's not the kind of president Barack Obama has been or will be.\"",

A day after delivering his State of the Union address to Congress, President Obama took his message on the road. Obama hoped that stops at manufacturing sites in Iowa and Arizona would drive home his point that the government should do more to encourage factory jobs. The three-day trip also includes stops in Colorado, Nevada and Michigan.  Those are all states likely to be important in the November election. Obama kicked off his road trip at Conveyor Engineering and Manufacturing, a factory in Cedar Rapids, Iowa. Though Conveyor is not a particularly big company \u2014 just 65 workers \u2014 it hopes to double in size in the next several years. The Hawkeye State is home to a significant number of factories. And manufacturing is one of the central \"pillars\" in Obama's blueprint for a stronger U.S. economy. It's also been a relative bright spot in the U.S. economy. The auto industry in particular has rebounded with the help of the government's rescue of General Motors and Chrysler. Speaking to a crowd at Conveyor, Obama said the U.S. auto industry has added some 160,000 jobs in the past two years. \"Today, the American auto industry is  back,\" Obama said. \"And I want what's happening in Detroit to happen in other  industries. I want it to happen in Cleveland and Pittsburgh and Raleigh.  And I want it to happen right here in Cedar Rapids, Iowa.\" Obama also spoke fondly of the Iowa caucuses that launched his national political career four years ago. But it's not just nostalgia that brought him to Cedar Rapids. Iowa, like all the states he's visiting this week, is important to the president's re-election chances. While Iowa is perhaps better known for corn and soybeans, the state is also home to a significant number of factories. \"The eastern part of the state along the Mississippi River is an area that is well-known historically for its farm machinery, construction machinery, and a broad array of durable goods manufacturing,\" says Dave Swenson of Iowa State University. Iowa's experience helps illustrate why the administration wants to promote manufacturing. Factory jobs tend to pay higher wages and create a bigger ripple effect in the surrounding economy.  Factories account for just 11 percent of the jobs in Iowa but 17 percent of the state's payroll. In  order to command those high wages, today's factory workers need specialized skills, Swenson says. \"It may have been 25, 30 years ago you didn't even need to go to high school to get a manufacturing job and to have a good life,\" Swenson says. \"Those days are rapidly going away. You need to be able to operate computer equipment, you need to be able to operate computer-driven machine tools. Then, you need to have quantitative problem-solving skills.\" Skilled workers and advanced equipment are helping to make U.S. factories more productive than ever and most cost-competitive with rivals overseas. Obama wants the federal government to encourage that trend. \"We've got to seize that opportunity,\" Obama said. \"We've  got to help these companies succeed. And it starts with changing our tax  code.\" Obama announced during his State of the Union address Tuesday that his upcoming budget will propose a series of tax breaks to reward companies for locating factory jobs in the U.S., while eliminating breaks for companies that move jobs offshore. It's not at all clear that Congress will go along with those changes. But by making the case, Obama is also trying to make a larger argument about the role of government: He hopes to show that his controversial rescue of the auto industry has paid off and that prosperity is greatest when it's most widely shared. \"You know, this country only exists because generations of Americans worked together, and looked out for each other, and believed that we're stronger when we rise together,\" he said. That's a pillar not only of the president's economic blueprint, but also of his re-election campaign.",

David Rothkopf is a visiting scholar at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace and author of the upcoming Power, Inc. First day back at work in the New Year. Blearily open eyes on computer screen.  First story I see: Muslim Brotherhood says they won't recognize Israel. Second story: Muslim Brotherhood closer to running lower house in Egyptian parliament. Third story: Islamists form government in Morocco. Next story: Israelis, prepare for peace talks by announcing new construction beyond Green Line in Jerusalem. Next story: Iranian rattling sabers in the Gulf. Next story: Taliban setting up shop in Qatar thanks to rapprochement with government. Next story: Arab League sham intervention in Syria going nowhere fast. Seriously. That's how 2012 started for me. So, the question is: what's a guy supposed to think? Is it that 2011 was the year of giddy \u2014 and utterly unfounded \u2014 optimism about the Middle East? The only person who could possibly read all those stories and be happy is Bibi Netanyahu.  With elections expected in Israel this year, nothing could do more for his election chances than to have all his worst predictions about the aftermath of Arab Spring and the increasing Iranian threat appear to be coming true. All the intolerance, abuse, violence, and exacerbation of the country's problems associated with the Israeli far right and all the missteps of the Israeli Prime Minister himself may seem small price to pay if the country feels a vice grip of insecurity tightening around it throughout the year. That's not to say I actually think that Netanyahu's combativeness and pedantry actually helps anything. I don't. It's actually more a way of saying that as bad as I think this morning's first news dump was for me, I can't help but feel worse is in store. Beyond the problems that seem certain to deepen between Israel and the Palestinians, within Syria, with the rise of intransigent Islamic political parties, and with Iran, we also have Iraq seemingly heading straight back to the emergency room of geopolitics and, if anything, the deal the U.S. seems likely to cut with the devils we know in Afghanistan promises even less satisfactory outcomes. Furthermore, none of these pessimistic analyzes actually have to pan out in the long run to actually have really negative consequences. For example, one of the more positive stories of the morning was the announcement that U.S. Defense Secretary Panetta was preparing a plan to cut $450 billion in U.S. defense spending over the next decade. This is in line with the very modest 8 percent cuts the administration had planned. And it's an important step in the right direction. Almost certainly the greatest, most damaging strategic error the U.S. has made during the past couple decades is continuing our over-the-top defense spending. We have spent at many times the level we need to protect ourselves \u2014 indeed, we have spent at a level at which the economic damage we have done the country (both in terms of deficits created and in terms of the opportunity cost of investing in our military rather than in more productive segments of the economy) vastly outstrips any potential security benefits that may have been derived.  Certainly, that's been true since the fall of the USSR. In all likelihood it was true long before that. We could cut the budget five times the level proposed and still be outspending our nearest rival many times over. But, if the Middle East \u2014 which I would argue is not and should not be our primary security focus \u2014 festers and boils this year as today's headlines suggest it might, then it is easy to imagine a central debate of this year's elections in the U.S. being about whether or not we should cut defense spending at all. A President with an exemplary record in terms of combating terror and getting the U.S. out of costly conflicts will suddenly find that Republicans will be able to open a different front on the national security debate where he may appear vulnerable. They will say the world is more dangerous and this is no time to be cutting defense. And my guess is that means that when the time comes to really cut the budget nothing like these cuts will be made...and the U.S. will continue to pose the greatest danger to itself by over-spending on wasteful, bloated, duplicative defense systems it can't and shouldn't attempt to afford. The Panetta $450 billion plan will be seen as the high bid in terms of cuts and we will negotiate downward from there. The changes will be incremental and we will continue down the path to great power decline long ago limned by Paul Kennedy. Take that and the real threats posed by the ever changing landscape in the Middle East \u2014 uncertainty in North Korea, the rise of ever more important security challenges in Asia, the problems in the Eurozone, and bird flu (I saw \"Contagion\"...I know what we're up against!  I saw Gwyneth Paltrow's brain!) \u2014 and my newest New Year's resolution is to go back to bed, pull the covers over my head and wait for 2013.",
