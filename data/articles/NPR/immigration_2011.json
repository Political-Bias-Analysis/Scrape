            "article_content": "A relatively small election is getting intense interest in Arizona. It's an election to recall State Sen. Russell Pearce, the architect of Arizona's strict immigration laws. As NPR's Ted Robbins reports, the recall election is splitting the community along religious as much as political lines.  SCOTT SIMON, HOST: A relatively small election in Arizona is drawing intense interest. It's a vote to recall state Senator Russell Pearce. Senator Pearce is the architect of Arizona's strict immigration laws, most notably SB 1070, requiring police to question people's immigration status. NPR's Ted Robbins reports that the recall election is splitting the community along religious as much as political lines. TED ROBBINS, BYLINE: More than 60 members of the media packed into an auditorium already crowded with supporters, all there for a debate between senate candidates for Arizona Legislative District 18. LD18 is in Mesa, a largely Mormon community. Both candidates are Mormon and Republican. UNIDENTIFIED MAN: I'd like to introduce Jerry Lewis. (SOUNDBITE OF APPLAUSE) UNIDENTIFIED MAN: And also the president of our senate, Senator Russell Pearce. (SOUNDBITE OF CHEERING) ROBBINS: Clearly, this is no ordinary local election, though for the first hour of the debate, it seemed like it. Both men described themselves as conservative Republicans, anti-tax, small government, pro-business. Then, candidate Jerry Lewis was asked how he'd attract business to Arizona. His response? Start by changing the state's image. JERRY LEWIS: We are seen as a very unfriendly business state. We are seen as something akin to maybe 1964 Alabama. People do not want to move their businesses here. (SOUNDBITE OF BOOING) ROBBINS: That answer, and the audience response, hint at what this election is really all about: whether or not Russell Pearce's forceful focus on immigration has been good or bad for Arizona. Jerry Lewis says SB 1070 has caused boycotts which cost the state money and given it a black eye. Russell Pearce says Arizona has rid itself of illegal immigrants who cost the state money, and now other places are following Arizona's lead. STATE SENATOR RUSSELL PEARCE: You know, 30 states are writing model legislation after what Arizona has done. We are in the front of the parade, we have changed the debate in Washington, D.C. in a good way. ROBBINS: In this case, in this place, which side of the immigration issue a voter is on may depend on their interpretation of Mormon doctrine. Whether, like Russell Pearce, the rule of law is most important, or, like Jerry Lewis, that the church's higher value is to welcome the stranger. DAVE RICHINS: This is, at its very core, Mormon families that are offended by a certain style of politics. ROBBINS: Dave Richins is on the Mesa City Council. RICHINS: A certain way of politicking is putting a bad name on a church that they love and an LDS church who has worked locally, statewide, nationally and internationally to develop a reputation of inclusion. ROBBINS: The LDS Church has not taken a position on Arizona's legislation, but it has officially said that an enforcement-only approach is inadequate. Voters I spoke with outside the debate reflected the split Dave Richins has observed. Itzel Carreon says Russell Pearce gives a bad name to the district and to her Mormon faith. ITZEL CARREON: He's not a man of family values. I mean, Prop 300, SB 1070, that's not Christ-like legislation. ROBBINS: Ron Widders is proud of what Russell Pearce has done in Arizona. He said he resents Jerry Lewis' comparison to racially intolerant 1964 Alabama. RON WIDDERS: I don't believe that for a minute. That was just a big mistake that he made, but that's a rookie. ROBBINS: Jerry Lewis has never run for office before. He's a CPA, a school administrator and a local Mormon Church official. Russell Pearce is a former sheriff's deputy and a long-time legislator. There's a third candidate on the ballot, Olivia Cortes, whose name remains though she quit after a judge said there was evidence that she was recruited by Pearce supporters to siphon-off Lewis votes. This is a local election, but if Arizona's powerful Senate President Russell Pearce is ousted next month it will affect the state's agenda, and on the immigration issue, it could affect the rest of the nation.

            "article_content": "The architect of Arizona's strict anti-immigration law has lost a recall election. State Senate president Russell Pearce lost to a fellow Republican.  ROBERT SIEGEL, HOST: As we've heard, voters in Mesa, Arizona, changed the complexion of that state's immigration debate. They threw out state senate president Russell Pearce, the man behind every one of Arizona's controversial immigration laws. NPR's Ted Robbins has that story. TED ROBBINS, BYLINE: Republican Russell Pearce had the support of nearly every elected Republican in Arizona and every anti-immigration organization in the country. But he lost his recall election by 8 percentage points. Pearce told supporters that he accepted the loss as the price of keeping his word. RUSSELL PEARCE: I've always put my loyalty to this Republic, the rule of law and the moral principles that folks have died for from the beginning of this great Republic, ahead of any personal interest. ROBBINS: Over the last decade, Pearce has written and pushed through state laws prohibiting illegal immigrants from using state services, sanctions against employers who hire illegal immigrants and most notably, SB-1070, the law requiring local police to question the immigration status of people they stop. Here he is a couple of years ago explaining his quest. PEARCE: I will not back off until we resolve this problem of this illegal invasion. Invaders, that's what they are. They're invaders on the American sovereignty and it can't be tolerated. ROBBINS: Pearce, a former sheriff's deputy, was called a hero by some and a racist by others, but his dogged focus on immigration and the rule of law may be what did him in. His senate district in Mesa is strongly Mormon. Pearce is Mormon. But the LDS Church itself has said it supports more moderate approaches to the immigration issue and Pearce's opponent exploited that. Jerry Lewis is also a Mormon Republican. In his victory speech, Lewis, an assistant school district superintendent, stressed civility and moderation. JERRY LEWIS: We ran a clean and civil campaign. We set out to show the world that we're serious about being different than the status quo. We ignored the attacks and launched none of our own. Let's continue to take the high ground. ROBBINS: Lewis said he wants to change Arizona's image and he vowed to work with Democrats and fellow Republicans. He certainly could not have won without them. Hispanics, for instance, mounted a heavy get out the vote effort against Pearce. Republican Mesa city councilman Dave Richins, a Lewis supporter, says the campaign targeted Hispanic Mormons as well. DAVE RICHINS: There are more Spanish-speaking members of the LDS Church than there are English-speaking members and that perception of inclusion is very important to the image of the church, to its missionary work and other programs, humanitarian programs worldwide. ROBBINS: Richins says he hopes the Pearce recall means an end to shrill winner-take-all politics, but the state is committed to defending SB-1070 in federal court and Arizona Governor Jan Brewer is touring the country with a new book promoting her hard-nosed tactics. But Russell Pearce was the state senate president. He can no longer set the legislative agenda and his voice no longer represents Arizona state government. Ted Robbins, NPR News, Mesa.

            "article_content": "Yesterday, I published a post exploring how NPR, and other media outlets, use labels in politics. The column was prompted by an NPR report describing the Norwegian Progress Party, but the issue is broader. That particular party has been in the news because Anders Behring Breivik, who admitted to killing 77 people in Norway, is a former Progress Party member. Today we're adding an academic perspective from Professor Cas Mudde of DePauw University, a scholar on radical right politics, especially in Europe. He shares three questions that help label the Progress Party and other parties like it. Mudde chose \"populist right-wing\" to describe the Progress Party. Why populist?The party's narrative pits \"the pure people\" against \"the corrupt elite.\" Why right-wing?It accepts the existence of socio-cultural and socio-economic differences between people and doesn't want the state to equalize them. It strongly supports a free-market economy. Their small state and free-market combination is more like the United States' Republican Party, Mudde wrote, than the European radical right, which supports a more active role of the state in the market. Why not radical?Nativism (the policy of protecting native inhabitants over immigrants) is not central to the party's ideology. While its election propaganda might emphasize immigration, and individual members and/or representatives might make nativist statements, Mudde wrote that their party program hardly touches on immigration. Labeling Breivik requires a further distinction \u2013 radical v. extreme. Breivik's views represent the \"extreme right\" rather than \"radical right,\" Mudde wrote. Why extreme?Breivik no longer believed in the democratic process. Breivik \"preferred violence over the parliamentary way.\" Radical right parties, by Mudde's definition, do not promote violence. Mudde's prescription may seem like a lot of hairsplitting, but it does have the advantage of being systematic and transparent. Could it be the basis for a policy guideline for NPR and other news media? Do you have other suggestions? Andrew Maddocks contributed to this post.",

            "article_content": "Mexican soldiers have taken control of the police department in downtown Matamoros, in the border state of Tamaulipas.\n                \n                    \n                    Jason Beaubien/NPR\n                    \n                \nhide caption Mexican soldiers have taken control of the police department in downtown Matamoros, in the border state of Tamaulipas. In Mexico, one controversial part of President Felipe Calderon's war against the drug cartels has been the use of the military to fight organized crime. Now in the border state of Tamaulipas, the Mexican army is taking over full control of the police departments in some of the state's most troubled cities. In May, municipal police across Tamaulipas were ordered to turn in their weapons. This week 3,000 armed reinforcements from the military finally arrived to help patrol the state. The Mexican government sent soldiers to replace police in 22 municipalities, including the border cities of Nuevo Laredo, Reynosa and Matamoros. Outside the main police station in Matamoros \u2014 across the border from Brownsville, Texas \u2014 scores of police officers lounge around in the parking lot. Others sit idly in the lobby. They're in uniform but their weapons are conspicuously absent from their holsters. All of the city's police, except for the traffic cops, have been ordered to stay in their barracks. Police Chief Gabriel Lopez Ordaz says the directive came from Mexico City. \"They think that many police could be involved in criminal activities,\" he says. Ever since the Zetas drug cartel broke from the Gulf cartel two years ago and the gangs began battling for control of Tamaulipas, the state has appeared to be beyond the control of authorities. Criminals have been operating with impunity, and authorities say this could only happen with police involvement. A State Convulsed By Violence Lopez is a career military officer who spent 36 years in the Mexican army. He became police chief in Matamoros just five months ago. Lopez says all of his police officers will have to go through a rigorous confidence test that includes psychological and drug screening. \"So we know that we have trustworthy police,\" Lopez says. Those who pass the confidence test will then be sent to a retraining program. Lopez says it could be almost a year before the officers are allowed to return to the streets. For now, only the bodyguards for the police chief and the mayor have been allowed to still carry their weapons. The state of Tamaulipas has been convulsed by violence recently. In June of last year, the leading candidate for governor was gunned down just days before the gubernatorial election. In September, 72 migrants were found executed on a ranch. Two months ago, authorities uncovered a series of mass graves in San Fernando that held more than 180 bodies. Gun battles in Matamoros between authorities and the Zetas or Gulf cartel sometimes rage in the streets for hours. Lopez is a military man, and he accepts the order to pull his police officers off the street, but he says it's going to be hard for just 200 soldiers to replace almost 600 local cops. \"First of all, because these are people who aren't from here,\" the police chief says. \"The soldiers don't know the terrain, they don't know the population. They don't really know the situation. So it's going to take some time for them to get positive results.\" Concerns About 'Militarization' Of Police The Chamber of Commerce in Matamoros issued a statement saying they're concerned about the \"militarization\" of the police force and called on the soldiers to respect the human rights of the local citizens. Enrique Mena Saenz, the secretary of the chamber, says he worries that the soldiers will only focus on the drug cartels and other organized crime while ignoring petty crime. Mena says a week and a half ago someone broke into his yard and stole the water pipes on the side of his house to sell the copper for scrap. \"And they left me with all the damage,\" he says. The soldiers who now patrol Matamoros are unlikely to recover his lost plumbing. Pickup trucks loaded with heavily armed troops race through the streets in convoys. The soldiers were given maps to help get themselves acquainted with the city. Federal officials, however, say this is an important strategy to regain control of Tamaulipas. They say the presence of the military will give cities time to purge their notoriously corrupt police departments and then build new ones.",

            "article_content": "As the immigrant population continues growing and federal lawmakers fail to pass immigration reform, state legislators are taking matters into their own hands. Alabama Republican Governor Robert Bentley signed a tough bill last week. One of its four components criminalizes a person to be in the state without proper documentation. Host Michel Martin looks at that law with The Montgomery Advertiser state reporter Brian Lyman. Latino Decisions pollster Matt Barreto also shares how immigration reform may affect the 2012 election.  MICHEL MARTIN, host: I'm Michel Martin, and this is TELL ME MORE, from NPR News. The doors to the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau open next month, but Congress is still fighting over how much power it should have. So, what will this agency really be able to do? We'll talk about that in a few minutes. But first, we take a look at immigration, which was front and center at the Republican presidential candidates debate last night in New Hampshire. We want to talk about how states are handling immigration. With Congress unable to act on immigration reform, leaders of several states are taking matters into their own hands. Alabama's Republican governor Robert Bentley is the latest. He signed a strict immigration enforcement bill last week. We wanted to hear more about this, so we caught up with Brian Lyman. He's a reporter with The Montgomery Advertiser who's been covering this. He's with us from The Advertiser's newsroom in Alabama. Brian, thanks for joining us. BRIAN LYMAN: Thanks for having me. MARTIN: Tell us exactly what this law would do. LYMAN: The law is a very sweeping anti-illegal immigration bill. Among other things it does is it makes it a state crime to be in the state without documentation, requires schools to collect information on the citizenship or immigration status of the students, and it also requires all businesses in the state to enroll in the federal E-Verify program. MARTIN: To verify whether the people that they hire have the legal right to work in this country. How does this legislation compare with the other bills that we've heard about from Arizona and Georgia that got so many headlines? And we know that Arizona and Georgia's laws are already being challenged in court and it appears that the Arizona case is eventually headed to the Supreme Court. So much attention to this legislation. Was Alabama's move based on that? LYMAN: Alabama's law incorporates many of Arizona's - the language in Arizona is law verbatim. The language, for instance, entrapment and the hiring of certain workers comes almost unaltered from the Arizona bill. It does add a couple of things that are not in the Arizona bill. For instance, the verification of student citizenship or immigration status, but it is very, very similar to an SB1070. MARTIN: Now, one of the complaints about the Arizona and Georgia bills is that this would inevitably lead to racial profiling because it required a suspicion of questions about status. And so, the question people have is what is going to be the basis of this reasonable suspicion? Is it going to be anybody who's brown, anybody who doesn't have an expensive car? I mean, what is that? So, the question I would have is that since the Alabama law came after these, did they make any effort in drafting the law to address some of the objections that people have made in other states? LYMAN: There are provisions in the law. In fact, there are several paragraphs in the law that specifically ban the use of racial profiling in enforcing the law. However, that reasonable suspicion language in the bill has drawn criticism from opponents of the law who say that this law is simply unenforceable without racial profiling, because there are no provisions in the law that say exactly how a law enforcement officer is supposed to use reasonable suspicion in determining or judging the immigration or citizenship status of somebody they stop. MARTIN: If you're just joining us this is TELL ME MORE from NPR News. We're talking about state immigration laws with Brian Lyman. He's a state capital reporter with The Montgomery Advertiser. Alabama's Republican Governor Robert Bentley just signed a tough new immigration enforcement bill last week. It's being described as the toughest in the country. Now, we want to get a national perspective, so we're going to bring Matt Barreto into the conversation. He's a pollster with Latino decisions. He's a professor of political science at the University of Washington. He's with us from Seattle Met. Thanks for joining us once again. MATT BARRETO: Sure thing. MARTIN: Now, immigration was front and center last night at the Republican presidential candidates' debate in Manchester, New Hampshire. One of the candidates Newt Gingrich, former speaker of the house, former lawmaker from Georgia, congressman, had this to say. (SOUNDBITE OF DEBATE) NEWT GINGRICH: And first of all, you control the border. We can ask the National Guard to go to Iraq. We ask the National Guard to go to Kuwait. We ask the National Guard to go to Afghanistan. Somehow we would have done more for American security if we had had the National Guard on the border. But, you know... MARTIN: Most of the candidates speaking last night had, you know, forceful comments about the need to crackdown on illegal immigration. So, Matt, you know, it's one of these issues that's been so much a part of our political debate for years now. Has the - what's the word I'm looking for - has the action moved to the states in the absence of a federal response? BARRETO: Yeah. I think that's part of what's happening here. And you sense that in the frustration of the voice of the speaker when he made those comments. You know, equating the border, and presumably he was talking about the U.S.-Mexico border as he went on to say later in the debate, with these other international wars and sending military personnel there. And so, there's a real sense of frustration. And I think that the federal government is to blame for that. And so, many states and many governors are looking at issues related to immigration in their state and saying, hey, if the federal government isn't going to do something, we want to try to start addressing some of these issues at the state level. And, unfortunately, what we've been seeing in the last year or so is that many of those pieces of legislation getting passed and signed into law are very, very strict and are casting a very, very white net that are not just targeting or focusing on undocumented immigrants but it could be something, as you mentioned earlier, that does invoke racial profiling. And these states are doing many things that bring up ordinary citizens who may just be friends with undocumented immigrants and they could be criminally liable just for sort of having a friendship with an undocumented immigrant. MARTIN: Well, Matt, how is this playing out politically? I mean, are these measures popular and with whom are they popular? BARRETO: Well, you know, if you look at the general polls of the American public, there's a little bit of a split. So, right in the wake of the Arizona bill, there were polls that suggested that voters supported that, that they were supportive of the seat of Arizona passing that legislation. At the same time, many of the exact same individuals who supported the Arizona immigration law also supported the federal government acting on immigration that would provide a solution to the undocumented immigrants who are living here including a pathway to citizenship. And so, I don't characterize a lot of the polling numbers that I see or even the opinions that I hear as (unintelligible) anti-immigrant. There are people who are upset with the federal government for not moving on immigration and saying now we need some sort of solution. And a lot of times these same folks who might support the new Alabama law would also support some sort of policy that would provide either a guest worker program or for legal status for those undocumented workers who are here and contributing to the state's economy or to the national economy. MARTIN: Brian, one of the things I was interested in is the fact that a number of these aggressive moves have come in Southern states like, of course, you know, Arizona got quite a lot of attention. Utah, Florida, and Texas also had bills that were debated in this legislative session, but South Carolina, Alabama, New Mexico, Georgia seem to have been following the track laid down by Arizona. And I was wondering why do you think that is? I mean, has the immigrant population really grown that much in the South and has there been any, was there any push back against this legislative initiative by the governor? LYMAN: The immigrant community in Alabama has grown considerably over the past 10 years. I can tell you here in Montgomery, there is a sizeable Korean community. But particularly in Northern Alabama, large communities of Mexican and Guatemalan immigrants have emerged over the past 10 years. Now, all that said, Alabama's immigrant population is still very small. It's about 2.9 percent of the entire population. The move for this bill - this has been very popular with Republicans in the state for the past several years to do a bill that would address immigration or undocumented immigrants in the state. Republicans made a bill like this one of the centerpieces of their handshake with Alabama, which was a platform they ran on, which helped them win control of the state legislature in last November's elections. And it proved to be very popular with voters here. BARRETO: This is a very conservative state. And immigration issues like this obviously play very well with conservative voters. And I think the politicians in the state saw it that way. MARTIN: And what about the advocacy groups who say that the bill is just, I mean, setting aside their complaint that it's mean spirited, that it will lead to racial profiling, they said that you cannot make it a crime to exist. Because they say it makes it a state crime to be an illegal immigrant in Alabama. And they say you just simply can't do that. That will not pass constitutional muster. What's been the response to that? BARRETO: Those provisions were in the Arizona law and those have already been staid by federal courts. There will be some legal challenges going on there. I think if you speak to supporters of the this law, if you brought up that provision, that they'll simply say, well, it's, you know, it's a crime to be in this country without proper documentation or without proper papers. And certainly that would be the argument that they would make. MARTIN: Matt, let's finally - a final question to you, is let's take the other side of the question. How are these aggressive moves on immigration, as we saw in the debate last night, seem to be popular with the Republican base? But the Republican Party is becoming more diverse. And I'm interested on how these measures - how are they affecting the standing of the Republican Party with Latino voters who do have the right to vote? BARRETO: Yeah. No, that's an excellent observation. And there are a number of groups that are more conservative or Republican Latino groups who are speaking out against these issues in the South, but mostly in the Southwest with our large numbers of Latinos and saying, hey, we're conservative on some other issues. But we've got to draw the line here. This is not something that we stand for for villainizing our community and creating these policies. And so we find very, very strong opposition to these state laws across party lines. And in our last poll, immigration has become the top issue that Latino voters of all parties want their policymakers in Washington, D.C. to address. It's been getting a lot of attention. The president has been doing outreach and giving speeches. And voters are now saying, hey, let's do something about this. Let's not just let the states run rampant with these laws. MARTIN: Well, just to clarify. You've got new poll results just out from your June 2011 tracking poll of Latino registered voters. Does that indicate an advantage to either political party in addressing this issue? BARRETO: Well, Latino voters are upset with both political parties. On the one hand, our data suggests that a majority of Latinos think the Republicans are blocking immigration reform. And at the same time, when we ask a different question, we find a majority of Latino voters think that the Democrats are not pushing the issue of immigration reform, that they're just ignoring it. And so both parties certainly have some answering to do when it comes to Latino voters. Now, both parties do need to come to grips with the Latino vote, understand exactly what the issues are, and really stop scapegoating immigrants as someone who's a problem with either security or the economy in the United States. It just simply isn't the case. And Latino voters appear to be very, very frustrated in the latest polling data. MARTIN: Matt Barreto is a professor of political science at the University of Washington. He's also a pollster with Latino Decisions. He was kind enough to join us from his home office in Seattle. Brian Lyman is a state capital reporter at the Montgomery Advertiser. He joined us from the newsroom in Montgomery. Thank you both so much for joining us. BARRETO: Thanks a lot.

It's a given of American politics. The president and political party able to achieve immigration reform, or at the very least appear to be trying hard to do so, are likely to gain the loyalty of voters with ties to recent-immigrant communities. Also, it's clearly not sustainable for the U.S. to have relatively poor control of its borders and an estimated 11 million illegal immigrants living in the shadows. That's the backdrop for President Obama's visit to the U.S.-Mexico border Tuesday, El Paso, Tex. specifically, to talk immigration reform. As NPR's Mara Liasson and Liz Halloran have both reported this week, the president has been talking a lot with Latinos in recent weeks. It's part of his effort to energize not just an important part of the Democratic Party's base but the nation's fastest growing ethnic group, many of whose members have been  disappointed by the administration's policies and lack of results, to date, on reform. For instance, the Obama Administration has prided itself on deportation statistics that have risen on its watch compared with the Bush Administration, especially deportations of undocumented immigrants with with criminal records. But boasting of higher deportations isn't a message likely to win over many Latinos whose families are impacted by such measures, particularly since deportations haven't only affected those with criminal backgrounds. The president also promised in the run-up to the 2010 mid-term elections that immigration reform would be high on his agenda. So promising to push legislation to that end this year is part of keeping that vow. The White House and congressional Democrats also want to take advantage of the fissures on immigration within the Republican Party. By pushing an immigration overhaul, they're banking on immigration hardliners in the Republican Party, through words and actions, doing their part to energize  Latinos in the Democratic base. It needs to be said that not all Democrats accept the idea of providing a path to legalization, so-called amnesty, for illegal immigrants. And not all Republicans are against reform. As Mara reported on Morning Edition: MARA: Republicans say they want to pass bills that would enhance border security \u2014 not legalize undocumented workers. But GOP strategist Marty Wilson thinks that's short-sighted. Wilson ran Carly Fiorina's Senate race in California, a race he says she lost  because she didn't get enough Hispanic votes. WILSON: The hardline approach on immigration, which is: \"find em, arrest 'em, and throw 'em out,\" is not going to work. Latinos are a growing population in a state like California. They're a growing political force. And unless we come up with a better way to talk about immigration, we're going to continue to way underperform and that does not indicate that you're going to win many elections. MARA: Wilson thinks Republicans should  add a guest worker program to their border-security bills. That would allow them to appear welcoming to Hispanics without angering their conservative base with talk of amnesty. Mara also points out that Obama and Democrats generally pretty much view their approach as a no-lose proposition politically. That also makes it a no-brainer. MARA: Right now, it's hard to imagine the two parties finding common ground on this issue. And its possible the president wins either way. If he can get some kind of  immigration bill passed, he'll have fulfilled his promise to Hispanic voters. If he can't, he'll be able to argue that it was the Republicans who stopped him.",

Rick Perry speaks at a campaign event at Clark Electric Co-op on Dec. 27 in Osceola, Iowa. Perry's stance on immigration has troubled some Iowa voters. Campaign buses loaded with Republican presidential hopefuls and their entourages are rolling across Iowa as the candidates hope some face time with GOP voters will help boost their chances in the Jan. 3 caucuses. The main issue for many Iowa voters is the economy. But there's a sleeper issue emerging: immigration reform. Iowa's Hispanic population is surging and Republican candidates are struggling with how best to deal with voter concerns. In Muscatine, Iowa, there's nothing exotic about the family-style restaurant \u2014 just big plates heaping with hearty food. It's open for breakfast, lunch and dinner, seven days a week. And owner Nick Filiz says everyone here seems to be listening closely to the Republican presidential candidates. \"I'm myself all considering but ... I haven't made [up] my mind,\" says Filiz. He says that many of his customers, too, tell him they have yet to settle on a choice. \"With politicians, there's always a lot of promise. That's a very obvious thing.  But who will get the job done. That is the main question,\" he says. Filiz immigrated from Turkey, legally, more than 30 years ago and he says the issue of immigration reform is a big one in this part of eastern Iowa. Statewide, the Hispanic population has almost doubled over the last decade and is now up to 5 percent overall. That growth is concentrated in some towns and counties where Mexican and Central American immigrants fill jobs in meat-packing and poultry plants, factories and farming. In Muscatine county, the Hispanic population is now 16 percent and growing. And for some employers such as Filiz, the lack of any immigration policy reform in Washington is frustrating. \"In the restaurant business especially, you know, you get a lot of undocumented aliens,\" Filiz says. \"I'd like to see that be solved the right way, you know?\" Filiz is a registered independent who says he will vote in the Jan. 3 Republican caucus. He favors a path to citizenship for some illegal immigrants, similar to what was done under President Reagan in the 1980s. But among Republicans in Iowa, that position is the exception and not the rule. \"I think that people that aren't legal here need to be sent back,\"  says Miles Reiner, a 33-year-old fork lift driver from Muscatine, who's undecided about who he'll vote for. To Reiner, immigration is an important issue. His feelings are echoed by retiree Bob Lamb. \"Yeah, they should deport 'em if they don't come in legally,\" Lamb says. \"They take our... they get unemployment, they get welfare, and they pay nothing and they just keep givin' to 'em. That's the way I feel about it.\" The federal raid of a meat-packing plant in Postville, Iowa in 2008 \u2014 the country's biggest such raid to date \u2014 has heightened awareness of the illegal immigration issue here. So many GOP voters have a hard time with positions such as former House Speaker Newt Gingrich's, who called for a path to legalized status for some illegal immigrants in a debate in November. \"If you've been here 25 years and you've got three kids and two grandkids, you've been paying taxes and obeying the law, you belong to a local church, I don't think we're going to separate you from your family, uproot you forcefully and kick you out,\" Gingrich said then. Also not sitting well with some Iowa voters is Texas Gov. Rick Perry's defense, in another debate, of his support of in-state tuition rates for the children of illegal immigrants. \"But if you say that we should not educate children who have come into our state for no other reason than they've been brought there, I don't think you have a heart,\" Perry said at the time. \"And conservatives really didn't like that,\" says University of Iowa political science professor Tim Hagle, who explains that Republicans don't like being called heartless by one of their own. Nevertheless, he says most Republicans in Iowa don't like any policy that could seem to reward illegal behavior. But he also notes that hard-line stances, such as that taken by Rep. Michele Bachmann, haven't really helped presidential hopefuls. \"Candidates can probably get by with fairly unspecific \u2014 not to say vague, but just unspecific \u2014 saying something along the lines of, 'we need to secure the border,'\" Hagle says. In other words, Hagle says, the right position on immigration won't likely win a candidate Iowa, but the wrong position could certainly hurt.",

The Republican presidential debates have mattered more this year than anything else in determining which candidate had the momentum and the lead in the race for the White House nomination. Thus, Thursday evening's Sioux City, Iowa debate (Fox News, 9 pm ET) could be decisive in narrowing the gap between Newt Gingrich and the rest of the field or cementing his frontrunner status. The debate is the last one before the Jan. 3 Iowa caucuses so the pressure will be intense on the candidates to leave the most positive impression possible on Iowans as voters' attention will soon turn to their last-minute preparations for the holidays. For Gingrich, that means continuing his string of strong debate performances. With the rhetorical ability to \"float like a butterfly and sting like a bee\" to use  Muhammad Ali's old line, Gingrich has shown the ability to sidestep potentially dangerous debate moments. For instance, during the Des Moines debate, Rep. Ron Paul of Texas attacked the former speaker for taking money in his post-Congress years from mortgage giant Freddie Mac. Gingrich responded by saying he agreed with Paul that the Federal Reserve caused the 2007-2008 economic crisis. It was part of Gingrich's strategy to not go negative, which he has mostly kept to as he tries to remake his 1990s reputation as a politician with an unseemly appetite for the bloodsport aspect of modern political combat. Given his stated intention, we can expect Gingrich to try to stay above the fray. Mitt Romney will likely try to make it difficult for Gingrich to do that. The former Massachusetts governor has been going negative on Gingrich, using the word \"zany\" in a New York Times interview Wednesday to make the point that whoever GOP voters choose as their White House nominee will need to have \"sobriety.\" He didn't say Gingrich was unstable, of course; he only implied it. Romney's obvious point: he, not Gingrich, had the stability to have codes to the nation's nuclear arsenal at his disposal. But while Romney will be trying to get under Gingrich's skin to get the former speaker to stumble, he'll need to be on guard for Gingrich and others doing the same to him. Texas Gov. Rick Perry especially has seemed to have great success pushing Romney's buttons, getting him to make some of the most memorable gaffes of the debates. The most recent happened in Des Moines just days ago when Romney made his ill advised $10,000 bet offer in an attempt to out maneuver Perry on a point about Romney's stand on the individual healthcare insurance mandate. And at an earlier debate, it was Perry who attacked Romney for having hired a lawncare service which repeatedly used illegal immigrants on Romney's property, causing Romney to say that he eventually told the contractor to not bring the undocumented workers because \"I'm running for office, for Pete's sakes.\" The other problem for Romney, of course, is that attacking Gingrich at the debate won't do much to help Romney with his likeability problem and may even worsen it with some Iowa voters. Paul, who has been making a strong showing in Iowa polls, in the top three in a number of them, will likely help Romney make the anti-Gingrich case. Paul seems to have a visceral dislike for Gingrich. He was first out with the harshest ads against Gingrich, famously accusing him in one of \"serial hypocrisy.\" There's no reason to expect he would relent Thursday evening. Three of the four remaining candidates \u2014 Perry, Rep. Michele Bachmann of Minnesota and Rick Santorum, the former U.S. senator from Pennsylvania, have each made major plays for the caucus votes of social conservatives in Iowa. They appear to be splitting that vote. So you'd expect each of them to aim their appeals Thursday evening at trying to consolidate that voting bloc behind his or her candidacy while continuing their argument that neither Gingrich or Romney is truly conservative enough to be the Republican standard bearer. Indeed, Bachmann made that argument at the recent Des Moines debate, creating a hybrid candidate she was running against she called \"Newt Romney.\" But that wasn't enough to change the shape of the race. Jon Huntsman Jr., the former Utah governor, wrote off Iowa some time ago. So his appeal will directed less at Iowans than New Hampsherites since he hopes to have a strong enough showing in the Granite State to get Republican voters to reconsider his candidacy. It's a long shot strategy but he doesn't have many other options at this point. Update 5:10 p.m. We'll be following the debate highlights Thursday night on Twitter at @nprpolitics.

Since then, the candidates have gotten tougher on each other. Once upon a time, the Republican presidential contenders seemed to be mostly on the same page. They agreed on who the real enemies were \u2014 as Newt Gingrich explained at a debate in September. \"All of my friends up here are going to repudiate every effort of the news media to get Republicans to fight each other to protect Barack Obama, who deserves to be defeated,\" he said. \"And all of us are committed as a team \u2014 whoever the nominee is, we are all for defeating Barack Obama.\" Well, that team seems to have broken up. In the past few days, the contenders have shown themselves to be ready, willing and able to fight each other. Taking Aim After Michele Bachmann, Rick Perry and Herman Cain all took a turn at being the major conservative challenger to Mitt Romney, now it's Gingrich who's at \u2014 or near \u2014 the top of most of the polls. So on Wednesday, Ron Paul welcomed Gingrich to the big time with a video that questions whether he stands for anything but his wallet. Gingrich has said he won't hit back  at his rivals. Drawing \"contrasts,\" however, seems to be okay, especially when it comes to his chief rival, Romney. There was no scary music or fancy editing \u2014 just his phone call a couple of days ago to a South Carolina radio station. \"I don't claim to be the perfect candidate,\" Gingrich said. \"I just claim to be a lot more conservative than Mitt Romney and a lot more electable than anybody else.\" More than any of the candidates, Romney has remained above the fray, saving his criticisms for Obama, as if he were already the GOP nominee. But most Republican voters remain unconvinced. Romney's percentage of support has generally been stuck in the high teens to low 20s. And now, he feels Gingrich breathing down his neck \u2014 or is it the other way around? On Fox News, Romney went on the attack, calling Gingrich \"a lifelong politician.\" \"I think you have to have the credibility of understanding how the economy works,\" Romney continued. \"And I do. And that's one reason I'm in this race.\" Romney also slammed Gingrich for saying that illegal immigrants who had been in this country for a long time, put down roots and raised a family shouldn't automatically be deported. \"If he's going to do what I believe he's said he was going to do for those people who would be allowed to stay permanently and become citizens, that would be providing for them a form of amnesty,\" Romney said, knowing that would be anathema to most conservative voters. 'Tis The Season ... For Attacking \"It's time for him to show some teeth,\" says Republican political analyst Ed Rogers. It's getting to be time to get undecideds to make a decision. It's getting to be time to build up yourself and diminish your opponents. Ed Rogers, Republican political analyst He says Romney has to protect his position as a leading candidate. \"And it's time for him to make sure that nobody builds up a head of steam where he really gets behind and has to become so harshly negative that it reflects poorly on him,\" Rogers adds. Actually, says Rogers, 'tis the season for all the candidates to show some teeth. \"We're only five weeks away from the Iowa caucuses. ... So it's getting to be time to get undecideds to make a decision,\" he says. \"It's getting to be time to build up yourself and diminish your opponents.\" Perry was blunt about his intention to do just that. On Wednesday, he said on Fox & Friends that Americans are looking for an outsider to clean up Washington and that Gingrich and Romney are insiders. \"And we're going to be talking about that and we're going to be talking about it in harsh and strong terms over the course of the next four to five weeks as we get ready for those New Hampshire caucuses,\" Perry said. Actually, it's the New Hampshire primary. Iowa's the state with the caucuses. But no doubt one of Perry's rivals will be glad to point out his mistake.",

            "article_content": "Republican presidential contender Mitt Romney campaigned in Florida Tuesday  \u2014 and picked up a few endorsements from Cuban-American lawmakers.  GUY RAZ, HOST: Mitt Romney headed South today as well. In Florida, he campaigned and picked up a few endorsements. His new supporters include some prominent Cuban-American members of Congress - Ileana Ros-Lehtinen, Mario Diaz-Balart - and former congressman Lincoln Diaz-Balart. NPR's Ari Shapiro reports from Miami on Mitt Romney's efforts to win over a key segment of the Florida vote. ARI SHAPIRO, BYLINE: Florida Republicans are as diverse as the state. There are evangelical mega-churches around Orlando; transplanted Northeasterners at the tip of the state; and in the Panhandle, conservative voters have more in common with Alabama than with Miami. This morning, it was obvious which section of the diverse Republican Party Mitt Romney was trying to appeal to. MITT ROMNEY: You probably didn't know that my dad was not born in this country. He was born in Mexico. SHAPIRO: In Florida, Latino voters could determine the winner, both in the primary and later, in the general election. Today, Romney did his utmost to win them over. He even brought along his son, Craig. MITT ROMNEY: He took a couple of years of Spanish in high school, so his Spanish wouldn't be terribly good. But he also lived in Chile for a couple of years. So I'm going to ask you if you'll - can you still speak a little Spanish? I never speak in Spanish, so just say hello. (SOUNDBITE OF APPALUSE) SHAPIRO: Craig Romney then gave a 10-second hello in Spanish. CRAIG ROMNEY: Thank you. (Foreign language spoken) SHAPIRO: ...and then switched back to English. The Romney campaign billed this event as a discussion about the economy, but the 10-minute appearance did not include a back-and-forth with the audience. That may be just as well. Immigration is important in this community, and Romney's position on the issue is complicated - his opponents say contradictory. Last week, Romney said any plan that would legalize a large section of undocumented workers amounts to amnesty. Even congresswoman Ileana Ros-Lehtinen, who endorsed Romney today, said they don't see eye-to-eye. REP. ILEANA ROS-LEHTINEN: Yes, I disagree with him on many issues. He disagrees with me on many issues. But you balance it out and you say, what is important to me right now? And it's the economy and creating jobs for this generation and the next ones. SHAPIRO: Romney delivered a version of his typical stump speech in front of a few dozen people. Behind him, pallets stacked to the ceiling with guava bites, coconut water, sofrito, and other products from Latin America. This is Conchita Foods. The company has been in Rita Farrow's family almost 60 years. RITA FARROW: Ooh, since Cuba. My father-in-law was the one that founded the company. And then the Cuban government took it over, like they took everything over. And we came over here, and we started it here again. And here we are. SHAPIRO: That experience gives her an innate distrust of big government, which is one reason she loves Mitt Romney. And Romney argued that it's a reason the voters of south Florida should reject Barack Obama. MITT ROMNEY: He believes that government has the answers to all the challenges; that government can do a better job guiding our economy than can free people; that government can tell us how to live our lives better than can free people. He's wrong. SHAPIRO: The Democrats have not waited to hit back. Yesterday, the DNC released an attack ad that charts Romney's changing positions on abortion, health care and other issues. In the scrum of reporters after the speech today, Romney responded. MITT ROMNEY: It shows that they're awfully afraid of facing me in the general election. They want to throw the primary process to anybody but me. So bring it on; we're ready for them. SHAPIRO: Romney took second place to John McCain here four years ago. He's been working hard to make sure that doesn't happen again. But Florida International University political scientist Dario Moreno says that's a double-edged sword. DARIO MORENO: He is the establishment candidate at a time when a lot of voters - Republicans as well as Democrats - are upset at the political establishment. SHAPIRO: Florida voters go to the polls at the end of January. Ari Shapiro, NPR News, Miami. Copyright \u00a9 2011 NPR.  All rights reserved.

Mitt Romney said that sounds like amnesty. \"Saying that we're all going to say to the people who've come here illegally that now you're all going to get to stay, or some large number are going to get to stay and become permanent residents of the United States, that will only encourage more people to do the same thing,\" Romney said. The next day, Gingrich tweeted a link to an earlier Romney appearance, from NBC's Meet the Press in 2007. \"Those people who've come here illegally and are in this country, the 12 million or so who are here illegally, should be able to sign up for permanent residency or citizenship,\" Romney said at the time. The Romney campaign says that quote was taken out of context. They point to what Romney said next:  \"But they should not be given a special pathway, a special guarantee that all of them get to stay here for the rest of their lives merely by virtue of having come here illegally.\" So Romney gives a thumbs up on some form of legal status. And he gives a thumbs down on what he calls \"a special pathway\" or \"a special guarantee.\" Romney went on to say that he believes people in the U.S. illegally who want citizenship should have to leave the country first. \"There's a set period whereupon they should return home, and if they've been approved for citizenship or for permanent residency ... that'd be a different matter. But for a great majority, they'll be going home,\" Romney said in the 2007 Meet the Press interview. Gov. Romney believes that illegal immigrants who apply for legal status should not be given any advantage over those who are following the law and waiting their turn. Lanhee Chen, Romney policy director But this week, Bloomberg News released an even older quote from Romney that seems to conflict with that statement. In 2006, Romney told Bloomberg reporters and editors that undocumented workers \"are not going to be rounded up and box-carred out.\" \"We need to begin a process of registering those people, some being returned and some beginning the process of applying for citizenship and establishing legal status,\" he said at the time, according to Bloomberg. This plays into a larger criticism of Romney as flip-flopper that Democrats and Republicans alike have capitalized on. What Does He Mean? Romney policy director Lanhee Chen argues that there is nothing inconsistent in Romney's statements on immigration. In a statement to NPR, Chen said, \"Gov. Romney believes that illegal immigrants who apply for legal status should not be given any advantage over those who are following the law and waiting their turn.\" But even some Republican experts in this field say Romney has not been clear. \"It's still very confusing as to what he's proposing and what some of the solutions are that some of the other Republican candidates would be offering,\" says Hector Barajas, a Republican political consultant in California who specializes in Latino issues. Barajas says the murkiness around immigration should not surprise anyone. Republican candidates are trying to appeal to many different constituencies \u2014 anti-immigration hard-liners, Latino swing voters, small business owners who depend on foreign labor and more \u2014 all without alienating anyone. A candidate who goes too far in one direction risks alienating Tea Party voters. But go too far in the other direction, and they risk alienating the fastest-growing minority group in the country. \"It's kind of like having that Thanksgiving dinner where you invite everyone in the family and try to figure out and make sure Uncle Joe's happy along with Aunt Suzy,\" says Barajas. \"You're trying as much as possible, and a lot of these presidential candidates are trying as much as possible to appease every section of the base,\" On Tuesday, Romney will be campaigning in the early voting state of Florida, where immigration is a huge issue. And with Florida's large Latino population, his answers to these questions could ultimately determine whether he wins the state or takes runner-up, as he did to John McCain four years ago.",

Gingrich, who has been moving up in the polls, broke with his fellow candidates by saying that some illegal immigrants should be allowed to stay in the United States. Though his statements were in line with other GOP candidates from years past, the aftershocks show just how narrow the immigration debate has been in recent years. At first, Gingrich spouted the typical Tea Party-era Republican line: \"If you've come here recently you have no ties to this country, you oughta go home, period,\" he said before an audience in Washington, D.C. But his next statement was what raised eyebrows. \"If you've been here 25 years, and you got three kids and two grandkids, you've been paying taxes and obeying the law, you belong to a local church, I don't think were gonna separate you from your family, uproot you forcefully, and kick you out,\" Gingrich said. That got a lot of pushback from Gingrich's fellow candidates, and a lot of post-debate attention. But his statement is not radical by traditional Republican standards. \"This is a position that's consistent with what an important element in the Republican Party has believed and argued for, for a long time,\" says Doris Meissner, a senior fellow with the bipartisan Migration Policy Institute in Washington, D.C., and head of the Immigration and Naturalization Service under President Clinton. Meissner says up until the past few years, Gingrich's was the mainstream view held \"by centrists, by people who have represented business and employers, and more internationally oriented views within the Republican Party.\" Meissner is describing people like President George W. Bush and Arizona Sen. John McCain \u2014 both of whom pushed legislation to legalize some illegal immigrants and create a guest-worker program.  That effort failed as Republicans became focused on border security.  That led to enforcement-only legislation in Congress and Republican-led state laws intended to crack down on illegal immigration in states like Arizona and Alabama. Candidate Mitt Romney sounded that note Tuesday night. \"To [say] that we're gonna say to the people who've come here illegally that now you're all gonna get to stay or some large number are gonna get to stay and become permanent residents of the United States, that will only encourage more people to do the same thing,\" Romney said. That argument is based on what happened after Ronald Reagan granted amnesty to 3 million illegal immigrants in 1986, a move Gingrich supported while in Congress.  Since then, many more people have come to the U.S. illegally. But in the past decade, the U.S. also built some 700 miles of fencing, added roughly 20,000 Border Patrol agents and put in place drones, sensors and other technology.  Fewer people are crossing the border illegally. And the Obama administration is deporting record numbers of people already here.  With those facts in mind,  Gingrich seems to be taking a calculated step, talking not just about guns and fences, but about families. \"As somebody who believes strongly in family, you're going to have a hard time explaining why that particular subset is being broken up and forced to leave given the fact that they've been law-abiding citizens for the last 25 years,\" Gingrich said at the debate. Gingrich was not pressed on the specifics of his proposal.  But Meissner says, regardless, his remarks are shrewd politically. \"The Republican Party in its very harsh and unyielding recent stance on illegal immigration has alienated itself from the single-largest bloc of voters that are in play in the future in our political system, and that is Latino, Hispanic voters.\" At the very least, Gingrich is differentiating himself from his fellow Republican candidates.  And he may help his party in the long run, if not himself, by broadening the immigration issue after several years of narrowing.",

            "article_content": "Most of the Republican presidential debates in this election cycle have taken place in a swing state, and focused on the economy. Tuesday night's gathering was different. CNN and two conservative think thanks sponsored the eleventh debate of the year in Washington, D.C.  LINDA WERTHEIMER, HOST: This is MORNING EDITION from NPR News. I'm Linda Wertheimer. STEVE INSKEEP, HOST: And I'm Steve Inskeep, good morning. The new man at the top of some Republican presidential polls is Newt Gingrich. He's the latest of many candidates to emerge as an alternative to Mitt Romney in the race for the nomination. And Gingrich took some bold positions in last night's presidential debate. CNN and two conservative think-tanks sponsored a talk in Washington on foreign policy, and NPR's Ari Shapiro was there. ARI SHAPIRO, BYLINE: The eight rivals took the stage at Constitution Hall, just a few blocks from the White House that they hope to move into a little more than a year from now. The two-hour exchange did not have the sharp personal attacks or spectacular flameouts that have made some of the other debates into viral YouTube sensations. But there were strong differences of opinion, showing how little unity there is in the Republican Party today on issues of national security. On immigration, former House speaker Newt Gingrich broke with traditional Republican orthodoxy. He said he would allow some undocumented immigrants to stay in the U.S. legally. NEWT GINGRICH: I don't see how the party that says it's the party of the family is going to adopt an immigration policy which destroys families that have been here for a quarter century. SHAPIRO: Former Massachusetts Governor Mitt Romney called Gingrich's plan amnesty, adding that it will be a magnet attracting still more people across the border. MITT ROMNEY: There's no question but that saying that were going to say to the people who've come here illegally, that now you're all going to get to stay. Or some large number are going to get to stay and become permanent residents of the United States. That will only encourage more people to do the same thing. SHAPIRO: This Romney-Gingrich clash was a moment that many people were looking for. Romney has more or less led the Republican pack from the beginning of the race. Gingrich, rising from single digits in earlier phases of the campaign, pulled ahead of Romney for the first time this week. But Gingrich did not play it safe last night. On top of his immigration stance, he broke with his party's doctrine when a member of the audience asked the candidates to rule out military spending cuts to help reduce the federal deficit. Gingrich refused to do so. GINGRICH: It's clear, if it takes 15 to 20 years to build a weapons system at a time when Apple changes technology every nine months, there's something profoundly wrong with the system. So I'm not going to tell you automatically I'm going to say yes. (SOUNDBITE OF APPLAUSE) SHAPIRO: That, too, differs from Romney. There were also disagreements over aid to Pakistan. Texas Governor Rick Perry believes the country should get no U.S. money. GOVERNOR RICK PERRY: Until Pakistan clearly shows that they have America's best interest in mind, I would not send them one penny. Period. SHAPIRO: Minnesota Congresswoman Michelle Bachmann called Perry highly naive. She argued that the U.S. cannot afford to give up the intelligence that it gets for the money paid to Pakistan. REPRESENTATIVE MICHELE BACHMANN: Pakistan is a nation that it's kind of like too nuclear to fail. SHAPIRO: In one of the most pointed exchanges of the evening, former Utah Governor John Huntsman supported bringing troops home from Afghanistan, prompting Romney to accuse him of cut-and-run. ROMNEY: Are you suggesting, governor, that we take all the troops out next week? What's your proposal? JON HUNTSMAN: Did you hear what I just said? I said we should draw down from 100,000. We don't need 100,000 troops. SHAPIRO: Romney said he would defer to the generals, which prompted this from Huntsman. HUNTSMAN: At the end of the day, the president of the United States is commander-in-chief. Commander-in-chief. Of course you're going to listen to the generals. (SOUNDBITE OF APPLAUSE) HUNTSMAN: But I remember when we listened to the generals in 1967 and we heard a certain course in Southeast Asia that didn't serve our interests very well. SHAPIRO: When the subject turned to the war on terror, Texas Congressman Ron Paul said it wasn't worth compromising civil liberties. But most of the candidates took a hawkish position. Former Pennsylvania Senator Rick Santorum said he would support profiling people, including Muslims. When former Godfather's Pizza CEO Herman Cain took a similar position, moderator Wolf Blitzer of CNN pushed for specifics. WOLF BLITZER: Is it OK for Muslim Americans to get more intensive pat downs or security when they go through airports than Christian Americans or Jewish Americans? HERMAN CAIN: No Blitz, that's oversimplifying it. SHAPIRO: Cain then apologized and said he meant that this is a blitz debate. There was little discussion of China or Iraq, and no mention, at all, of the debt crisis in Europe. But there are many more debates just around the corner. Ari Shapiro, NPR News, Washington.

            "article_content": "Mitt Romney, Herman Cain and Newt Gingrich before a GOP presidential debate in Washington, Tuesday, Nov. 22, 2011. \n                \n                    \n                    Evan Vucci/AP\n                    \n                \nhide caption Mitt Romney, Herman Cain and Newt Gingrich before a GOP presidential debate in Washington, Tuesday, Nov. 22, 2011. The big theme out of Tuesday night's Republican presidential debate in Washington was Newt Gingrich's compassionate stance toward illegal immigrants who have put down deep roots in the U.S. That position by Gingrich, who has recently surged to join Mitt Romney at the head of the Republican field according to recent polls, conflicted with the more hardline views of many conservative voters. Many of those GOP voters who will decide their party's nominee oppose allowing illegal immigrants to remain in the U.S., period. The immediate question for Gingrich was, after boldly defending his position that undocumented immigrants who've lived in the U.S. for many years, establishing families and belonging to churches, should be allowed to remain in the U.S., would Gingrich now suffer the same fate as Texas Gov. Rick Perry. While a number of Perry stumbles led to his fall from the front to rear of the GOP pack, the start of his decline was his defense of his relatively moderate immigration position. Romney's attacks on the Texas governor's support for in-state tuition for undocumented immigrants, for instance, helped to stop Perry's initial momentum and the former frontrunner has never recovered. As aware as Gingrich was of this recent history, the former House speaker didn't retreat even when Romney said Gingrich's position amounted to a \"magnet\" while another rival, Rep. Michele Bachmann of Minnesota, referred to it as an amnesty. Gingrich said: \"If you've been here 25 years and you got three kids and two grandkids, you've been paying taxes and obeying the law, you belong to a local church, I don't think we're going to separate you from your family, uproot you forcefully and kick you out.\" As he did weeks ago to Perry for a moderate immigration stance, Romney went after Gingrich. Romney said: \"There's \u2014 there's no question.  But to \u2014 saying that we're going to say to the people who've come here illegally that now you're all going to get to stay, or some large number are going to get to stay and become permanent residents of the United States, that will only encourage more people to do the same thing.  People respond to incentives.  And if you could become a permanent resident of the United States by coming here illegally, you'll do so.  What I want to do is bring people into this country legally, particularly those that have education and skill that allows us to compete globally. \" It remains to be seen if Romney's attacks and the antipathy of many conservatives to \"amnesty\" spell doom for Gingrich's bid as they seemed to for Perry. Gingrich may be able to better weather the coming storm because he possesses vastly superior rhetorical skills than Perry. In terms of the overall shape of the race, the debate did little to knock Romney from his perch as the likely nominee. Even though there was some Romney weirdness during the opening introductions when the former Massachusetts governor said Mitt was his real first name when it's actually Willard, that didn't seem like a big enough gaffe to derail him. . Aside from that, however, Romney, as usual, cruised comfortably through the debate, rattling off facts with aplomb and still seeming like the candidate who could best measure up on the same stage against President Obama. Jon Huntsman had one of his better debates, no doubt because the topics of foreign policy and national security played to his strength as a former U.S. ambassador to China. Rep. Ron Paul of Texas again provided some of the most memorable moments of a presidential debate by offering the usual libertarian contrasts to the GOP orthodoxy, opposing U.S. troops in Iraq and the Patriot Act for instance as his rivals looked on with amusement or exasperation. Herman Cain, the former pizza company CEO, and former frontrunner did nothing to redeem himself following his painful flub of the Libya question when he met with journalists last week in Milwaukee. Bachmann beat Perry when the debate turned to Pakistan which wasn't hard since Perry seemed tentative and Bachmann well briefed, as one might expect for a member of the House Intelligence Committee. But it amounted to kicking a man when he was down, a performance unlikely to resurrect her candidacy. Meanwhile, Rick Santorum, the former U.S. senator from Pennsylvania was left still looking for his breakout. Others were left wondering just how much longer he would hang in the race. The debate, shown on CNN and held at the historic DAR Constitution Hall, was sponsored by the conservative think tanks the American Enterprise Institute and the Heritage Foundation. That fact led to a procession of George W. Bush era neocons in the audience who posed questions to the candidates. They included Paul Wolfowitz, who served as a top Defense Department official when Donald Rumsfeld was Defense Secretary and David Addington who was chief of staff to Vice President Dick Cheney. The night began with even more of a blast-from-the-past than that. Ed Meese, who served as President Ronald Reagan's attorney general, got to throw out the first question.",

            "article_content": "Barack Obama won Nevada when he won the presidency in 2008. So did George W. Bush before Obama and Bill Clinton before Bush. Nevada is a swing state \u2014 and when Democrats win it, it's with the strong support of Latinos who account for 17 percent of the state's voters. But recent polls have shown that while most Latinos still support the president's re-election, that support is waning. Republicans in Las Vegas see an opening, but it's one that they are finding hard to exploit. Mixed Views On Obama In the parking lot of the Mariana's Supermarket on the east side of Las Vegas, most of the shoppers speak Spanish. Mariana's is a local chain, founded by Mexican immigrants a couple of decades ago. It bills itself as the Hispanic supermarket for Las Vegas. It's in a working-class neighborhood where Obama did very well with Latino voters in 2008.  Mariana's bills itself as the Hispanic supermarket for Las Vegas. It's in a working-class neighborhood where President Obama did well with Latino voters in 2008. Most of them still support him.  Mariana's bills itself as the Hispanic supermarket for Las Vegas. It's in a working-class neighborhood where President Obama did well with Latino voters in 2008. Most of them still support him. According to the polls, most of them supported Obama then and support him now. \"I think he's doing a good job,\" Manuel Ruedo, a bagger at Mariana's, tells NPR's Robert Siegel. \"The way I see it, it's not like he can go there and do whatever he wants, right?\" But some who voted for Obama last time, like Sandy Chan, say they won't vote for him again. \"Oh, he made a lot of promises and he didn't accomplish them,\" she says as she loads her shopping bags and young daughter into an SUV. \"That's how we think about him. The economy was going to go up. A lot of Hispanic people were going to be able to get a job. But that didn't happen.\" And some are undecided, like Richard Munoz, a shopping center security guard who moved here from California where he used to be a cook. He says he regrets his vote in 2008.  The president of the local Culinary Workers Union Geoconde Arguello-Kline says Nevada Latinos will come around and support Obama. \"I voted for the wrong guy; he's in office. If he can maybe do something different \u2014 show that he's willing to change the economy, I mean, instead of stuff that's going on overseas,\" he says, referring to Obama sending military advisers to Uganda. \"What are we benefitting from that?\" Union President Says Latinos Will Come Around It's not as if Obama and the Democrats have no cards to play for Latino votes in Nevada. Most Latinos here are working class. More are registered Democrats than Republicans. Latinos account for almost half of the 55,000 member Culinary Workers Union. They work at the hotels and casinos that are the heart of the economy of southern Nevada. The president of the local Culinary Workers Union, Nicaraguan-born Geoconde Arguello-Kline, endorsed Obama early in the 2008 cycle. She and the union are still very much with him. As for that notable loss of enthusiasm among Nevada Latinos, she says they'll come around. View larger map \"The people, they have to see the facts. And the facts [are], the country went through a lot before we had President Barack Obama,\" Arguello-Kline says. \"We already had a big, tough situation where we knew were going to go through a recession. We can't blame one person about what's been happening for many, many years, because that was a crutch. \"You know, the economy is not back yet. But at the same time, people realize inside them, when you heard about attacking the middle class? Whoa, what's this?\" By attacks on the middle class, Arguello-Kline means cuts that are affecting firefighters and school teachers. She says Republican support of such cuts will alienate her union membership. NPR sat down with conservative Latinos active in Republican politics to talk about their community and their party. While they spoke of strong connections over abortion, over the failure to get unemployment down, immigration figured on everyone's mind. Local Republicans Frustrated Latinos' palpable disappointment with the administration over unemployment that is still more than 13 percent in this state, over the worst foreclosure rate in the country, and over the lack of immigration reform has energized local Republicans. But it also has them frustrated. When the Republican presidential candidates debated in Las Vegas last week at the Western Republican Leadership Conference, local businessman Robert Zavala asked: \"We have 50 million Latinos and not all of us are illegal. What is the message from you guys to our Latino community?\" The conservative group Crossroads GPS made a Spanish-language commercial to resonate with Latinos. In it, a woman rises from a troubled sleep. She's a single mother of two. It's just past 3 a.m., the time it was in Hillary Clinton's 2008 commercial questioning Obama's readiness to handle a crisis. But now, what's troubling the Latina is the economy. The answers included Newt Gingrich's promise of a growing economy, Ron Paul's plea to not think about people in groups, and Rick Santorum's appeal to values of faith and family. Rick Perry defended the 14th Amendment's grant of citizenship to babies born here, despite their parents' status, while Michele Bachmann called for legislation governing so-called anchor babies. Before the debate was done, Mitt Romney charged Perry with creating many new jobs in Texas for illegal immigrants and rebutted Perry's charge that he had hired illegal immigrants in Massachusetts. A few days later, Zavala says he was frustrated with the debate. \"I'm still waiting for the answer,\" he says. \"Our party has not realized how to reach the Latino community. That message doesn't exist.\" But if Latinos are turned off enough by the Democrats and stay home, that alone could bring the state back into the red column. James Campos, who worked on Sen. John McCain's campaign in Las  Vegas, figures the Republicans need 40 percent of the Latino vote in Nevada to win this state's valuable five electoral votes next November.",

            "article_content": " Former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney (left) and Texas Gov. Rick Perry got into a heated exchange about immigration during Tuesday's GOP presidential debate in Las Vegas. Mitt Romney has been at or near the top of most polls since the presidential campaign began. But he's generally had company in the top tier. For a while last summer, it looked like  Minnesota Rep. Michele Bachmann was a contender. Then Texas Gov. Rick Perry  announced he  was running and shot to the head of the pack. Right now, it's businessman Herman Cain who is Romney's chief rival. At the Western Republican Leadership Conference (WRLC) in Las Vegas, about 600  die-hard Republicans were considering their options.  Mitt Romney  may be  the presumed front-runner, but most here mentioned his name as just one possibility on their short list of interesting candidates.   Sometimes Romney didn't even make the list. Chuck Muth said he was a \"Newt, Cain, Perry, Ron Paul\" kind of guy.  He heads a Las Vegas conservative organization called Citizen Outreach. Many of the conservatives who make up the bulk of Republican primary voters just don't feel that Romney is one   of them, says Muth. \"If Romney is the nominee, we'll be there for him,\" Muth says. \"But if we can possibly have somebody who's a stronger conservative, we'd rather have that.\" Right now,  the candidate who's  leading that category is Herman Cain. When he addressed some of the conference attendees, he was greeted with cheers. His performance was vintage Cain: optimistic and plain-spoken. For example, he said that \"stupid people are ruining America.\" But \"the good news\" \u2014 Cain usually has some good news \u2014 \"is we can outvote them. We can!\" The role of chief Romney alternative was previously filled by Perry  until some bad debate performances eroded his support.  At the CNN debate Tuesday night that kicked off the conference, Perry was clearly trying to regain his former position by aggressively attacking Romney, calling him a hypocrite and shouting him down when he tried to respond. The next day, WRLC attendees mulled over Perry's performance at a cocktail reception in The Garden of the Gods at Caesars Palace. The very name of the place invited them to mull over the flaws of the mortal candidates who were vying to win their support. In the case of Perry, most of the reactions to his debate performance could be summarized as, \"Yikes, what was that?\" \"Perry just totally dug his own grave,\" says Nick Pitson of Salt Lake City. \"I felt like his demeanor at the debate was kind of petty and cheap. \" Pitney's favorites are Romney and Herman Cain. And it's not just Cain's famous 9-9-9 tax plan that appeals to conservatives. Wendy Bidwell of Baltimore compares Cain's appeal for Republicans  to Barack Obama's appeal for Democrats four years ago. \"He definitely is extremely likable,\" Bidwell says. \"He has a lot of charisma, he really makes you feel that he's going to  do everything he can to do what he says he's going to do.\" And  Terry Turner of Salt Lake City says Cain's lack of political  experience is a plus. \"His business experience and his lack of political experience is in a way intriguing,\" Turner says. \"Because he doesn't have a lot of political baggage such as Mitt Romney.\" In other words, it's hard to go after Cain  on his record. He has no health care plan  to defend like Romney does. He hasn't backed in-state tuition for undocumented college students like Perry has. But Cain  does tend to shoot from the hip. And at the very moment that some of these conservatives were  singing his praises, Cain was on CNN seeming to stake out a position on abortion that might have surprised them. Cain told Piers Morgan on Wednesday that \"it ultimately gets down to a choice that that family or that mother has to make. Not me as president, not some politician, not a bureaucrat ... And whatever they decide, they decide.\"  Then again, Cain said in the same interview that he opposed abortion under any circumstances and in a statement he put out the following day he affirmed he was 100 percent pro-life.  So conservatives  may be hunting for their ideal candidate for a while.  At least until the time comes when they just want to figure out which one has the best chance of defeating Barack Obama.",

Rick Perry spoke during what became a heated Republican presidential debate Tuesday night in Las Vegas.  Herman Cain (left) watched as former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney (center) and Texas Gov. Rick Perry spoke during what became a heated Republican presidential debate Tuesday night in Las Vegas. In Las Vegas, Tuesday night's Republican presidential debate was arguably the hottest show on the Strip. It was supposed to be a test for businessman Herman Cain, who has gone from nowheresville to competing for the title of front-runner. But Texas Gov. Rick Perry, whose debates and poll numbers have been lackluster, showed a combative side that had been missing up until now. Cain, the former Godfather's Pizza executive, has become known for his down-to-earth eloquence and just one single policy proposal: the 9-9-9 plan. That's the percentage of tax he wants Americans to pay on personal income, corporate profits and purchases. Now that Cain is virtually tied for first with former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney in the latest poll, just about every other candidate on stage took a turn explaining why they think 9-9-9 is really a big zero. \"If we give Congress a 9 percent sales tax, how long will it take a liberal president and a liberal Congress to run that up to maybe 90 percent? Who knows?\" said Minnesota Rep. Michele Bachmann. Former Pennsylvania Sen. Rick Santorum weighed in: \"Herman's well-meaning, and I love his boldness and it's great, but the fact of the matter is, reports are now out that 84 percent of Americans would pay more taxes under his plan.\" Cain didn't argue for his plan so much as repeat it \u2014 and tell everyone they were wrong. \"I invite every American to do their own math, because most of these are knee-jerk reactions,\" he said. But Perry wasn't buying it. \"Herman, I love you brother, but let me tell you something \u2014 you don't have to have a big analysis to figure this thing out,\" the Texas governor said. \"Go to New Hampshire and they don't have a sales tax and you're figuring to give them one. They're not interested in 9-9-9.\" For the first time in the campaign, Perry looked like he was glad to be on the debate platform, ready to mix it up with his competitors. He seemed to be enjoying himself, especially when he was going after Romney, accusing him, for example, of hiring illegal immigrants as gardeners. \"The idea that you stand here before us and talk about that you're strong on immigration is on its face the height of hypocrisy,\" Perry said. Romney had employed a landscaping company that was found to have undocumented workers on the payroll. He confronted the landscaper, and when the pattern persisted, the company was fired. So Romney perhaps felt justified when he said, \"I don't think I've ever hired an illegal in my life.\" Perry tried to cut him off and the two candidates got into a verbal scrap, with Romney demanding, \"Are you going to let me finish what I'm saying?\" The audience, which seemed to have a large number of Romney supporters, began booing. There were more free-for-alls like that one before the evening was out. The jeers didn't seem to bother Perry in the least, but he treaded more carefully when the subject of Romney's religion came up. When asked to comment on the remarks of an evangelical pastor who supports Perry and who called Mormonism a cult and said Romney was not a Christian, Perry said America is a country with freedom of expression. \"That individual expressed an opinion. I didn't agree with it, Mitt, and I said so,\" Perry said. For his part, Romney seemed to let it roll off his back. \"You know, with regard to the disparaging comments about my faith, I've heard worse. So I'm not going to lose sleep over that,\" he said. After the debate, which was broadcast by CNN and moderated by Anderson Cooper, Romney spokesman Eric Fehrnstrom said he thought Perry's aggressive behavior backfired. \"Rick Perry had a strategy coming into this debate to kill Mitt, and he ended up killing himself,\" Fehrnstrom said. \"The reason I say that is because of the audience reaction. Every time Perry resorted to a personal attack or a cheap shot, the audience booed.\" But Perry spokesman Ray Sullivan said he liked his candidate's performance and had no regrets. \"We feel like he forcefully defended his record and dominated tonight's debate. That's a win-win for us all around,\" Sullivan said. \"Tonight was a very good night for us and gives us a lot to build on going forward.\" The Republican candidates have debated five times in the past six weeks. The next confrontation isn't until early November, so they have some time to rest up, let the bruises heal and prepare their best shots.",

Perry's comments on education for young illegal immigrants start at about the 5:45 mark. So on Wednesday in an interview with the conservative site Newsmax.tv, Perry tried making amends. \"I probably chose a poor word to explain that. For people who don't want their state to be giving tuition to illegal aliens, illegal immigrants in this country, that's their call and I respect that. \"I was probably overpassionate in using that word and that was probably inappropriate.\" Mitt Romney has hammered Perry for supporting the Texas law that allows young illegal immigrants to receive in-state tuition at the state's public universities so long as the students spent at least three years in the state's K-12 schools. Romney has said the tuition break amounts to a $100,000 subsidy for each undocumented student attending Texas schools. In his Newsmax.com interview, Perry repeated his explanation that providing in-state tuition to such students was uncontroversial in Texas. \"In Texas in 2001 we had, of 181 members of the legislature only four voted against this piece of legislation, because it wasn't about immigration it was about education.\"",

Undocumented Guatemalan immigrants in Arizona are body-searched before boarding a deportation flight to Guatemala in June.\n                \n                    \n                    John Moore/Getty Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption Undocumented Guatemalan immigrants in Arizona are body-searched before boarding a deportation flight to Guatemala in June. It provided a glimpse of the emotional debate that  surrounds illegal immigration \u2014 from Congress' continuing inability to pass  comprehensive reform to disagreement over how to manage the nation's border  with Mexico. --Federal legislation known as the DREAM Act died in  Congress last year, a decade after it was formulated as a bipartisan effort to  provide conditional residency status to young illegal immigrants who meet  certain education or military service requirements. --Some conservatives, including a number of GOP  presidential candidates, have called for repeal of a provision of the 14th  Amendment that bestows citizenship on anyone born on U.S.  soil. --Advocacy groups continue to press for laws that would  declare English as the nation's official language, and to ditch requirements that  federal documents and election ballots be printed in other languages. --And many, including most of the Republican candidates,  continue to press for construction of a fence between the U.S. and Mexico. The Department of Homeland  Security early this year canceled a \"virtual fence\" project after determining it  was too expensive and ineffective \u2014 after already spending $1 billion on the  project. As the Republican candidates head to another debate in Florida next week, we compiled the their statements about  immigration, some from recent debates, and some from earlier in their political  careers. The Minnesota congresswoman has co-sponsored legislation that would designate English as the official language in the U.S. She has also co-sponsored legislation that would eliminate birthright citizenship for children born to illegal mmigrants. In 2010, she voted against the DREAM Act. When the former CEO of Godfather's Pizza was asked during a June 13 Republican presidential candidates debate whether children born in the U.S. to illegal immigrants should automatically be citizens, he said: \"I don't think so.\" In 2007, the former U.S. House Speaker called for ending requirements that federal documents be printed in different languages. In an article for the conservative publication Human Events, he also advocated printing ballots in English, asserted that English should be a requirement for citizenship, and called for replacing bilingual education with intensive English instruction. In the past, he has endorsed a guest worker program that could lead to citizenship. As Utah's governor, he signed a bill granting driving privileges to illegal immigrants who would be allowed to apply for a \"driving privilege\" card stamped with \"Not Valid For Identification.\" The long-time Texas congressman and physician in 2008 co-sponsored a bill that would have required government services be provided in English only. In 2007, he co-sponsored a bill to declare English the nation's official language, and he opposed the DREAM Act as \"backdoor amnesty.\" Paul introduced legislation in 2006 to amend the Constitution to end \"automatic birthright citizenship.\" Asked in a 2010 interview with Newsweek whether he'd like to see the Constitution changed to end birthright citizenship for children of illegal immigrants, the Texas governor responded: \"Is it being abused today? It may be. Does it rise to the level of having a constitutional prohibition? Probably not.\" (In the same interview, when asked if he was running for president, Perry said. \"Not going to run for president. Not going to be a vice presidential candidate. Not going to be in anybody's cabinet.\") In 2002, the future Massachusetts governor favored a ballot initiative that eventually ended the state's bilingual education program. When running for president in 2007, he said: \"On the birthright citizenship issue, we're still looking at it.\" Romney has been criticized for changing positions on an immigration overhaul proposal by GOP Sen. John McCain of Arizona, characterizing it as \"reasonable\" in a 2005 interview with the Boston Globe, and as \"amnesty\" by the time he was running for president against McCain in 2008. The former Pennsylvania senator supports mandating English as the country's official language, has voted for building a fence along the U.S. border with Mexico and has voted against allowing illegal immigrants to participate in Social Security.",

Stop Rick Perry. That was the goal of the other Republican presidential candidates who came to the CNN/Tea Party Express debate Monday evening, to make GOP voters see the Texas governor and front-runner for their party's presidential nomination as less of a shiny new object and more as damaged goods. By the end of the two-hour debate in Tampa, Fla., his rivals may not have knocked him out of the lead but they gave any Republican voters with doubts about Perry plenty more to fuel their concerns. From his hostility to Social Security to his mandating of HPV vaccinations of 12-year-old girls in Texas to how much credit he really deserves for his state's economic growth, Perry had to endure repeated thwacks to his 11-year record as governor. And because it was a debate co-sponsored by a group whose members are among the most conservative Republicans, Perry even drew audience boos when the discussion turned to his support of  in-state tuitions for young undocumented immigrants. Still, his determination to appear unfazed and even-tempered amid all the incoming fire may have impressed some viewers trying to discern his temperament. Mitt Romney, the former Massachusetts governor who lost his frontrunner status to Perry, continued to attack the Texan's opposition to Social Security, a line of assault Romney started at last week's debate. ROMNEY: ... The term \"Ponzi scheme\" I think is over the top and unnecessary, and frightful to many people.  But the real issue is that in writing his book Governor Perry pointed out that, in his view, that Social Security is unconstitutional, that this is not something the federal government ought to be involved in, that instead it should be given back to the states... But Romney's criticism of Perry's Social Security stance was just a warm-up for attacks to come. When the conversation turned to Perry's controversial executive order mandating the HPV vaccine be administered to adolescent girls in Texas to protect them from the cervical-cancer causing virus spread by sexual activity, Perry was battered by Rep. Michele Bachmann and Rick Santorum, the former U.S. senator from Pennsylvania. Family values voters are particularly hostile to the HPV vaccine which many argue sends young people the wrong message about premarital sex. Bachmann and Santorum appeal to those voters, as does Perry on many other issues. Indeed, Perry's official entry into the race in August on the same day that Bachmann won the Ames Straw Poll in Iowa drained away much of Bachmann's prior support from evangelicals and Tea Party activists. The HPV discussion gave Bachmann, especially, a much-needed prybar to try to peel away some of those conservatives the GOP refers to as values voters away from Perry and back towards her candidacy. Perry admitted his vaccine executive order was a mistake. But that wasn't enough to placate Bachmann who was a more aggressive presence than she was at last week's debate. BACHMANN: I'm a mom, and I'm a mom of three children. And to have innocent little 12-year-old girls be forced to have a government injection through an executive order is just flat-out wrong.  (Cheers, applause.)  That should never be done.  That's a violation of a liberty interest.  That's \u2014 little girls who have a negative reaction to this potentially dangerous drug don't get a mulligan.  They don't get a do-over.  The parents don't get a do-over. But more than this, Bachmann made a point that others have also made, one  that could be even more damning in the eyes of many voters than the mandate itself. She noted that the vaccine, Gardasil, was made by a company, Merck, who Perry's former chief of staff served as a lobbyist. She suggested the existence of a quid pro quo, saying the pharmaceutical company had given Perry thousands of dollars in campaign contributions. To which Perry responded: I raise about $30 million, and if you're saying that I can be bought for 5,000 (dollars), I'm offended.  (Applause.) To some wags, this response had the unintentional effect of making it sound like the Texas governor actually had a price at which he could be bought, something north of $5,000. Perry then tried to fuzz up the issue by saying that he saw the vaccine as part of the seamless culture of life he's been trying to promote in Texas. It was a stretch. But matters were getting a little desperate at that point. PERRY:  Look, I think we've made decisions in Texas.  We've put a $3 billion effort in to find the cure for cancer. There are a lot of different cancers out there. Texas, I think, day in and day out is a place that protects life. I have passed parental notification pieces of legislation. I've been the most pro-life governor in the state of Texas. And what we were all about was trying to save young people's lives in Texas.  (Applause.) Rep. Ron Paul got his licks in on Perry, too. During a part of the debate when Perry claims to have overseen significant growth of the Texas' economy were under heavy scrutiny, Paul said his own Texas tax bill had doubled under Perry. And not just that. He got off one of the evening's best zingers. Of the Texas economic miracle, he said: So I would put a little damper on this, but I don't want to offend the governor, because he might raise my taxes or something. (Laughter, applause.) But even though Paul is often viewed as one of the spiritual fathers of the Tea Party movement, he wasn't immune to being booed for his own unpopular views. When he repeated a frequent Paul trope that the U.S. has invited terrorist attacks on itself as blowback to its actions overseas, some audience members lustily booed. The stretch when Perry defended his record on immigration may have been one of the better moments of the evening for him. True, he was booed by some audience members for being insufficiently tough on illegal immigrants by not wanting to build a fence and not taking a hard line against young illegal residents of Texas who seek in-state tuition rates at Texas' public universities. Still, he didn't waver. PERRY: We were clearly sending a message to young people regardless of what the sound of their last name is that we believe in you, that if you want to live in the state of Texas and you want to pursue citizenship that we're going to allow you the opportunity to be contributing members in the state of Texas and not be a drag on our state. For the Obama White House, this may have been one of the most ominous moments of the debate. While Perry's views on Social Security make him a  dream candidate for President Obama to run against, the governor's less punitive approach to young illegal immigrants differs from much of the rest of his party. Democrats have counted on the general Republican hard-heartedness towards young undocumented immigrants to increase the Democratic Party's appeal to Latino voters in 2012, helping to provide Obama the support he needs to win states like Colorado, Nevada, New Mexico and re-election. Perry's position on this issue, at least, complicates that calculation. Jon Huntsman, who has been mired in the low end of the polls, tried to make the point whenever he had the chance, that he was actually a truer conservative than Perry or Romney on immigration and mandates, respectively. He repeatedly referred to his experience as Utah's governor. But he often came across more as gratuitously snarky than anything else. As when after Perry said, among other things, that he opposed a border fence, Huntsman said: Well, first of all, let me \u2014 let me say for Rick to say that you can't secure the border I think is pretty much a treasonous comment. It was an allusion to Perry's controversial comments about Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke that came across as ill-placed swaggering Texas macho when the governor said it and a cheap shot coming from Huntsman. Nothing that happened during the debate appeared to shift the dynamics of the race which still appeared to be a two-person contest between Perry and Romney. In other words, nothing happened to set either Newt Gingrich, the former House speaker, or Herman Cain, the one-time pizza company chief executive, on the path to the GOP nomination. But these debates are participated in by those with an actual chance to get the nomination and those who see no downside to the kind of free publicity that comes from being on the debate stage, the sort of exposure that can't hurt when it comes to selling books or speaking fees. So as long as they continue to garner enough support in the polls to appear on the stage with Perry and Romney, Gingrich and Cain are also debate winners.",

Michele  Bachmann, Mitt Romney, Texas Gov. Rick Perry, Rep. Ron Paul, Herman Cain and Jon Huntsman, Jr. take the stage before the  start of the Ronald Reagan Centennial GOP Presidential Primary  Candidates  Debate at the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library Wednesday in Simi Valley, Calif. Coming into Wednesday's Republican presidential debate at the Reagan Library, many of the questions revolved around Texas Gov. Rick Perry, the newest entrant in the field and instant frontrunner. How well would he perform his first time on the national debate stage? Would he emerge from the debate with his momentum intact or deliver up a gaffe that would stop it cold? Also, how would he handle the inevitable questions about controversial attacks on entitlement programs in his book Fed Up, including his derision of Social Security as a Ponzi scheme? The early indications after the debate carried on MSNBC were that he did nothing obvious to send him sliding out of frontrunner status. Not that he didn't say some things that left many scratching their heads. Defending his skepticism of the scientific consensus that humans are contributing to global warming by saying the 17th century scientist Galileo was once in the minority, too, was odd to say the least. Galileo was on the side of scientific empiricism just like the 98 percent of climate scientists who say humans are making the planet warmer. Despite all that, Perry seemed to pass his first test. And having done so, he should presumably gain in confidence which could make his debate performances going forward even stronger. The debate also clearly demonstrated that Mitt Romney, the previous frontrunner and former Massachusetts governor, intends to make Perry pay a political price for trashing some of the most popular federal entitlement programs that exist. That was another question coming into Wednesday's debate. Would Romney go on the offensive against Perry who had overtaken him as frontrunner? Or, would Romney continue to look past his Republican rivals as he has done for months and direct all his attacks against President Obama? Romney decided to do some of both. The two men leading the Republican field went after each other early on who had the better record on job creation. That part of the fight between the two men was crystallized by this exchange where they each charged that the other's gubernatorial predecessors did a better job with their respective state economies than the man on the stage who was the target of his attacks. PERRY: ... Michael Dukakis created jobs three times faster than you did, Mitt. ROMNEY: Well, as a matter of fact, George Bush and his predecessor created jobs at a faster rate than you did, Governor. (LAUGHTER) PERRY: That's not correct. ROMNEY: Yes, that is correct. That both men in this point and counterpoint contradicted conservative dogma that the private sector, not government, creates jobs seemed equally lost on Perry and Romney during that charged moment. While this part of the debate had the feel of an early round in a prize fight where two fresh armed pugilists throw flurries of punches looking for an early knockout and come away tied on points, Romney later appeared to get the advantage when the discussion turned to Perry's book. Perry adamantly stuck to his charge that Social Security was, besides a Ponzi scheme, a \"monstrous lie\" to future generations. He obviously decided if he was in for a dime, he might as well be in for a dollar. Romney called Perry on the claim in the Texas governor's book that Social Security was a \"failure.\" And one got the sense that Romney would be calling Perry on this one all the way to the caucuses and primaries of early next year. And who could blame him? Hadn't Perry provided him with a gift that should keep on giving? Heck, Romney even was getting some tag team help against Perry from Karl Rove, the George W. Bush White House political strategist who once worked for Perry, too. Rove had earlier in the day called Perry's Social Security position \"toxic.\" Perry was asked about that and let slip the cheery good ol' boy mask if just for a moment: PERRY: You know, Karl has been over the top for a long time in some of his remarks. So  I'm not responsible for Karl anymore. As expected, Romney was attacked by Perry and others on the stage for signing into law as Massachusetts governor a health care law with an individual mandate. Obama has, unhelpfully to Romney, called if a model for the federal Affordable Care Act despised by conservatives as \"Obamacare.\" Asked by Politico editor John Harris if it was ever appropriate for the federal or state governments to mandate citizens to purchase health insurance, Jon Huntsman, the former Utah governor and Obama administration ambassador to China said \"Absolutely not.\" Huntsman proved to be an interesting case study. Of all the candidates on the debate stage, he was by far the most improved. His goal was to come across as the reasonable conservative with centrist appeal, common sense appeal and he struck the right note repeatedly. He chided Romney for threatening to open a trade war with China if the Chinese don't take steps to end unfair practices, like keeping their currency artificially low. \"And I'd have to say, Mitt, now is not the time in a recession to enter a trade war,\" Huntsman said. Huntsman also continued his broadside against Perry for doubting the science behind evolution as well as the contribution of humans to climate change. HUNTSMAN: Listen, when you make comments that fly in the face of what 98 out of 100 climate scientists have said, when you call into question the science of evolution, all I'm saying is that, in order for the Republican Party to win, we can't run from science. We can't run from mainstream conservative philosophy. We've got to win voters. If Huntsman had his strongest performance yet, answering questions with an incisiveness that was lacking in earlier appearances, the same couldn't be said for Rep. Michele Bachmann of Minnesota whose support has fallen precipitously in recent polls, with much of it going to Perry who appeals strongly to the same social conservatives she had. If one moment summed up how the debate went for her, it was her rambling answer to an immigration question. Asked how she would handle the more than 11 million undocumented immigrants in the country, she explained that she was recently in Miami and met with Cuban Americans who opposed giving government benefits to illegal immigrants. Then she extolled the U.S. immigration system of the 1950s and early 1960s as a model the nation should return to. If she was aware that Cuban immigrants have received preferential treatment under U.S. immigration law since the communist takeover on their native island or that the immigration statutes of the 1950s contained racial restrictions, she didn't let on. As for the other candidates, both Rep. Ron Paul of Texas and Newt Gingrich, the former House speaker, played the role they have in past debates. Paul suggested that the free market could regulate itself if only the government would step out of the way. Responding to a question from NBC News anchor Brian Williams, he even went so far as to suggest that the invisible hand of capitalism could regulate car makers: PAUL: ...And, I mean, do we need the federal government to tell us whether we buy a safe car? I say the consumers of America are smart enough to decide what kind of car they can buy and whether it's safe or not, and they don't need the federal government hounding them and putting so much regulations on that our car industry has gone overseas. Unfortunately, there was no followup question to Paul involving classic, real life auto industry calamities like the exploding gas tanks of Ford Pintos of the 1970s or the rollovers of Ford Explorers with Firestone tires in the early 2000s. Gingrich, meanwhile, aimed most of his aggressiveness not at his rivals for the nomination but at the news media, at one point accusing Politico's Harris of trying to instigate a disagreement between Republicans (aren't disagreements the point of debates?) Rick Santorum, the former U.S. senator from Pennsylvania and Herman Cain, the former chief executive of Godfather's Pizza, continued to gamely fill out the stage. Cain plugged his 9-9-9 tax plan which would set rates for corporate, personal and national sales taxes at nine percent, explaining that religious tithing generally requires 10 percent and that the government should be able to get by with less than God. Santorum pitched his plan which goes even further than Cain's, cutting the corporate tax rate from 35 percent to zero. That played to Santorum's message that he's the truest conservative of all the candidates. But like several other candidates on the stage, it doesn't appear to be his year as he struggles far back in the pack. After two hours of the debate, the race, like the night, still appeared to belong to Perry and Romney and probably in that order. Separately, NPR's Scott Horsley had a chance to check a few facts. He writes: JOBS: No big whoppers here, but certainly some selective history.  Newt Gingrich, for example, mentioned the recession that Ronald Reagan inherited from Jimmy Carter, but failed to mention the bigger, deeper recession that struck on Reagan's own watch in 1982 and '83, in which unemployment jumped to 10.4 percent. Gingrich also discussed the strong job growth in the 1990s, suggesting that welfare reform was a contributing factor.  He failed to mention the tax rates in that era were higher than the ones that today's congressional Republicans routinely describe as \"job killing.\" ENERGY: Romney appeared to link high oil prices with Obama administration limits on energy production.  In fact, domestic oil production in 2010 was the highest in seven years. In a global oil market, it's doubtful that fluctuations in domestic production will have a meaningful impact on prices.  It's also unclear what Romney meant when he accused the Obama administration of blocking nuclear plants.  The current administration has been a strong backer of nuclear power, although enthusiasm dimmed somewhat in the wake of the Fukushima Daichi disaster. SOCIAL SECURITY: Rick Perry toned down his opposition to Social Security, but repeated his claim that it's a \"Ponzi scheme\" and a \"monstrous lie\" for younger workers.  He's correct that Social Security in its current form is not sustainable, but probably exaggerates the size of the shortfall. The latest trustees' report says that even without any changes, Social Security could keep paying all of its bills for the next 25 years and fully three-quarters of what retirees expect after that.  Relatively modest fixes could put the system on a sustainable path.",

Orrin Hatch may be breathing a sigh of relief now that Rep. Jason Chaffetz has made it official that he won't mount a primary challenge to the six-term senator's re-election. Chaffetz, who had the support of Tea Party activists, had become a significant worry for Hatch. While viewed as a conservative by most measures (the American Conservative Union has given him a lifetime rating of 89.47 percent) the 77-year old Hatch had angered Tea Party Republicans by taking several stances that have led his critics to call him a Republican in Name Only (RINO.) He sponsored the DREAM Act, a bill meant to provide educational and work opportunities to young people brought illegally into the country by undocumented immigrant parents. He also was a force behind passage of the State Children's Health Insurance Program alongside the archetypal liberal, the late Sen. Ted Kennedy who was one of his closest friends. But any daylight between Hatch and the Tea Party disappeared in recent months following the loss last year of his former Senate colleague from Utah, Robert Bennett, to a Tea Party-backed challenger, Sen. Mike Lee. Hatch was widely assumed to be looking over his right shoulder at Chaffetz who could and did claim to being ideologically purer than Hatch. serving his second term in Congress, Chaffetz received a perfect score from the ACU. The 44-year old congressman is viewed as an emerging star among House Republicans. He was the chief sponsor, for instance, of the GOP's spending-cuts only \"Cut, Cap and Balance\" legislation. Senate Democrats rejected the bill during the debt ceiling fight. The  Utah Republican Party's nominating process had Hatch especially  vulnerable to a  Chaffetz challenge.  In fact, Chaffetz is credited with  developing the strategy  used to defeat incumbent Bennett last year. Bennett's 18 years  in office and deeply-rooted  political and religious pedigree couldn't save him  from the grassroots,  Tea Party effort to keep him off the Republican primary  ballot. Political organizer Frank Anderson was one of the  architects of the  effort to unseat Bennett.  Anderson repeatedly cited the Jason Chaffetz   experience when describing the anti-Bennett  strategy. Chaffetz unseated 6-term congressman Chris Cannon in  2008. \"We  started a series of home cottage meetings for close to two  years,\" Anderson recalled in an NPR  interview last year.  \"Seventy to 80  percent of the attendees at the meetings would  be signing up as  volunteers.  We had over a thousand unpaid  volunteers.\" Motivated Republican supporters are key to getting  elected in Utah. The nominating process begins with  neighborhood caucuses, where  attendees select delegates to the state  convention.  Delegates often  announce their support for specific candidates  before caucus attendees  vote. \"Those  who show up are the ones who become the party,\" Anderson noted. Chaffetz fell just one percent short of the 60 percent  needed to  oust Cannon from office at the state convention.  But the message he   sent was unmistakable.  Cannon was vulnerable and Chaffetz won in the   primary. Anderson and others fine-tuned the strategy and applied  it to Bennett. Polls  indicated that Bennett was headed for re-election  in the primary and  general elections.  But Tea Party activists and  strict constitutionalists  dominated the neighborhood caucuses and the  state convention. They were  overwhelmingly opposed to Bennett,  defeating him at the state convention and  keeping him out of a primary. \"It's  all about motivation, motivation to get involved in this  caucus system,\"  Anderson said.   \"The election is pretty much decided  through the caucus system and conventions  long before you ever get to a  primary or general  election.\" Hatch would have faced the same strategy and challenge. Hatch saw it coming and  has worked hard to develop his own grassroots  support.  He's also been reaching  out to the activist Republicans who  tend to attend neighborhood caucuses and  state conventions. There  are still challengers ready to try the same thing but none  have the experience  or political cachet Chaffetz used to revolutionize  Utah politics.",

Some observers might view as a cynical bid for Hispanic votes the Obama Administration's new policy to review as many as 300,000 illegal immigration cases to focus more on deporting criminals than undocumented individuals posing little to no risk to society. The decision would use some of the criteria of the DREAM Act, which failed to get through Congress, to show leniency to young people, especially students and military veterans brought illegally to the U.S. as small children by their undocumented immigrant parents. The administration framed its decision as a way to target its immigration resources on the highest priority cases, those illegal immigrants whose criminality represents a true threat to the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement officials are being given significantly more latitude to exercise their discretion under the new rules. No doubt the decision will be welcomed by many immigrant advocates and the communities they represent, who have pleaded with the administration to show compassion. It's not the comprehensive immigration reform many Latinos have hoped for. It's a significant step, however. But the new policy definitely cuts both ways. Illegal immigration stirs passions like few other issues. So there's a risk to President Obama that it gives his conservative opposition yet another issue to energize their voters around. It's already being called a \"backdoor\" or \"de facto  amnesty\" by some critics. It's not just Republicans who may be fired up against the policy, however. Even some voters in Obama's political base, especially some African Americans, could wind up being upset by the decision. With the economy only grudgingly creating jobs and black unemployment more than twice as high as the nine percent national average, some African Americans could take their frustrations out on Obama, perhaps staying home on Election Day 2012 than voting. So one of the things to watch for will be whether or not the policy change is a net plus for Obama.",

            "article_content": "Texas governor Rick Perry declared Saturday that he's entering the race for the Republican presidential nomination. Perry spoke at the Red State Gathering conference in Charleston, S.C. WFAE's Julie Rose reports.  JOHN YDSTIE, host: Governor Perry made his announcement at a conference of conservative activists yesterday. Julie Rose records from Charleston, South Carolina. JULIE ROSE: He's a gun-toting, boot-wearing, God-fearing, snappy-dressing, career politician, but Governor Perry introduced himself to the Presidential race this way: Governor RICK PERRY: I stand before you today as the Governor of Texas. But I also stand before you, the son of two tenant farmers. ROSE: On the farm he learned to work hard and pinch pennies. In the Governor's office... PERRY: We balanced our budget, not by raising taxes, but by setting priorities and cutting government spending. ROSE: And that's his plan for the country - along with repealing President Obama's signature Healthcare Law. All of which strikes a chord with Pennsylvania conservatives Bob Sklaroff and Bob Guzzardi who were attending the conference. BOB SKALROFF AND BOB GUZZARDI: We are, The Bob. Two minds, one voice. Rick Perry's the guy. His jobs record, states rights and we see that Perry has delivered for years as a governor. ROSE: Texas has created more jobs than any other state since the end of the recession in 2009, but the Obama campaign calls Perry's economic record a tall tale. High energy prices are a boon for oil-rich Texas. Perry says, if elected, he'll lower taxes, limit regulation and put a stop to frivolous lawsuits. PERRY: This president and his big spending, big government policies has prolonged our national misery, not alleviated it. (SOUNDBITE OF APPLAUSE) ROSE: Many conservatives, like Tabitha Hale, with the Tea Party group FreedomWorks, thinks Perry fills an important gap in the Republican field. She's still undecided, but... TABITHA HALE: I think a lot of people are waiting for one person that can not only get the Tea Party vote, but can also get middle-of-the-road Republicans. ERICK ERICKSON: I think Rick Perry could be the guy to get traction. ROSE: That's Erick Erickson, the founder of the influential conservative blog RedState.com. Erickson likes Perry a lot, but he and others say the candidate has some weaknesses. For example... PHYLLIS NEMETH: My big concern with him is his stand on illegal immigration. ROSE: Phyllis Nemeth is from Arcadia, California. Perry has called the border-fence idiocy and supports giving in-state tuition to undocumented students. Another factor that may trouble some voters is the easy comparison between Perry and his fellow Texan and former boss, George W. Bush. And then there are the half-serious-sounding statements Perry has made in support of Texas seceding from the union. Perry says he's a proud American, but wants to put the federal government in its place. PERRY: I'll work everyday to try to make Washington, D.C. as inconsequential in your life as I can. (SOUNDBITE OF APPLAUSE AND CHEERING) ROSE: First though, Perry needs to make up for lost time. He went straight from South Carolina to New Hampshire last night. Today he's due in Iowa, a day late for the straw poll. But nearly six months ahead of the caucuses that begin the actual nominating process. For NPR News, I'm Julie Rose in Charleston.

The nine justices report back to the Supreme Court on Monday to consider a new docket of cases. It has the potential to be a dynamic term, with decisions on cases concerning health care, immigration and digital privacy expected. David Savage, Supreme Court reporter for the Los Angeles Times and Chicago Tribune, and former U.S. Solicitor General Neal Katyal previewed the session for Talk of the Nation today. They highlighted the following key cases to watch for. -- On health care: Wednesday, the Justice Department asked the Court to rule on challenges to President Obama's health care law. The 11th Circuit Court of Appeals in Atlanta ruled the mandate unconstitutional; another court in Cincinnati has upheld it. \"The Supreme Court's almost certainly got to intervene,\" says Savage. And the Justice Department, he says, is confident they'll win. The Supreme Court will have to decide whether the commerce clause can mandate minimum coverage for all. The best argument against it, Katyal says, is that this would be the first time Congress has ever forced people to engage in purchasing. \"There is an element of novelty to it,\" he says, but the Justice Department would argue \"that element is not as dramatic as the ... plaintiffs characterize it,\" and there is no anti-novelty provision in the Constitution. On immigration: Arizona passed SB 1070, the law that would enlists local police in enforcement of immigration laws. The Obama administration argues immigration is exclusively a federal matter. \"The question is who can enforce the immigration laws,\" says Savage. \"Is it only the federal government, or can states like Arizona and Alabama pass their own immigration laws?\" On privacy: Police officers wanted more information on a suspect, so they put a GPS device on his Jeep and tracked his movements for a full month. He was arrested and convicted on drug charges, but the court of appeals threw it out, calling it an unreasonable search. \"The question is, do you have any right to privacy when you're traveling in public,\" says Savage, or can the government track you without a warrant or even a suspicion you're up to no good? In past cases, watching people in public spaces hasn't necessitated a warrant. \"The question is a really hard one,\" says Katyal, because new technologies allow governments to aggregate data in new ways, which might mean the law needs to change too. \"Normally you would think this person wouldn't have much of a claim because he was traveling on a public street,\" says Savage. But what if states put tracking devices, say, in every license plate, to look for suspicious movements or patterns. \"Would most Americans think that that seems like an unreasonable search, or ... power that the government should have?\" It's also a policy question, says Katyal, \"about what governments should be doing in the future.\" Sarah Handel is a producer for Talk of the Nation.",

            "article_content": "President Obama on Tuesday travels to El Paso, Texas, where he's expected to talk about immigration and his goals for legislation this year. The president is trying to push a plan that would include a path to legalizing undocumented workers.  RENEE MONTAGNE, Host: It's MORNING EDITION from NPR News. I'm Renee Montagne. STEVE INSKEEP, Host: Here's NPR's national political correspondent Mara Liasson. MARA LIASSON: Immigration is back on President Obama's front burner. Today in El Paso, Texas, he'll continue his new push for immigration legislation, which began with a series of high profile meetings at the White House and a speech at the Miami Dade College commencement late last month. BARACK OBAMA: I strongly believe we should fix our broken immigration system. (SOUNDBITE OF APPLAUSE AND CHEERING) OBAMA: Fix it so that it meets our 21st century economic and security needs. And I want to work with Democrats and Republicans, yes, to protect our borders and enforce our laws, and address the status of millions of undocumented workers. LIASSON: After the last attempt at immigration legislation died in the lame duck session of Congress, Hispanic leaders took out their frustration on the White House. They wanted the president to do more to fulfill his campaign pledge to pass a bill, and now he is. LUIS GUTIERREZ: I have to tell you, we're headed in the right direction. I'm more optimistic than I've been in recent memory. LIASSON: Mr. Obama told a Univision town hall meeting that while he couldn't get the Dream Act through Congress, he does have the power to shift the emphasis of law enforcement away from young illegals. OBAMA: We have redesigned our enforcement practices under the law to make sure that we're focusing primarily on criminals. And so our deportation of criminals are up about 70 percent, our deportation of non-criminals are down, and that's because we want to focus our resources on those folks who are destructive to the community. LIASSON: So the president has reassured his own base on this issue, but now he needs a bipartisan process in Congress, and on that score Gutierrez isn't optimistic. GUTIERREZ: When we had a majority of 40 votes in the House and 10 in the Senate, we didn't do it and we couldn't do it even during the lame duck session. It's very unlikely we're going to do it now. LIASSON: Republicans say they want to pass bills that would enhance border security - not legalize undocumented workers. But GOP strategist Marty Wilson thinks that's shortsighted. Wilson ran Carly Fiorina's Senate race in California, a race he says she lost because she didn't get enough Hispanic votes. MARTY WILSON: The hard line approach on immigration, which is find them, arrest them and throw them out, is not going to work. You know, Latinos are a growing population. In a state like California, they're a growing political force, and unless we come up with a better way to talk about immigration, we're going to continue to way underperform, and that does not indicate that you're going to win many elections. LIASSON: Wilson thinks Republicans should add a guest worker program to their border security bills - that would allow them to appear welcoming to Hispanics without angering their conservative base with talk of amnesty. WILSON: It would be politically smart for the Republican to come up with an approach to immigration that while it may not go as far as the president would propose, would still come up with some meaningful reform and I think politically it would do the Republicans a lot of good.

Looked at another way, the rise in the numbers of people who identified themselves as Hispanics accounted for more than half the growth in the U.S. population over the decade. Meanwhile, the minority population, driven predominantly by that sizable surge  in the Hispanic population, grew in virtually every state, propelling significant overall population growth in states in the South and Southwest. The population gains in states like Texas, Florida and Nevada mean they will gain more seats as a result of reapportionment even as Ohio and Michigan lose seats. In the short-term, that's could help Republicans who generally control governorships and state legislatures in those states adding congressional seats. But, again, much of the population growth is driven by Hispanics. And Hispanics skew heavily Democratic. For instance, even last November when a Republican wave swept Republicans into power in the U.S. House, Hispanics voted almost 2 to 1 for Democrats. So some of the states and congressional districts that were previously safely Republican red could start looking more purple. Meanwhile, blacks are moving in significant numbers out of cities like Chicago, Washington, D.C., Los angeles and Detroit where they have long resided and moving to suburbs. They are also moving to the South. Ever since the great realignment of the New Deal when blacks began to leave the Republican Party of Abraham Lincoln for the Democratic Party of Franklin D. Roosevelt, blacks have been overwhelmingly Democrats. As the number of African-Americans rises in suburbs that may have previously been more white and Republican, some of these places will become more purple, too, and be increasingly in play. On the other hand one benefit, at least for Democrats, of past residential segregation which locked blacks into certain areas of metropolitan geography was that it made it easier for state legislators to draw black districts, safeguarding certain seats for the Democratic Party. Still, at first blush, it would seem that the net impact of the changing landscape favors the Democratic Party. Democrats as a party, for instance, have been more favorably disposed towards immigration reform than Republicans. Republicans, for their part, have been split on the issue. The part of the GOP that is hostile to the idea of providing a path to legal status, which they call an amnesty, to illegal immigrants has had more sway than those Republicans who favor reform. That's not to say that all Democrats favor easing the path to citizenship for illegal immigrants. Some African Americans, for instance, have long worried about undocumented workers who they see as competing with them for jobs and public services. Those feelings were likely made more acute by the Great Recession. But the way the immigration debate has played out in recent years certainly seems to be to the advantage of Democrats in the competition for Hispanic votes. President Obama, whose re-relection was favored by 66 percent of Hispanics surveyed by a recent Pew Research Center Poll, called for a debate on immigration reform in this year's State of the Union. And he no doubt will keep calling for it on the campaign trail. The demographic shifts in the nation could also lead to an intensification in racial voting as white, black and Hispanic voters respond on consciously or subconsciously to the nation's changing majority-minority patterns. Obama only got 43 percent of the white vote in 2008 and the recent Pew poll showed just 36 percent of whites in the survey favoring his re-election compared with 92 percent of black voters. Again, Hispanics supported his re-election at a 66 percent rate. In U.S. history, the growing influence of groups viewed as outsiders by the majority has sometimes resulted in backlash. That was true when the federal government increased civil-rights protections for blacks led to what had once been the Solid South to shift from the Democratic to Republican parties. Whatever happens, the nation is hurtling toward an unprecedented moment. As NPR's Alex Kellogg reported on Morning Edition, because of the fast Hispanic population growth, the date when demographers estimate that the nation's minorities will, when added together, number more than whites has been moved closer to the present. It now looks like it will happen in 2042. That's 550 years after Christopher Columbus arrived in the New World as the vanguard of the then new minority group in the Americas known as Europeans.",

Here, Herbert speaks after his inauguration in January.\n                \n                    \n                    Scott Sommerdorf/AP\n                    \n                \nhide caption Gov. Gary R. Herbert recently signed four immigration bills that bring sweeping changes to his state's laws. Here, Herbert speaks after his inauguration in January. Ever since Arizona passed its tough immigration law penalizing undocumented workers, other states have been considering similar laws. But so far, no Arizona-type legislation has passed. Instead, one state has chosen a different approach that it hopes will become an alternative model for dealing with the illegal immigration problem. Utah Conservatives Learn From Arizona If you were to choose a state that would allow illegal immigrants to work and drive without fear of deportation, you probably wouldn't pick Utah. \"We have to understand, Utah is one of the most conservative states in the country,\" says Alfonso Aguilar, who runs the Latino Partnership for Conservative Principles. He says that Utah's new law shows that Republicans can find a middle course. \"The governor's Republican; the House and Senate are dominated by Republicans,\" Aguilar says. \"And they saw what happened in Arizona. They passed an enforcement-only law. It has driven away investment, business, workers that the Arizona economy needs.\" In Utah, Aguilar says, \"they wanted to deal with enforcement \u2014 but balance it with measures that are more business-friendly. And that's exactly what they did.\" Last Wednesday, Utah's Gov. Gary R. Herbert signed a package of immigration bills. One is an enforcement law, milder than Arizona's, but still opposed by liberal immigration advocates. Another is a guest-worker bill, which is opposed by some conservatives as amnesty. Facing Reality, And Allowing Workers To Stay State Rep. Bill Wright, who wrote part of the law, says he was just trying to deal with the reality that there are 11 million illegal immigrants in America, and they are never going to be deported. \"I'm of the opinion that we really don't have the ability as a society to remove that large a portion of a segment from our society \u2014 either the cost, or just the damage it would do,\" Wright says. \"A lot of these people are intertwined in our society. They have financial obligations: They have bank notes; they've bought houses; they contribute; they have jobs,\" he says. Operating from that premise, Wright's guest-worker permit law says that if you pay a fine, have no criminal record and are working, you can stay in Utah. A Rough Draft Of National Reform? Utah's new law has thrilled immigration reform advocates like Frank Sharry, founder of America's Voice. \"The Utah legislation is a very rough draft of what we call comprehensive immigration reform at the national level,\" Sharry says. \"It combines enforcement and a program to make those here legal,\" he says. Sharry says that in Utah, \"what you have is, in a ruby-red state, some legislators and the governor; and the Mormon Church; and a conservative think tank; leading the way towards a more enlightened approach towards immigration.\" The think tank Sharry is referring to is the Utah Compact, a group convened with the governor's blessing to come up with an alternative to the Arizona approach. Aguilar says he hopes Utah's plan will have an impact on the stalled immigration debate in Washington. \"We need a federal solution,\" he says. \"We don't want to see a patchwork of state legislation on immigration. Hopefully, this will pressure the government, the federal government, to do something.\" Now along comes Utah, asking the federal government to do something very soon. As Bill Wright explains, Utah needs the Obama administration to give it a waiver so it can enact the guest worker law. \"Up to this point, the federal government has proved that they're null and void of any ideas because of the political environment there,\" Wright says. \"They have not been able to accomplish it. We want some action, we want something done. If we continue to do nothing, if we continue to do enforcement only, all we'll have is a continuing of what we've had the last 35 years. We've decided that's not good enough.\" Looking For Washington To Act The last attempt at immigration reform died in the Senate in December. Although the debate in Washington seems hopelessly polarized, there are Republicans who fear they can't win a presidential election if their party continues to be seen as anti-Hispanic. And President Obama wouldn't want to  face Hispanic voters in 2012 without trying again to fulfill his promise to pass immigration reform. So, Sharry says, how the administration responds to Utah's request for a waiver will be an important test. \"The fact is that it is a rough draft on the state level of what we call comprehensive immigration reform, which Obama is for,\" Sharry says. \"For him not to figure out how to engage with Utah, and try to make it work, would be a big mistake.\" The White House has been planning to make another push for immigration legislation sometime in the next couple of months. Utah's new guest-worker law could force the president to speed up his timetable.",

Susana Martinez, seen here on election night, won on a platform calling for law and order, smaller government and  deregulation.\n                \n                    \n                    William Faulkner/AP\n                    \n                \nhide caption New Mexico Republican Gov. Susana Martinez, seen here on election night, won on a platform calling for law and order, smaller government and  deregulation. New Mexico Gov. Susana Martinez has pledged to fill a $450 million budget deficit without raising taxes. She wants a more business-friendly state with fewer regulations. But critics say her new policies only please oil and gas producers, who contributed generously to her campaign. 'Open For Business' Martinez swept to victory last year on a wave of anti-incumbent support from 54 percent of voters. Her platform: law and order, smaller government and deregulation. In her state of the state address, she outlined her solidly Republican agenda. Martinez promised to help small businesses create jobs and improve the state's stumbling economy. \"The big corporations have a team of lawyers and accountants to help them,\" she said. \"It's the small businesses, the mom and pop shops, that get lost in the layers of red tape. We will help them and in doing so, send a loud message and a very clear message: New Mexico is open for business.\" The big corporations have a team of lawyers and accountants to help them. It's the small businesses, the mom and pop shops, that get lost in the layers of red tape. New Mexico Gov. Susana Martinez 'A New Sheriff In Town' John Horning, executive director of WildEarth Guardians, an environmental group, says that even though Martinez calls it being open for business, it's open for polluters. He served on the Environmental Improvement Board that approved the state's new greenhouse gas cap-and-trade rules late last year. On Martinez's very first day in office, she froze all pending new regulations, including cap-and-trade, saying she wanted to make sure they didn't hurt businesses. Environmental groups sued to have the rules go into effect, and the state Supreme Court ruled in their favor. Still, Horning is not optimistic. \"I think it is a foreboding sign for those of us who had hoped that New Mexico would lead the way on a clean-energy economy,\" he says. Under the previous administration of Democratic Gov. Bill Richardson, the cap-and-trade policies underwent a lengthy review process and years of litigation before they were approved by the board. \"We definitely have a new sheriff in town,\" says Republican State Sen. Clinton Harden. Harden says the state's regulatory system was abused under the previous, Democratic administration. He'd like to see the whole process repeated \u2014 this time, with Martinez's Republican appointees conducting the review.  \"In order for New Mexico to put [out] an 'open for business' sign, we need to make these decisions based on sound science and not political rhetoric,\" he says. Crime And Punishment Getting rid of environmental regulations isn't the only thing on Martinez's agenda. As district attorney in southern New Mexico, Martinez made a name for herself prosecuting high-profile murder, sexual assault and child abuse cases. She worked for more than two decades in Las Cruces, a city less than an hour from the U.S.-Mexico border and the ongoing violence of drug cartels. Early in her law career, Martinez says, she knew which side of the courtroom she wanted to be on. She remembers one specific case she observed while working as a law clerk: A man was accused of killing his wife. \"And that's when I decided I needed to be on the prosecution side \u2014 to make sure things were done right and that people like him, who kill their wives in domestic violence, are held accountable,\" she says. As governor, Martinez is spearheading an effort to require DNA samples from everyone arrested for a felony. The first Latina governor in the U.S. also wants to take driver's licenses away from undocumented immigrants. And she just signed an executive order requiring state police to ask criminal suspects about their immigration status.",

NPR reporters analyze what the president said (and didn't) about the issues they cover: Jobs Faced with painfully slow U.S. job growth and a 9.4 percent unemployment rate, President Obama spent the lion's share of his State of the Union speech talking about jobs and job creation. He mentioned jobs in at least 20 separate paragraphs. The president noted the economy is growing again, and stock prices and corporate profits are up sharply. But he said that's not the only way Americans measure progress. \"We measure progress by the success of our people,\" he said, \"by the jobs they can find and the quality of life those jobs offer.\" But the president said that in a globalized world economy, the question is \"whether new jobs and industries take root in the U.S. rather than somewhere else around the world.\" To insure jobs come to Americans, he said, \"We need to out-innovate, out-educate, and out-build the rest of the world.\" Clean EnergyCompetitivenessEarmarksEducationElectric CarsHealth CareImmigrationIraq And AfghanistanJobsTransportation The president again focused on job creation through the development of clean energy industries (read more). He called for an end to billions of dollars in tax subsidies for oil companies, saying, \"I don't know if you've noticed, but they're doing just fine on their own.\" He added: \"So instead of subsidizing yesterday's energy, let's invest in tomorrow's.\" He set a goal of producing 80 percent of America's electricity with clean energy by 2035. Obama also called for a cut in America's corporate tax rate to support economic growth, competitiveness and investment in the United States. It's now the highest in the world, though American companies pay less than many other nations because of loopholes and tax subsidies. The president suggested eliminating many of those tax breaks to allow overall rates to fall. Much of the job creation envisioned by the president would come from rebuilding America's \"crumbling\" infrastructure. Saying that to attract businesses, America needs \"the fastest, most reliable ways to move people, goods and information,\" he called for investment not only in roads and bridges, but also in high-speed rail and the Internet. He said his goal was to give 4 out of 5 Americans access to high-speed rails within 25 years (read more). Within five years, he said, 98 percent of Americans should have access to the next generation of high-speed wireless. Mindful of Republicans' vow to cut government spending, the president offered no dollar figure for additional spending on his 21st century infrastructure vision.  He did try to answer the Republicans by extending his proposed freeze on domestic spending from three years to five. That would save $400 billion over the next decade, according to the president. But the freeze would cover only 12 percent of federal spending and make only a small dent in the nation's budget problems. \u2014 John Ydstie Health Care President Obama tried to lighten the mood over the nasty health care debate by telling the assembled supporters and opponents, \"I've heard rumors that a few of you have some concerns about the new health care law.\" But he seemed completely serious when he said that while he was willing to discuss changes that would \"improve\" the measure \u2014 starting with repeal of a funding provision that would impose new paperwork requirements on small businesses \u2014 he remains steadfastly opposed to a full-blown repeal of the sort approved by the House last week. \"What I'm not willing to do is go back to the days when insurance companies could deny someone coverage because of a pre-existing condition,\" the president said. \"I'm not willing to tell James Howard, a brain cancer patient from Texas, that his treatment might not be covered.\" (Howard was a guest in the first lady's box.) But the president did reach out to Republicans on other health issues, particularly deficit reduction. He offered further, unspecified, reductions to the Medicare and Medicaid programs beyond those in the health law. And he said he would also look at \"medical malpractice reform to rein in frivolous lawsuits.\" On the other hand, the White House fact sheet on the speech mentioned support for \"state reforms of medical malpractice systems,\" rather than the federal damage award caps that Republicans want and most Democrats oppose. Meanwhile, in the official Republican response to the president, House Budget Committee Chairman Paul Ryan of Wisconsin was to say that Republicans remain committed to erasing the health law from the books entirely, because it \"is accelerating our country toward bankruptcy.\" \u2014 Julie Rovner Earmarks \"And because the American people deserve to know that special interests aren't larding up legislation with pet projects, both parties in Congress should know this: If a bill comes to my desk with earmarks inside, I will veto it,\" President Obama said. Obama's only veto threat was against any bills containing congressional earmarks. His opposition to such congressionally directed spending, often for pet projects in members' districts, dates back to his days in the Senate. But as president, Obama has good reason to oppose earmarks: He prefers having his own federal agencies decide how best to spend the money Congress appropriates. By taking that stance, the president appears to be making common cause with congressional Republicans. House Republicans have sworn off all earmarks, and their Senate counterparts have adopted a non-binding resolution to do the same. So the president is essentially putting his own party on notice about earmarks. And Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid \u2014 himself a seasoned earmarker \u2014 is having none of it. \"I think it's the wrong thing to do,\" he told reporters at the Capitol. \"It's a lot of pretty talk, but it is only giving the president more power. He's got enough power already.\" \u2014 David Welna Iraq And Afghanistan Domestic issues, not foreign policy or national security, were priorities in President Obama's speech, as they were last year. His discussion of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan was relatively brief and as positive as possible, with a renewed commitment to withdrawing U.S. troops. \"The war in Iraq is coming to an end,\" Obama said, citing the reduction of violence and the installation of a new government there. In Afghanistan, he said, fewer Afghans \"are under the control of the [Taliban] insurgency.\" In fact, casualties in Iraq have declined dramatically, both for U.S. troops (60 killed in 2010 versus 904 in 2007) and for Iraqi civilians (4,036 in 2010, down from 24,677 in 2007, according to the independent Iraq Body Count project). But the level of violence in Iraq remains high, and the seeds of renewed sectarian strife and political instability have been planted with the return to Iraq of Moqtada al-Sadr, whose Iran-backed Shiite militia was responsible for much anti-Sunni violence in earlier years. In Afghanistan, the situation is even less clear. The independent Afghanistan NGO Safety Office (ANSO) reported that in the last quarter of 2010, Taliban attacks declined in Kandahar and Helmand provinces, the focus of the U.S. troop surge. But attacks in those provinces, according to the most recent ANSO quarterly report, had increased dramatically earlier in the year. For all of 2010, insurgent attacks in Afghanistan increased by the highest annual growth rate ever recorded, according to ANSO data, and the group reported that the Taliban insurgency secured new strongholds in the north, west and east of the country. U.S. commanders nevertheless remain confident that success in Afghanistan is still possible. Army Maj. Gen. John Campbell, who commands U.S. troops in eastern Afghanistan, predicted earlier this month that Afghan security forces would soon be in charge of 40 percent of the Afghan population in the portion of the country under his control. \"If we can get to 40 percent, that's when we start making this irreversible momentum,\" he said. \u2014 Tom Gjelten Clean Energy The president wants Congress to help him set a new goal of producing  80 percent of America's electricity from clean energy by 2035. He  includes wind, solar, nuclear, clean coal and natural gas as all playing  a part. He stresses that a new clean electricity standard will  stimulate a market for innovative technologies and will create green  jobs. There aren't many details available yet for how this new standard  would work. But one thing is clear: House Republicans are unlikely to  embrace any plan that would force a switch from coal, which now  generates about half of the country's electricity. Last year, the president urged Congress to pass a climate change bill  to accomplish the same goal, but he dropped that strategy after what he  called his \"shellacking\" in the last election. In his speech, the  president didn't mention global warming as a reason for switching to  clean energy. \u2014 Elizabeth Shogren Transportation The president's exhortation to modernize the nation's transportation infrastructure \u2014 in particular, its railways and highways \u2014 was made to a Congress that has been unable for the last year and a half to reauthorize the National   Highway and Transportation Safety Act. This is largely because revenues from the Highway Trust Fund \u2014 derived from the federal gasoline tax \u2014 don't even cover the cost of projects already in the pipeline, and lawmakers are reluctant to make up the difference from general funds. They're just as unwilling to raise the gasoline tax, which has been 18.3 cents per gallon since 1993. Because cars are more fuel efficient these days, revenues have fallen further. The president did not propose any way to cover that gap. President Obama also said he wants 80 percent of the population to have access to high speed rail within 25 years. Building such railways costs about $45 million per mile, money the private sector appears unlikely to invest. The last big stimulus bill included $8 billion in seed money for high-speed rail, but it's divided among many regions. And the new Republican governors of Wisconsin and Ohio \u2014 two states that got some of that seed money \u2014 are now turning down the funds. The president seemed to tacitly acknowledge what a heavy lift it may be to build such rail lines. While he praised China for its fast trains, he later alluded to how simple it is for certain central governments that want a railroad to get one, no matter how many homes get bulldozed. By contrast, he said, \"We will argue about everything. The cost. The details.  Every letter of the law.\" \u2014 David Welna What He Didn't Mention: Guns Glaringly absent from the president's address (at least to those who were hoping to hear something on the subject) was any mention of guns. The president who campaigned promising to reinstate the lapsed ban on assault weapons remained mum on arms restrictions, even as he recognized those who'd been shot in Tucson. The bullets that were fired at them, police say, were packed in a high capacity magazine that had been outlawed under that lapsed assault weapons ban. Democrats in both the House and Senate recently introduced bills to reinstate that ban; tonight's speech was a high profile opportunity for the president to throw his weight behind that legislation. He chose not to take it. \u2014 David Welna Updated at 11:37 p.m. ET \u2014 More analysis has come in from NPR reporters: Education President Obama said the United States must \"out-educate, out-innovate and out-build\" the rest of the world. In that context, he said, the United   States must target its investments in areas such as education. He pointed to nations like China and India, which can compete in the global economy in part because they start educating children \"earlier and longer, with greater emphasis on math and science.\" (Read more about Obama's comparisons.) His point was underscored by U.S. Education Department findings that show just how much American students have slipped in science \u2014 two-thirds lack even the most basic knowledge. The president also pointed out that the United States places ninth in the proportion of young people with a college degree. \"To compete, higher education must be within reach of every American,\" the president said. Across the country, meanwhile, states have slashed funding for higher education, forcing community colleges to cap enrollment, eliminate programs, lay off faculty and raise tuition. Obama also said too many elementary and secondary schools are not performing well. \"That's why instead of just pouring money into a system that's not working, we launched a competition called Race to the Top,\" the president said. \"To all 50 states, we said, 'If you show us the most innovative plans to improve teacher quality and student achievement, we'll show you the money.'\" That money \u2014 about $4.5 billion \u2014 went to 11 states and the District of   Columbia. To get it, the winners agreed to such measures as closing down struggling schools and adopting tests tied to rigorous standards. One area in which the president has found a great deal of Republican support is in his effort to improve teacher quality \u2014 and take on the teachers' unions on issues like merit pay. \"We want to reward good teachers and stop making excuses for bad ones,\" the president said. But otherwise, the message from Republicans was clear: Education has to be on the chopping block. Republicans are proposing a 20 percent cut that administration officials say would \"decimate\" school reform, as well as access to college. \u2014 Claudio Sanchez Immigration The president's call for Congress to \"take on, once and for all, the issue of illegal immigration\" is likely more an expression of his own support for that issue than a recognition of lawmakers' willingness to do so. Even before Republicans took control of the House, there was not one Republican in the Senate willing to join Democrats on comprehensive immigration reform \u2014 after South Carolina Republican Lindsey Graham dropped his support. Until unemployment levels drop significantly, allowing undocumented foreigners to gain legal status is going to be a very tough sell in Congress. \u2014 David Welna Competitiveness In calling for innovation, new industries and millions of jobs, President Obama said, \"This is our generation's Sputnik moment.\" That reference to the time when the Soviet Union beat the United States into space with the first launch of a satellite was echoed at various points in his speech, with the president saying that other countries have moved ahead of the United States in some respects. He pointed out that the U.S. lead in infrastructure \"has slipped.\" He said South Koreans have more Internet access than Americans, while countries in Europe and Russia \"invest more in their roads and railways than we do.\" China, he noted, \"is building faster trains and newer airports.\" He made similar comparisons with respect to education issues, noting that in South Korea, \"teachers are known 'as nation builders.'\" \u2014 Tom Gjelten Electric Cars The president's goal of a million electric cars on the road by 2015 would definitely be quite a stretch. David E. Cole, an auto industry expert from the University of Michigan, says he's very optimistic about electric cars, but reaching the president's target would be \"very, very difficult.\" That's because of the high cost of the lithium batteries that charge the cars. Despite high price tags, demand for electric vehicles has been strong. Nissan says it has 20,000 people on a waiting list for its 100 percent electric Leaf. And GM recently announced that due to strong public interest, it would increase production of its plug-in hybrid electric Volt cars to 45,000 in 2012. But it's a long way from tens of thousands to a million. \u2014 Elizabeth Shogren",

And as we mark this occasion, we are  also mindful of the empty chair in this Chamber, and pray for the health of our  colleague \u2013 and our friend \u2013 Gabby Giffords. It's  no secret that those of us here tonight have had our differences over the last  two years. The debates have been contentious; we have fought fiercely for our  beliefs. And that's a good thing. That's what a robust democracy demands. That's  what helps set us apart as a nation. But  there's a reason the tragedy in Tucson gave us pause. Amid all the noise and  passions and rancor of our public debate, Tucson reminded us that no matter who  we are or where we come from, each of us is a part of something greater \u2013  something more consequential than party or political  preference. We  are part of the American family. We believe that in a country where every race  and faith and point of view can be found, we are still bound together as one  people; that we share common hopes and a common creed; that the dreams of a  little girl in Tucson are not so different than those of our own children, and  that they all deserve the chance to be fulfilled. That,  too, is what sets us apart as a nation. Now,  by itself, this simple recognition won't usher in a new era of cooperation. What  comes of this moment is up to us. What comes of this moment will be determined  not by whether we can sit together tonight, but whether we can work together  tomorrow. I  believe we can. I believe we must. That's what the people who sent us here  expect of us. With their votes, they've determined that governing will now be a  shared responsibility between parties. New laws will only pass with support from  Democrats and Republicans. We will move forward together, or not at all \u2013 for  the challenges we face are bigger than party, and bigger than  politics. At  stake right now is not who wins the next election \u2013 after all, we just had an  election. At stake is whether new jobs and industries take root in this country,  or somewhere else. It's whether the hard work and industry of our people is  rewarded. It's whether we sustain the leadership that has made America not just  a place on a map, but a light to the world. We  are poised for progress. Two years after the worst recession most of us have  ever known, the stock market has come roaring back. Corporate profits are up.  The economy is growing again. But  we have never measured progress by these yardsticks alone. We measure progress  by the success of our people. By the jobs they can find and the quality of life  those jobs offer. By the prospects of a small business owner who dreams of  turning a good idea into a thriving enterprise. By the opportunities for a  better life that we pass on to our children. That's  the project the American people want us to work on.  Together. We  did that in December. Thanks to the tax cuts we passed, Americans' paychecks are  a little bigger today. Every business can write off the full cost of the new  investments they make this year. These steps, taken by Democrats and  Republicans, will grow the economy and add to the more than one million private  sector jobs created last year. But  we have more work to do. The steps we've taken over the last two years may have  broken the back of this recession \u2013 but to win the future, we'll need to take on  challenges that have been decades in the making. Many  people watching tonight can probably remember a time when finding a good job  meant showing up at a nearby factory or a business downtown. You didn't always  need a degree, and your competition was pretty much limited to your neighbors.  If you worked hard, chances are you'd have a job for life, with a decent  paycheck, good benefits, and the occasional promotion. Maybe you'd even have the  pride of seeing your kids work at the same company. That  world has changed. And for many, the change has been painful.  I've seen it in  the shuttered windows of once booming factories, and the vacant storefronts of  once busy Main Streets. I've heard it in the frustrations of Americans who've  seen their paychecks dwindle or their jobs disappear \u2013 proud men and women who  feel like the rules have been changed in the middle of the  game. They're  right. The rules have changed. In a single generation, revolutions in technology  have transformed the way we live, work and do business. Steel mills that once  needed 1,000 workers can now do the same work with 100.  Today, just about any  company can set up shop, hire workers, and sell their products wherever there's  an internet connection. Meanwhile,  nations like China and India realized that with some changes of their own, they  could compete in this new world. And so they started educating their children  earlier and longer, with greater emphasis on math and science. They're investing  in research and new technologies. Just recently, China became home to the  world's largest private solar research facility, and the world's fastest  computer. So  yes, the world has changed. The competition for jobs is real. But this shouldn't  discourage us. It should challenge us. Remember \u2013 for all the hits we've taken  these last few years, for all the naysayers predicting our decline, America  still has the largest, most prosperous economy in the world. No workers are more  productive than ours. No country has more successful companies, or grants more  patents to inventors and entrepreneurs. We are home to the world's best colleges  and universities, where more students come to study than any other place on  Earth. What's  more, we are the first nation to be founded for the sake of an idea \u2013 the idea  that each of us deserves the chance to shape our own destiny. That is why  centuries of pioneers and immigrants have risked everything to come here.  It's  why our students don't just memorize equations, but answer questions like \"What  do you think of that idea? What would you change about the world? What do you  want to be when you grow up?\" The  future is ours to win. But to get there, we can't just stand still.  As Robert  Kennedy told us, \"The future is not a gift. It is an achievement.\" Sustaining  the American Dream has never been about standing pat. It has required each  generation to sacrifice, and struggle, and meet the demands of a new  age. Now  it's our turn. We know what it takes to compete for the jobs and industries of  our time. We need to out-innovate, out-educate, and out-build the rest of the  world. We have to make America the best place on Earth to do business. We need  to take responsibility for our deficit, and reform our government. That's how  our people will prosper.  That's how we'll win the future. And tonight, I'd like  to talk about how we get there. The  first step in winning the future is encouraging American  innovation. None  of us can predict with certainty what the next big industry will be, or where  the new jobs will come from. Thirty years ago, we couldn't know that something  called the Internet would lead to an economic revolution. What we can do \u2013 what  America does better than anyone \u2013 is spark the creativity and imagination of our  people.  We are the nation that put cars in driveways and computers in offices;  the nation of Edison and the Wright brothers; of Google and Facebook. In  America, innovation doesn't just change our lives. It's how we make a  living. Our  free enterprise system is what drives innovation. But because it's not always  profitable for companies to invest in basic research, throughout history our  government has provided cutting-edge scientists and inventors with the support  that they need.  That's what planted the seeds for the Internet. That's what  helped make possible things like computer chips and GPS. Just  think of all the good jobs \u2013 from manufacturing to retail \u2013 that have come from  those breakthroughs. Half  a century ago, when the Soviets beat us into space with the launch of a  satellite called Sputnik\u00b8 we had no idea how we'd beat them to the moon. The  science wasn't there yet. NASA didn't even exist.  But after investing in better  research and education, we didn't just surpass the Soviets; we unleashed a wave  of innovation that created new industries and millions of new  jobs. This  is our generation's Sputnik moment. Two years ago, I said that we needed to  reach a level of research and development we haven't seen since the height of  the Space Race. In a few weeks, I will be sending a budget to Congress that  helps us meet that goal.  We'll invest in biomedical research, information  technology, and especially clean energy technology \u2013 an investment that will  strengthen our security, protect our planet, and create countless new jobs for  our people. Already,  we are seeing the promise of renewable energy. Robert and Gary Allen are  brothers who run a small Michigan roofing company. After September 11th, they  volunteered their best roofers to help repair the Pentagon. But half of their  factory went unused, and the recession hit them hard. Today,  with the help of a government loan, that empty space is being used to  manufacture solar shingles that are being sold all across the country. In  Robert's words, \"We reinvented ourselves.\" That's  what Americans have done for over two hundred years: reinvented ourselves. And  to spur on more success stories like the Allen Brothers, we've begun to reinvent  our energy policy. We're not just handing out money. We're issuing a challenge.   We're telling America's scientists and engineers that if they assemble teams of  the best minds in their fields, and focus on the hardest problems in clean  energy, we'll fund the Apollo Projects of our time. At  the California Institute of Technology, they're developing a way to turn  sunlight and water into fuel for our cars. At Oak Ridge National Laboratory,  they're using supercomputers to get a lot more power out of our nuclear  facilities.  With more research and incentives, we can break our dependence on  oil with biofuels, and become the first country to have 1 million electric  vehicles on the road by 2015. We  need to get behind this innovation. And to help pay for it, I'm asking Congress  to eliminate the billions in taxpayer dollars we currently give to oil  companies. I don't know if you've noticed, but they're doing just fine on their  own. So instead of subsidizing yesterday's energy, let's invest in  tomorrow's. Now,  clean energy breakthroughs will only translate into clean energy jobs if  businesses know there will be a market for what they're selling. So tonight, I  challenge you to join me in setting a new goal: by 2035, 80% of America's  electricity will come from clean energy sources. Some folks want wind and solar.  Others want nuclear, clean coal, and natural gas. To meet this goal, we will  need them all \u2013 and I urge Democrats and Republicans to work together to make it  happen. Maintaining  our leadership in research and technology is crucial to America's success. But  if we want to win the future \u2013 if we want innovation to produce jobs in America  and not overseas \u2013 then we also have to win the race to educate our  kids. Think  about it. Over the next ten years, nearly half of all new jobs will require  education that goes beyond a high school degree. And yet, as many as a quarter  of our students aren't even finishing high school. The quality of our math and  science education lags behind many other nations.  America has fallen to 9th in  the proportion of young people with a college degree. And so the question is  whether all of us \u2013 as citizens, and as parents \u2013 are willing to do what's  necessary to give every child a chance to succeed. That  responsibility begins not in our classrooms, but in our homes and communities.  It's family that first instills the love of learning in a child. Only parents  can make sure the TV is turned off and homework gets done.  We need to teach our  kids that it's not just the winner of the Super Bowl who deserves to be  celebrated, but the winner of the science fair; that success is not a function  of fame or PR, but of hard work and discipline. Our  schools share this responsibility. When a child walks into a classroom, it  should be a place of high expectations and high performance. But too many  schools don't meet this test. That's why instead of just pouring money into a  system that's not working, we launched a competition called Race to the Top.  To  all fifty states, we said, \"If you show us the most innovative plans to improve  teacher quality and student achievement, we'll show you the  money.\" Race  to the Top is the most meaningful reform of our public schools in a generation.  For less than one percent of what we spend on education each year, it has led  over 40 states to raise their standards for teaching and learning. These  standards were developed, not by Washington, but by Republican and Democratic  governors throughout the country.  And Race to the Top should be the approach we  follow this year as we replace No Child Left Behind with a law that is more  flexible and focused on what's best for our kids. You  see, we know what's possible for our children when reform isn't just a top-down  mandate, but the work of local teachers and principals; school boards and  communities. Take  a school like Bruce Randolph in Denver. Three years ago, it was rated one of the  worst schools in Colorado; located on turf between two rival gangs. But last  May, 97% of the seniors received their diploma. Most will be the first in their  family to go to college. And after the first year of the school's  transformation, the principal who made it possible wiped away tears when a  student said \"Thank you, Mrs. Waters, for showing\u2026 that we are smart and we can  make it.\" Let's  also remember that after parents, the biggest impact on a child's success comes  from the man or woman at the front of the classroom. In South Korea, teachers  are known as \"nation builders.\" Here in America, it's time we treated the people  who educate our children with the same level of respect. We want to reward good  teachers and stop making excuses for bad ones.  And over the next ten years,  with so many Baby Boomers retiring from our classrooms, we want to prepare  100,000 new teachers in the fields of science, technology, engineering, and  math. In  fact, to every young person listening tonight who's contemplating their career  choice: If you want to make a difference in the life of our nation; if you want  to make a difference in the life of a child \u2013 become a teacher. Your country  needs you. Of  course, the education race doesn't end with a high school diploma. To compete,  higher education must be within reach of every American. That's why we've ended  the unwarranted taxpayer subsidies that went to banks, and used the savings to  make college affordable for millions of students.  And this year, I ask Congress  to go further, and make permanent our tuition tax credit \u2013 worth $10,000 for  four years of college. Because  people need to be able to train for new jobs and careers in today's  fast-changing economy, we are also revitalizing America's community colleges.  Last month, I saw the promise of these schools at Forsyth Tech in North  Carolina. Many of the students there used to work in the surrounding factories  that have since left town. One mother of two, a woman named Kathy Proctor, had  worked in the furniture industry since she was 18 years old.  And she told me  she's earning her degree in biotechnology now, at 55 years old, not just because  the furniture jobs are gone, but because she wants to inspire her children to  pursue their dreams too. As Kathy said, \"I hope it tells them to never give  up.\" If  we take these steps \u2013 if we raise expectations for every child, and give them  the best possible chance at an education, from the day they're born until the  last job they take \u2013 we will reach the goal I set two years ago: by the end of  the decade, America will once again have the highest proportion of college  graduates in the world. One  last point about education. Today, there are hundreds of thousands of students  excelling in our schools who are not American citizens. Some are the children of  undocumented workers, who had nothing to do with the actions of their parents.  They grew up as Americans and pledge allegiance to our flag, and yet live every  day with the threat of deportation. Others come here from abroad to study in our  colleges and universities. But as soon as they obtain advanced degrees, we send  them back home to compete against us. It makes no sense. Now,  I strongly believe that we should take on, once and for all, the issue of  illegal immigration. I am prepared to work with Republicans and Democrats to  protect our borders, enforce our laws and address the millions of undocumented  workers who are now living in the shadows. I know that debate will be difficult  and take time. But tonight, let's agree to make that effort. And let's stop  expelling talented, responsible young people who can staff our research labs,  start new businesses, and further enrich this nation. The  third step in winning the future is rebuilding America. To attract new  businesses to our shores, we need the fastest, most reliable ways to move  people, goods, and information \u2013 from high-speed rail to high-speed  internet. Our  infrastructure used to be the best \u2013 but our lead has slipped. South Korean  homes now have greater internet access than we do. Countries in Europe and  Russia invest more in their roads and railways than we do. China is building  faster trains and newer airports.  Meanwhile, when our own engineers graded our  nation's infrastructure, they gave us a \"D.\" We  have to do better. America is the nation that built the transcontinental  railroad, brought electricity to rural communities, and constructed the  interstate highway system. The jobs created by these projects didn't just come  from laying down tracks or pavement. They came from businesses that opened near  a town's new train station or the new off-ramp. Over  the last two years, we have begun rebuilding for the 21st century, a project  that has meant thousands of good jobs for the hard-hit construction industry.  Tonight, I'm proposing that we redouble these efforts. We  will put more Americans to work repairing crumbling roads and bridges. We will  make sure this is fully paid for, attract private investment, and pick projects  based on what's best for the economy, not politicians. Within  25 years, our goal is to give 80% of Americans access to high-speed rail, which  could allow you go places in half the time it takes to travel by car. For some  trips, it will be faster than flying \u2013 without the pat-down. As we speak, routes  in California and the Midwest are already underway. Within  the next five years, we will make it possible for business to deploy the next  generation of high-speed wireless coverage to 98% of all Americans. This isn't  just about a faster internet and fewer dropped calls. It's about connecting  every part of America to the digital age.  It's about a rural community in Iowa  or Alabama where farmers and small business owners will be able to sell their  products all over the world. It's about a firefighter who can download the  design of a burning building onto a handheld device; a student who can take  classes with a digital textbook; or a patient who can have face-to-face video  chats with her doctor. All  these investments \u2013 in innovation, education, and infrastructure \u2013 will make  America a better place to do business and create jobs.  But to help our  companies compete, we also have to knock down barriers that stand in the way of  their success. Over  the years, a parade of lobbyists has rigged the tax code to benefit particular  companies and industries. Those with accountants or lawyers to work the system  can end up paying no taxes at all. But all the rest are hit with one of the  highest corporate tax rates in the world. It makes no sense, and it has to  change. So  tonight, I'm asking Democrats and Republicans to simplify the system. Get rid of  the loopholes. Level the playing field. And use the savings to lower the  corporate tax rate for the first time in 25 years \u2013 without adding to our  deficit. To  help businesses sell more products abroad, we set a goal of doubling our exports  by 2014 \u2013 because the more we export, the more jobs we create at home. Already,  our exports are up. Recently, we signed agreements with India and China that  will support more than 250,000 jobs in the United States.  And last month, we  finalized a trade agreement with South Korea that will support at least 70,000  American jobs. This agreement has unprecedented support from business and labor;  Democrats and Republicans, and I ask this Congress to pass it as soon as  possible. Before  I took office, I made it clear that we would enforce our trade agreements, and  that I would only sign deals that keep faith with American workers, and promote  American jobs.  That's what we did with Korea, and that's what I intend to do as  we pursue agreements with Panama and Colombia, and continue our Asia Pacific and  global trade talks. To  reduce barriers to growth and investment, I've ordered a review of government  regulations. When we find rules that put an unnecessary burden on businesses, we  will fix them. But I will not hesitate to create or enforce commonsense  safeguards to protect the American people.  That's what we've done in this  country for more than a century. It's why our food is safe to eat, our water is  safe to drink, and our air is safe to breathe. It's why we have speed limits and  child labor laws.  It's why last year, we put in place consumer protections  against hidden fees and penalties by credit card companies, and new rules to  prevent another financial crisis. And it's why we passed reform that finally  prevents the health insurance industry from exploiting  patients. Now,  I've heard rumors that a few of you have some concerns about the new health care  law. So let me be the first to say that anything can be improved. If you have  ideas about how to improve this law by making care better or more affordable, I  am eager to work with you. We can start right now by correcting a flaw in the  legislation that has placed an unnecessary bookkeeping burden on small  businesses. What  I'm not willing to do is go back to the days when insurance companies could deny  someone coverage because of a pre-existing condition.  I'm not willing to tell  James Howard, a brain cancer patient from Texas, that his treatment might not be  covered. I'm not willing to tell Jim Houser, a small business owner from Oregon,  that he has to go back to paying $5,000 more to cover his employees.  As we  speak, this law is making prescription drugs cheaper for seniors and giving  uninsured students a chance to stay on their parents' coverage. So instead of  re-fighting the battles of the last two years, let's fix what needs fixing and  move forward. Now,  the final step \u2013 a critical step \u2013 in winning the future is to make sure we  aren't buried under a mountain of debt. We  are living with a legacy of deficit-spending that began almost a decade ago. And  in the wake of the financial crisis, some of that was necessary to keep credit  flowing, save jobs, and put money in people's pockets. But  now that the worst of the recession is over, we have to confront the fact that  our government spends more than it takes in. That is not sustainable.  Every  day, families sacrifice to live within their means. They deserve a government  that does the same. So  tonight, I am proposing that starting this year, we freeze annual domestic  spending for the next five years. This would reduce the deficit by more than  $400 billion over the next decade, and will bring discretionary spending to the  lowest share of our economy since Dwight Eisenhower was  president. This  freeze will require painful cuts. Already, we have frozen the salaries of  hardworking federal employees for the next two years.  I've proposed cuts to  things I care deeply about, like community action programs. The Secretary of  Defense has also agreed to cut tens of billions of dollars in spending that he  and his generals believe our military can do without. I  recognize that some in this Chamber have already proposed deeper cuts, and I'm  willing to eliminate whatever we can honestly afford to do without. But let's  make sure that we're not doing it on the backs of our most vulnerable citizens.   And let's make sure what we're cutting is really excess weight. Cutting the  deficit by gutting our investments in innovation and education is like  lightening an overloaded airplane by removing its engine. It may feel like  you're flying high at first, but it won't take long before you'll feel the  impact. Now,  most of the cuts and savings I've proposed only address annual domestic  spending, which represents a little more than 12% of our budget. To make further  progress, we have to stop pretending that cutting this kind of spending alone  will be enough. It won't. The  bipartisan Fiscal Commission I created last year made this crystal clear. I  don't agree with all their proposals, but they made important progress. And  their conclusion is that the only way to tackle our deficit is to cut excessive  spending wherever we find it \u2013 in domestic spending, defense spending, health  care spending, and spending through tax breaks and  loopholes. This  means further reducing health care costs, including programs like Medicare and  Medicaid, which are the single biggest contributor to our long-term deficit.   Health insurance reform will slow these rising costs, which is part of why  nonpartisan economists have said that repealing the health care law would add a  quarter of a trillion dollars to our deficit. Still, I'm willing to look at  other ideas to bring down costs, including one that Republicans suggested last  year: medical malpractice reform to rein in frivolous  lawsuits. To  put us on solid ground, we should also find a bipartisan solution to strengthen  Social Security for future generations.  And we must do it without putting at  risk current retirees, the most vulnerable, or people with disabilities; without  slashing benefits for future generations; and without subjecting Americans'  guaranteed retirement income to the whims of the stock  market. And  if we truly care about our deficit, we simply cannot afford a permanent  extension of the tax cuts for the wealthiest 2% of Americans. Before we take  money away from our schools, or scholarships away from our students, we should  ask millionaires to give up their tax break. It's  not a matter of punishing their success. It's about promoting America's  success. In  fact, the best thing we could do on taxes for all Americans is to simplify the  individual tax code. This will be a tough job, but members of both parties have  expressed interest in doing this, and I am prepared to join  them. So  now is the time to act. Now is the time for both sides and both houses of  Congress \u2013 Democrats and Republicans \u2013 to forge a principled compromise that  gets the job done.  If we make the hard choices now to rein in our deficits, we  can make the investments we need to win the future. Let  me take this one step further. We shouldn't just give our people a government  that's more affordable. We should give them a government that's more competent  and efficient. We cannot win the future with a government of the  past. We  live and do business in the information age, but the last major reorganization  of the government happened in the age of black and white TV.  There are twelve  different agencies that deal with exports. There are at least five different  entities that deal with housing policy. Then there's my favorite example: the  Interior Department is in charge of salmon while they're in fresh water, but the  Commerce Department handles them in when they're in saltwater. And I hear it  gets even more complicated once they're smoked. Now,  we have made great strides over the last two years in using technology and  getting rid of waste. Veterans can now download their electronic medical records  with a click of the mouse.  We're selling acres of federal office space that  hasn't been used in years, and we will cut through red tape to get rid of more.  But we need to think bigger.  In the coming months, my administration will  develop a proposal to merge, consolidate, and reorganize the federal government  in a way that best serves the goal of a more competitive America. I will submit  that proposal to Congress for a vote \u2013 and we will push to get it  passed. In  the coming year, we will also work to rebuild people's faith in the institution  of government.  Because you deserve to know exactly how and where your tax  dollars are being spent, you will be able to go to a website and get that  information for the very first time in history. Because you deserve to know when  your elected officials are meeting with lobbyists, I ask Congress to do what the  White House has already done: put that information online.  And because the  American people deserve to know that special interests aren't larding up  legislation with pet projects, both parties in Congress should know this: if a  bill comes to my desk with earmarks inside, I will veto  it. A  21st century government that's open and competent. A government that lives  within its means. An economy that's driven by new skills and ideas. Our success  in this new and changing world will require reform, responsibility, and  innovation. It will also require us to approach that world with a new level of  engagement in our foreign affairs. Just  as jobs and businesses can now race across borders, so can new threats and new  challenges. No single wall separates East and West; no one rival superpower is  aligned against us. And  so we must defeat determined enemies wherever they are, and build coalitions  that cut across lines of region and race and religion. America's moral example  must always shine for all who yearn for freedom, justice, and dignity. And  because we have begun this work, tonight we can say that American leadership has  been renewed and America's standing has been restored. Look  to Iraq, where nearly 100,000 of our brave men and women have left with their  heads held high; where American combat patrols have ended; violence has come  down; and a new government has been formed. This year, our civilians will forge  a lasting partnership with the Iraqi people, while we finish the job of bringing  our troops out of Iraq. America's commitment has been kept; the Iraq War is  coming to an end. Of  course, as we speak, al Qaeda and their affiliates continue to plan attacks  against us.  Thanks to our intelligence and law enforcement professionals, we  are disrupting plots and securing our cities and skies. And as extremists try to  inspire acts of violence within our borders, we are responding with the strength  of our communities, with respect for the rule of law, and with the conviction  that American Muslims are a part of our American family. We  have also taken the fight to al Qaeda and their allies abroad. In Afghanistan,  our troops have taken Taliban strongholds and trained Afghan Security Forces.   Our purpose is clear \u2013 by preventing the Taliban from reestablishing a  stranglehold over the Afghan people, we will deny al Qaeda the safe-haven that  served as a launching pad for 9/11. Thanks  to our heroic troops and civilians, fewer Afghans are under the control of the  insurgency. There will be tough fighting ahead, and the Afghan government will  need to deliver better governance. But we are strengthening the capacity of the  Afghan people and building an enduring partnership with them.  This year, we  will work with nearly 50 countries to begin a transition to an Afghan lead. And  this July, we will begin to bring our troops home. In  Pakistan, al Qaeda's leadership is under more pressure than at any point since  2001. Their leaders and operatives are being removed from the battlefield. Their  safe-havens are shrinking. And we have sent a message from the Afghan border to  the Arabian Peninsula to all parts of the globe: we will not relent, we will not  waver, and we will defeat you. American  leadership can also be seen in the effort to secure the worst weapons of war.  Because Republicans and Democrats approved the New START Treaty, far fewer  nuclear weapons and launchers will be deployed. Because we rallied the world,  nuclear materials are being locked down on every continent so they never fall  into the hands of terrorists. Because  of a diplomatic effort to insist that Iran meet its obligations, the Iranian  government now faces tougher and tighter sanctions than ever before. And on the  Korean peninsula, we stand with our ally South Korea, and insist that North  Korea keeps its commitment to abandon nuclear weapons. This  is just a part of how we are shaping a world that favors peace and prosperity.  With our European allies, we revitalized NATO, and increased our cooperation on  everything from counter-terrorism to missile defense.  We have reset our  relationship with Russia, strengthened Asian alliances, and built new  partnerships with nations like India. This March, I will travel to Brazil,  Chile, and El Salvador to forge new alliances for progress in the Americas.  Around the globe, we are standing with those who take responsibility \u2013 helping  farmers grow more food; supporting doctors who care for the sick; and combating  the corruption that can rot a society and rob people of  opportunity. Recent  events have shown us that what sets us apart must not just be our power \u2013 it  must be the purpose behind it.  In South Sudan \u2013 with our assistance \u2013 the  people were finally able to vote for independence after years of war. Thousands  lined up before dawn. People danced in the streets. One man who lost four of his  brothers at war summed up the scene around him: \"This was a battlefield for most  of my life. Now we want to be free.\" We  saw that same desire to be free in Tunisia, where the will of the people proved  more powerful than the writ of a dictator. And tonight, let us be clear: the  United States of America stands with the people of Tunisia, and supports the  democratic aspirations of all people. We  must never forget that the things we've struggled for, and fought for, live in  the hearts of people everywhere. And we must always remember that the Americans  who have borne the greatest burden in this struggle are the men and women who  serve our country. Tonight,  let us speak with one voice in reaffirming that our nation is united in support  of our troops and their families.  Let us serve them as well as they have served  us \u2013 by giving them the equipment they need; by providing them with the care and  benefits they have earned; and by enlisting our veterans in the great task of  building our own nation. Our  troops come from every corner of this country \u2013 they are black, white, Latino,  Asian and Native American. They are Christian and Hindu, Jewish and Muslim. And,  yes, we know that some of them are gay. Starting this year, no American will be  forbidden from serving the country they love because of who they love.  And with  that change, I call on all of our college campuses to open their doors to our  military recruiters and the ROTC. It is time to leave behind the divisive  battles of the past. It is time to move forward as one  nation. We  should have no illusions about the work ahead of us. Reforming our schools;  changing the way we use energy; reducing our deficit \u2013 none of this is easy. All  of it will take time. And it will be harder because we will argue about  everything. The cost. The details. The letter of every  law. Of  course, some countries don't have this problem. If the central government wants  a railroad, they get a railroad \u2013 no matter how many homes are bulldozed. If  they don't want a bad story in the newspaper, it doesn't get  written. And  yet, as contentious and frustrating and messy as our democracy can sometimes be,  I know there isn't a person here who would trade places with any other nation on  Earth. We  may have differences in policy, but we all believe in the rights enshrined in  our Constitution. We may have different opinions, but we believe in the same  promise that says this is a place where you can make it if you try. We may have  different backgrounds, but we believe in the same dream that says this is a  country where anything's possible. No matter who you are. No matter where you  come from. That  dream is why I can stand here before you tonight. That dream is why a working  class kid from Scranton can stand behind me.  That dream is why someone who  began by sweeping the floors of his father's Cincinnati bar can preside as  Speaker of the House in the greatest nation on Earth. That  dream \u2013 that American Dream \u2013 is what drove the Allen Brothers to reinvent their  roofing company for a new era. It's what drove those students at Forsyth Tech to  learn a new skill and work towards the future. And that dream is the story of a  small business owner named Brandon Fisher. Brandon  started a company in Berlin, Pennsylvania that specializes in a new kind of  drilling technology. One day last summer, he saw the news that halfway across  the world, 33 men were trapped in a Chilean mine, and no one knew how to save  them. But  Brandon thought his company could help. And so he designed a rescue that would  come to be known as Plan B. His employees worked around the clock to manufacture  the necessary drilling equipment. And Brandon left for  Chile. Along  with others, he began drilling a 2,000 foot hole into the ground, working three  or four days at a time with no sleep. Thirty-seven days later, Plan B succeeded,  and the miners were rescued. But because he didn't want all of the attention,  Brandon wasn't there when the miners emerged. He had already gone home, back to  work on his next project. Later,  one of his employees said of the rescue, \"We proved that Center Rock is a little  company, but we do big things.\" We  do big things. From  the earliest days of our founding, America has been the story of ordinary people  who dare to dream. That's how we win the future. We  are a nation that says, \"I might not have a lot of money, but I have this great  idea for a new company. I might not come from a family of college graduates, but  I will be the first to get my degree. I might not know those people in trouble,  but I think I can help them, and I need to try. I'm not sure how we'll reach  that better place beyond the horizon, but I know we'll get there. I know we  will.\" We  do big things. The  idea of America endures. Our destiny remains our choice. And tonight, more than  two centuries later, it is because of our people that our future is hopeful, our  journey goes forward, and the state of our union is  strong. Thank  you, God Bless You, and may God Bless the United States of America. ###",

Jeb Bush waves as he is introduced to the crowd during inauguration ceremonies for Republican Rick Scott on Jan. 4 outside the Old Capitol in Tallahassee, Fla. On Thursday, Bush and other Republican leaders are launching a new effort to reach out to Hispanic voters. Former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush and other Republican leaders are launching a new effort Thursday to reach out to Hispanic voters. The Hispanic Leadership Network is meant to help Republicans and conservatives listen to the Hispanic community and, in the process, figure out how to win more of their votes. Hispanic Republican candidates had some big successes in November: Marco Rubio was elected to the Senate in Florida; Brian Sandoval and Susana Martinez won the governorships of Nevada and New Mexico, respectively. But Republicans overall still lost the Hispanic vote nationwide by about 2-1 -- not much different than in 2008. Bush wants to change that. \"The challenge, though, is that we have a situation right now where Republicans send out signals that Hispanics aren't wanted in our party, not by policy so much as by tone,\" he says. But it's more than just the tone. It's one issue in particular, says Alfonso Aguilar, the executive director of the Latino Partnership for Conservative Principles and a participant in Thursday's conference in Miami. \"Latinos are inherently conservative: They're socially conservative; they are entrepreneurial; they're pro-business. Immigration ... is that one issue that prevents us from winning the support of Latino voters,\" he says. The Issue With Immigration The last attempt at an immigration overhaul in Congress -- a bill that would have allowed young people brought to the U.S. illegally as children to become citizens if they enrolled in the military or college -- got only eight Republican votes in the House and three in the Senate. Frank Sharry, an advocate of immigration overhaul, says that shows how much has changed since President George W. Bush tried to pass a law that would have provided a path to legalization for undocumented workers. \"Republicans have lurched to the right since Jeb Bush's brother made a heroic attempt to pass comprehensive immigration reform back in 2007,\" Sharry says. \"Clearly, there's a tremendous fear among Republicans that primary challenges will result from being centrist on immigration. It's cost them with the fastest-growing group of new voters in the country: Latinos, for whom immigration has become a defining issue.\" Even though anti-immigrant voices seem to be getting louder inside the Republican Party, Jeb Bush is convinced that they do not speak for most on the right. \"That view is in the minority even in the Republican Party,\" he says. \"But, I think if you got to the point where legitimate, emotional concerns about the lack of border security and the lack of rule of law, once those issues subsided, then you would find a great majority of people that would support some solution to the large number of people that are here illegally.\" A New Conversation Bush isn't the only one trying to solve this problem for the GOP: Newt Gingrich, a potential presidential candidate and a thought leader inside the party, talks about creating a zone between amnesty and mass deportation. Columnist Ruben Navarrette, who is also speaking at the conference in Miami, says there is a new conversation going on beneath the surface in the GOP -- particularly when it comes to the push by some Republicans to repeal the 14th Amendment in order to deny birthright citizenship to children born to undocumented parents. \"They're not fools -- they realize that there are those places where they can overplay their hand, and I think the 14th Amendment change is a perfect example of a bridge too far,\" Navarrette says. \"It's poison. You play with that, and I am never, ever going be able to go before a group of Hispanic women ... and convince them that the Republican Party isn't anything but a bunch of ogres.\" A small but encouraging sign to Aguilar is the decision to deny Iowa Rep. Steve King the chairmanship of the House Judiciary Committee's immigration subcommittee. King is one of the party's most strident voices on the issue. \"To me, the message is, 'Steve King, you're too loud and you're saying things that are very offensive. We don't want to see that.' That's a very good first step: Reject the ugly rhetoric,\" Aguilar says. \"The question now is can we propose, can Republicans practically propose immigration solutions that go beyond enforcement only? And if we do, Hispanics will respond very favorably.\" Presidential Politics If Republicans can't go beyond enforcement only, Navarrette says, the GOP is doomed as a national party. \"Demographics do not lie. They will never again elect a Republican president if they don't get this right in short order,\" he says, \"because Hispanics are increasing in population at a rate where they're going to wipe away everything else.\" Hispanics are expected to reach 30 percent of the population by 2050. And speaking of Republican presidents, Sharry thinks it's interesting that only one potential GOP candidate, former Minnesota Gov. Tim Pawlenty, is attending the conference in Miami this week. \"Republicans are flummoxed on how to talk about this issue in a way that doesn't incite the base against them and that reaches out to Latinos and says: 'I get you,' \" he says. \"The only person in the Republican Party who did that successfully was George W. Bush. And he won that coveted threshold of 40 percent of the Latino vote in 2004 that powered his way to re-election.\" And that is the cold, hard math of the GOP's problem. In 2012, they need to find a way to win more than 40 percent of that vote -- and not just in Florida but in other swing states, like Colorado, Arizona, Nevada and New Mexico.",

            "article_content": "As the Republicans prepare to take over the House this week, they're welcoming almost 90 newcomers into their ranks. Here are eight who are poised to stand out.  Kristi Noem (SD-At Large) Her Deal: Two years ago, Noem was a political novice newly elected to her state's Legislature. Today, she's a media darling newly elected to Congress and a member of the incoming Republican House leadership in the newly created position of liaison. News media have nicknamed her the \"Palin of the Plains\": She's attractive, fashionable, feisty, a mother of three -- and she hunts, too. Why She's A Rising Star: Because she raised more money than her incumbent opponent (an uncommon feat), including collecting more than twice as much from individual donors. That ability will quickly ingratiate her with House colleagues looking to fill their re-election coffers. And because she's actually not Palin, already having shown skill at sticking to the conservative policy message and enough smarts to maintain distance from the Tea Party movement and Palin herself. Why You Should Care: She, along with co-liaison Tim Scott of South Carolina, will be the most powerful freshman members. Hers is likely to be the face of the Republican Party's broader strategy for connecting with women and younger voters for years to come (if she keeps winning elections). As the state's lone representative, in an at-large seat, she already holds statewide name recognition that takes others years to build, providing her an advantage for a future bid for the Senate or governor. Martha Roby (AL-2nd District) Her Deal: Roby narrowly defeated Rep. Bobby Bright by tying him to former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, despite Bright's conservative credentials as a Blue Dog Democrat. Bright drew fundraising predominantly from political action committees, while Roby far surpassed him in individual donations -- demonstrating her ability to marshal strong grass-roots support. Like others on this list, she ran with the endorsement of Palin. Why She's A Rising Star: Before taking out the incumbent in the general election, Roby managed to get through a crowded, difficult GOP primary with 60 percent of the vote, another indication of skilled retail politicking at a relatively young age. She's savvy at tailoring national party positions to the local level, such as when she pushed a City Council ordinance that would ban businesses from hiring illegal immigrants. Then there's her pedigree, as the daughter of 11th Circuit Court of Appeals Chief Judge Joel Dubina, an appointee of the first President Bush. Why You Should Care: She's a conservative who campaigned on a hard-line, anti-tax platform. She's a Southerner and a woman, two attributes attractive to both the GOP's geographical base and to swing-voting women. The party already recognizes her potential and put her on its congressional transition team. Tim Scott (SC-1st District) His Deal: Scott may be new to representing his state's 1st Congressional District, but he is no stranger to firsts: the first African-American Republican elected to his county's council since Reconstruction; the first black Republican voted into the South Carolina Legislature in more than a century; and now, the first black Republican elected to Congress from the Deep South since Reconstruction. Why He's A Rising Star: To get to Congress, Scott first had to prevail over the scions of two South Carolina political dynasties: He beat the son of popular former Gov. Carroll Campbell II in the primary, then defeated the son of long-serving U.S. senator and political titan Strom Thurmond in a runoff. He's risen to political leadership at the local, state and, now, joining Noem as the other freshman liaison, federal levels. Even before taking the liaison post, Scott served on the House GOP's transition team. And he's a Tea Party favorite, a conservative's conservative on fiscal matters likely to have no trouble maintaining support from both the upstart and traditional factions on the right. Why You Should Care: At the risk of stating the obvious, because he's a Republican and black -- the first elected, along with Allen West, since J.C. Watts in the 1990s. That combination always is controversial (and contradictory, many believe) and will very likely keep him in the cross hairs of national debates about policies and problems disproportionately affecting African-Americans. Thus, Scott will have to decide if he'll follow in the Watts mold as the GOP's foil to black political orthodoxy. For that reason, in addition to his solid conservative credentials, he'll become one of the more prominent new faces of the Republican Party. Ben Quayle (AZ-3rd District) His Deal: Most politicians announce their candidacies at press conferences, but when you're the son of former Vice President Dan Quayle, you can count on Daddy's help. The elder Quayle told the world of his son's virgin bid for office during an appearance on the Fox News Channel. With that boost, Ben Quayle became the prohibitive favorite, pushing past nine other candidates to win the nomination. An archconservative, he ran into trouble when he denied -- and later admitted -- having written years ago for a risque website about the local nightclub scene. Writing under the pseudonym Brock Landers (a name inspired by a porn star character in the film Boogie Nights), he recounted his hunt for \"the hottest chick in Scottsdale.\" Ahem. He deflected the heat by airing a tough-talking campaign in which he vowed to \"knock the hell\" out of Washington and called President Obama the \"worst president in history.\" Why He's A Rising Star: Given his political heritage, it is almost inevitable that Quayle's will become a familiar face among the chatter chamber of cable news television. Apart from his naughty Web behavior, he's a prototypical conservative lawmaker: staunchly to the right on the big issues, articulately outspoken, well familiar with life in the Beltway bubble, an able fundraiser, and knows how to make a big splash that excites his base. Not to mention that he's handsome, telegenic and young and appears a natural fit in the role of hard-charging reformist. Why You Should Care: Don't expect a son of Dan Quayle to be satisfied sitting on the chamber's back bench for too many years. Remember that before Dad's political career collapsed like a mashed \"p-o-t-a-t-o-e,\" he was the family's original wunderkind. He won a seat in Congress at age 29 and at 33 became the youngest senator ever elected from Indiana. For Ben Quayle, add to the mix the strength of his family name in Arizona politics and it's clear how he beat nine opponents in his first rodeo. Adam Kinzinger (IL-11th District) His Deal: Recaptured a formerly Republican-held seat by defeating incumbent Democrat Debbie Halvorson with a surprisingly impressive 57.5 percent. How? He benefited from the district's disapproval of her votes in favor of the health care overhaul and \"cap-and-trade\" legislation. And he outworked her on the ground. When members of Congress held town halls in their districts about health care in 2009, Halvorson conducted her meetings by phone -- leading Kinzinger to hold his own town halls across the district. The decision won him grass-roots credibility. Voter opinions in Illinois' 11th District, which spans the southwest Chicago exurbs, tracks closely with national polls, and as public support for the Democrats (and Halvorson) waned, Kinzinger had done the spadework to take advantage. Why He's A Rising Star: As a 19-year-old college sophomore, Kinzinger made his first bid for office and defeated a 12-year incumbent to take a seat on his county's governing board. Five years later, he joined the Air Force, earned his pilot's wings and served five tours in Iraq and Afghanistan combined. Visiting Milwaukee one night in 2006, he stopped an attacker who had slashed a woman's neck with a knife. Kinzinger disarmed and subdued the man. By the time he announced his congressional bid in 2009, his background made him irresistible to national GOP leaders looking for the next breakthrough stars. He ran with the endorsement of three 2012 presidential hopefuls, Minnesota Gov. Tim Pawlenty, former Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin and former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney. He's another of the four freshman lawmakers who served on the House transition team. Why You Should Care: Fiscal conservative. Good looks. Self-effacing manner that appeals to Joe Six-Pack voters. Combat veteran. Hero. Hollywood couldn't have sketched a more attractive profile. Plus, Kinzinger represents a swing district in a battleground state. A true bellwether, the 11th district went for Bush twice, then for Obama. Allen West (FL-22nd District) His Deal: West defeated Democratic Rep. Ron Klein after losing to him in 2008. A Tea Party darling and beneficiary of a Palin endorsement, he raised nearly twice as much money as Klein in one of the highest-profile races. West, one of two black Republicans elected this year, has decided to join the Congressional Black Caucus, saying he intends to inject some conservative principles into the liberal group, which is made up of Democratic lawmakers. To that end, he's off to a confrontational start -- calling the caucus a \"monolithic voice that promotes these liberal social welfare policies and programs that are failing in the black community, that are preaching victimization and dependency.\" Why He's A Rising Star: West's hard-charging, gung-ho style arguably already has made him a star. A career Army officer who served in Iraq, he was forced to retire for firing a pistol near the head of a Iraqi police officer whom he was interrogating in 2003. His case, which could have gone to a court-martial, made him a hero to conservative pundits. The incident led 95 members of Congress to sign a letter to the Army secretary in support of West. Since his election, his forceful personality and seeming fearlessness to address sensitive issues has only raised his profile. He's appeared repeatedly on Fox News, been profiled by national news organizations and landed a spot on NBC's Meet the Press, a booking coveted by any member of Congress. Why You Should Care: West (as well as Tim Scott) was a godsend to the GOP. Since J.C. Watts' retirement in 2003, the party has been eager to turn out a new crop of high-profile African-Americans to prove that it, too, can be a big-tent party -- a goal made more urgent with the election of Barack Obama. Republicans poured so much money into West's campaign, it was the second-most expensive House race of the year (the candidates raised a combined $10.2 million). And he is universally respected by veterans and pro-military voters, which helps broaden his appeal. The evidence: Though West is ultraconservative and black, he won comfortably in a district that\u2019s politically moderate and 83 percent white. Yet just as his maverick style endears him to Tea Partiers and other conservatives, it could put West at odds with the GOP House leadership. He criticized Republicans and Democrats who voted to repeal \"don't ask, don't tell,\" calling their decision \"utterly disturbing\" and \"pathetic.\" He also fired off an e-mail to House Majority Leader-designate Eric Cantor chiding the leadership for proposing shorter workweeks for members and more retreats, saying lawmakers should spend more time in session. In addition, he recently committed his first gaffe when he said the news media should be \"censored\" for \"aiding and abetting\" the WikiLeaks disclosures of U.S. diplomacy documents. He then posted a statement on his Facebook page clarifying that he meant \"censure\" or harsh criticism. Raul Labrador (ID-1st District) His Deal: A dark-horse candidate, Labrador pulled an upset primary victory against the Republican establishment's anointed candidate, thanks to Tea Party support. He then defeated Democratic incumbent Walt Minnick in a nasty general election battle. Minnick went negative early, running a widely condemned ad that suggested Labrador -- an immigration attorney born in Puerto Rico -- abetted illegal immigration. In turn, Labrador successfully painted Minnick, a Blue Dog Democrat, as a Nancy Pelosi acolyte -- despite the fact that Minnick disagreed with substantial parts of the Democratic agenda. Why He's A Rising Star: He's a hard-liner on the bread-and-butter party issues -- anti-tax, anti-abortion and anti-amnesty for illegal immigrants, for instance. He's got the support of the Tea Party, but he also draws support from Latinos, who make up about 10 percent of the state population and are growing in number at more than three times the rate of non-Hispanics. And he is one of a record six Hispanic Republicans elected to Congress during the midterms. Why You Should Care: His could be one of the faces carrying the GOP message on immigration. Illegal immigration is a central issue in Idaho, and Labrador has described himself as the most qualified of any member in Congress to address it. Not just because of his ethnicity, but also because of his work as an immigration attorney whose practice represented undocumented Latinos. That presents a curious dynamic: Being Hispanic appears to have inoculated Labrador from criticisms that his legal work undermines his tough stance on the issue. Labrador wants tighter border security, including the use of National Guard troops, and an improved guest worker program. And he adamantly opposes amnesty, preferring that illegal immigrants be made to return to their countries and apply for entry to the U.S. as guest workers or through other lawful means. Notably, he has avoided taking a position on birthright citizenship, though he most likely will have to soon enough, since several powerful GOP members want to end that 14th Amendment right for U.S.-born children of undocumented immigrants. Steve Stivers (OH-15th District) His Deal: Defeated Democratic incumbent Mary Jo Kilroy in a rematch of their 2008 battle, which he lost by less than a percentage point. Many credited Kilroy's victory to Obama's coattails. This year, Kilroy might have won again had Stivers heeded party leaders who asked him to withdraw and run instead for state auditor. Why He's A Rising Star: Stivers has a centrist ideology, humble style and All-American aura. He's known inside the Republican Party as \"golden boy.\" He has unique potential to appeal to a diverse swath of voters because of his varied background and tendency to seek the middle ground on some issues. He's a decorated war veteran, former Wall Street trader and financial industry lobbyist (who supports some degree of financial reform). He supports abortion in cases of rape, incest or to save the mother\u2019s life, and during his tenure in the state Senate he backed legislation to freeze tuition at state colleges, allow the disabled to buy into Medicaid, and provide some medical malpractice protections for doctors who treat uninsured patients. Why You Should Care: Like Kinzinger of Illinois, Stivers represents a swing district. Except this one's in Ohio, historically a bellwether for how the nation will vote in a presidential election. In addition, he represents the state\u2019s most populous city. And he already has the ideal profile, solid support base and party backing to become a viable candidate for higher officer sooner rather than later. In a nod to his political potential as well as his financial background, Stivers recently was tapped to serve on the House Financial Services Committee, which regulates Wall Street. It's a plum assignment for a freshman. He'll sit on a panel with jurisdiction over federal monetary policy and the banking system.  As the Republicans prepare to take over the House this week, they're welcoming almost 90 newcomers into their ranks.

That combination always is controversial (and contradictory, many believe) and will very likely keep him in the cross hairs of national debates about policies and problems disproportionately affecting African-Americans. Thus, Scott will have to decide if he'll follow in the Watts mold as the GOP's foil to black political orthodoxy. For that reason, in addition to his solid conservative credentials, he'll become one of the more prominent new faces of the Republican Party.

The elder Quayle told the world of his son's virgin bid for office during an appearance on the Fox News Channel. With that boost, Ben Quayle became the prohibitive favorite, pushing past nine other candidates to win the nomination. An archconservative, he ran into trouble when he denied -- and later admitted -- having written years ago for a risque website about the local nightclub scene. Writing under the pseudonym Brock Landers (a name inspired by a porn star character in the film Boogie Nights), he recounted his hunt for \"the hottest chick in Scottsdale.\" Ahem. He deflected the heat by airing a tough-talking campaign in which he vowed to \"knock the hell\" out of Washington and called President Obama the \"worst president in history.\" Why He's A Rising Star: Given his political heritage, it is almost inevitable that Quayle's will become a familiar face among the chatter chamber of cable news television. Apart from his naughty Web behavior, he's a prototypical conservative lawmaker: staunchly to the right on the big issues, articulately outspoken, well familiar with life in the Beltway bubble, an able fundraiser, and knows how to make a big splash that excites his base. Not to mention that he's handsome, telegenic and young and appears a natural fit in the role of hard-charging reformist.  Why You Should Care: Don't expect a son of Dan Quayle to be satisfied sitting on the chamber's back bench for too many years. Remember that before dad's political career collapsed like a mashed \"p-o-t-a-t-o-e,\" he was the family's original wunderkind. He won a seat in Congress at age 29 and at 33 became the youngest senator ever elected from Indiana. For Ben Quayle, add to the mix the strength of his family name in Arizona politics and it's clear how he beat nine opponents in his first rodeo. Age: 32 Hometown: Manteno, Ill.

Occupation: Pilot, Air National Guard; U.S. Air Force veteran of Iraq and Afghanistan wars Education: Bachelor's degree, Illinois State University Previous Elected Office: McLean County (Ill.) board member, 1998-2003 His Deal: Recaptured a formerly Republican-held seat by defeating incumbent Democrat Debbie Halvorson with a surprisingly impressive 57.5 percent. How? He benefited from the district's disapproval of her votes in favor of the health care overhaul and \"cap-and-trade\" legislation. And he outworked her on the ground. When members of Congress held town halls in their districts about health care in 2009, Halvorson conducted her meetings by phone -- leading Kinzinger to hold his own town halls across the district. The decision won him grass-roots credibility. Voter opinions in Illinois' 11th District, which spans the southwest Chicago exurbs, tracks closely with national polls, and as public support for the Democrats (and Halvorson) waned, Kinzinger had done the spadework to take advantage. Why He's A Rising Star: As a 19-year-old college sophomore, Kinzinger made his first bid for office and defeated a 12-year incumbent to take a seat on his county's governing board. Five years later, he joined the Air Force, earned his pilot's wings and served five tours in Iraq and Afghanistan combined. Visiting Milwaukee one night in 2006, he stopped an attacker who had slashed a woman's neck with a knife. Kinzinger disarmed and subdued the man. By the time he announced his congressional bid in 2009, his background made him irresistible to national GOP leaders looking for the next breakthrough stars. He ran with the endorsement of three 2012 presidential hopefuls, Minnesota Gov. Tim Pawlenty, former Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin and former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney. He's another of the four freshman lawmakers who served on the House transition team. Why You Should Care: Fiscal conservative. Good looks. Self-effacing manner that appeals to Joe Six-Pack voters. Combat veteran. Hero. Hollywood couldn't have sketched a more attractive profile. Plus, Kinzinger represents a swing district in a battleground state. A true bellwether, the 11th district went for Bush twice, then for Obama. Age: 49 Hometown: Plantation,  Fla.

Occupation: Defense Department contractor; retired U.S. Army veteran Education: Bachelor's degree, University of Tennessee; master's degree, Kansas State University; master's degree, U.S. Army Command and General Staff Officer College Previous Elected Office: None His Deal: West defeated Democratic Rep. Ron Klein after losing to him in 2008. A Tea Party darling and beneficiary of a Palin endorsement, he raised nearly twice as much money as Klein in one of the highest-profile races. West, one of two black Republicans elected this year, has decided to join the Congressional Black Caucus, saying he intends to inject some conservative principles into the liberal group, which is made up of Democratic lawmakers. To that end, he's off to a confrontational start -- calling the caucus a \"monolithic voice that promotes these liberal social welfare policies and programs that are failing in the black community, that are preaching victimization and dependency.\" Why He's A Rising Star: West's hard-charging, gung-ho style arguably already has made him a star. A career Army officer who served in Iraq, he was forced to retire for firing a pistol near the head of a Iraqi police officer whom he was interrogating in 2003. His case, which could have gone to a court-martial, made him a hero to conservative pundits. The incident led 95 members of Congress to sign a letter to the Army secretary in support of West. Since his election, his forceful personality and seeming fearlessness to address sensitive issues has only raised his profile. He's appeared repeatedly on Fox News, been profiled by national news organizations and landed a spot on NBC's Meet the Press, a booking coveted by any member of Congress. Why You Should Care: West (as well as Tim Scott) was a godsend to the GOP. Since J.C. Watts' retirement in 2003, the party has been eager to turn out a new crop of high-profile African-Americans to prove that it, too, can be a big-tent party -- a goal made more urgent with the election of Barack Obama. Republicans poured so much money into West's campaign, it was the second-most expensive House race of the year (the candidates raised a combined $10.2 million). And he is universally respected by veterans and pro-military voters, which helps broaden his appeal. The evidence: Though West is ultraconservative and black, he won comfortably in a district that\u2019s politically moderate and 83 percent white. Yet just as his maverick style endears him to Tea Partiers and other conservatives, it could put West at odds with the GOP House leadership. He criticized Republicans and Democrats who voted to repeal \"don't ask, don't tell,\" calling their decision \"utterly disturbing\" and \"pathetic.\" He also chided the GOP House leadership for proposing shorter workweeks for members and more retreats, saying lawmakers should spend more time in session. In addition, he recently committed his first gaffe when he said the news media should be \"censored\" for \"aiding and abetting\" the WikiLeaks disclosures of U.S. diplomacy documents. He then posted a statement on his Facebook page clarifying that he meant \"censure\" or harsh criticism.

He then defeated Democratic incumbent Walt Minnick in a nasty general election battle. Minnick went negative early, running a widely condemned ad that suggested Labrador -- an immigration attorney born in Puerto  Rico -- abetted illegal immigration. In turn, Labrador successfully painted Minnick, a Blue Dog Democrat, as a Nancy Pelosi acolyte -- despite the fact that Minnick disagreed with substantial parts of the Democratic agenda. Why He's A Rising Star: He's a hard-liner on the bread-and-butter party issues -- anti-tax, anti-abortion and anti-amnesty for illegal immigrants, for instance. He's got the support of the Tea Party, but he also draws support from Latinos, who make up about 10 percent of the state population and are growing in number at more than three times the rate of non-Hispanics. And he is one of a record six Hispanic Republicans elected to Congress during the midterms. Why You Should Care: His could be one of the faces carrying the GOP message on immigration. Illegal immigration is a central issue in Idaho, and Labrador has described himself as the most qualified of any member in Congress to address it. Not just because of his ethnicity but also because of his work as an immigration attorney whose practice represented undocumented Latinos. That presents a curious dynamic: Being Hispanic appears to have inoculated Labrador from criticisms that his legal work undermines his tough stance on the issue. Labrador wants tighter border security, including the use of National Guard troops, and an improved guest worker program. And he adamantly opposes amnesty, preferring that illegal immigrants be made to return to their countries and apply for entry to the U.S. as guest workers or through other lawful means. Notably, he has avoided taking a position on birthright citizenship, though he most likely will have to soon enough, since several powerful GOP members want to end that 14th Amendment right for U.S.-born children of undocumented immigrants.

Many credited Kilroy's victory to Obama's coattails. This year, Kilroy might have won again had Stivers heeded party leaders who asked him to withdraw and run instead for state auditor. Why He's A Rising Star: Stivers has a centrist ideology, humble style and all-American aura. He's known inside the Republican Party as \"Golden Boy.\" He has unique potential to appeal to a diverse swath of voters because of his varied background and tendency to seek the middle ground on some issues. He's a decorated war veteran, former Wall Street trader and financial industry lobbyist (who supports some degree of financial reform). He supports abortion in cases of rape, incest or to save the mother\u2019s life, and during his tenure in the state Senate he backed legislation to freeze tuition at state colleges, allow the disabled to buy into Medicaid, and provide some medical malpractice protections for doctors who treat uninsured patients. Why You Should Care: Like Kinzinger of Illinois, Stivers represents a swing district. Except this one's in Ohio, historically a bellwether for how the nation will vote in a presidential election. In addition, he represents the state\u2019s most populous city. And he already has the ideal profile, solid support base and party backing to become a viable candidate for higher officer sooner rather than later. In a nod to his political potential as well as his financial background, Stivers recently was tapped to serve on the House Financial Services Committee, which regulates Wall Street. It's a plum assignment for a freshman. He'll sit on a panel with jurisdiction over federal monetary policy and the banking system.",

Ouattara said he would move into the palace vacated by the now arrested strongman predecessor, Laurent Gbagbo.\n                \n                    \n                    Philippe Desmazes/AFP/Getty Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption Ivory Coast's President Alassane Ouattara speaks during a press conference last week in Abidjan. Ouattara said he would move into the palace vacated by the now arrested strongman predecessor, Laurent Gbagbo. Simon Akam is Reuters' correspondent in Sierra Leone. When Laurent Gbagbo was dragged out of his hole beneath the presidential residence in Abidjan, Ivory   Coast, wearing a white vest and a bemused expression, it seemed on the surface a fitting end to his country's miserable post-election stalemate. The recalcitrant strongman who would not step down was humbled, but not dead. The Republican Forces rebels, who had been opposing Gbagbo for months, took a live captive, and they denied their vanquished opponents a martyr. Despite Monday's theatrics, however, Alassane Ouattara \u2014 the internationally accepted winner of last year's disputed election and now Ivory Coast's president \u2014 is not yet out of the woods. His situation remains profoundly challenging, even if he is no longer confined to Abidjan's Golf Hotel, where U.N. peacekeepers guarded his parallel headquarters for months during the standoff. Crucially, despite the international consensus that Ouattara won last year's poll, in Ivory Coast itself, the picture has always been different. While to the wider world Gbagbo is irredeemably cast as a petulant refusenik, within the country, his substantial support \u2014 he garnered 46 percent of the vote at November's polls \u2014 persisted throughout the post-election crisis. Thousands of youths in Abidjan answered a call in March to join the army, and support was also sustained by a torrent of propaganda on state media. Indeed, President Ouattara may now find himself with tremendous moral capital abroad \u2014 not withstanding the reported atrocities committed by rebel forces sympathetic to his cause, which must be investigated \u2014 but he faces a much more fractious constituency at home. How he manages the challenges posed by his own people will dictate his future as president \u2014 and the future of his country as it reels from the recent crisis and other, more deeply seated problems. The president's first task in the short term is to splint the divisions that erupted after the election \u2014 an enormous challenge. He must seek to assert his authority, while striving to bring on board those who fought against him. But there is no correct way to proceed in such work; assessments of who to rehabilitate and who to purge are subjective and bound to cause resentment in both camps. For instance, Ouattara was photographed shaking hands with Gbagbo's erstwhile military chief General Philippe Mangou, but if confused reports from Friday prove accurate, he also arrested Charles Ble Goude, the leader of the former president's thuggish Young Patriots militia, which is bound to anger some Gbagbo supporters. What's more, Ouattara will have to contend with allegations of neo-colonialism: the suggestion that the French installed him as a puppet. After all, the French with their helicopters and Licorne force made the capture of Gbagbo feasible (although they claim it was Ivorians themselves who arrested the former president). Ouattara must also put his own house in order. When I met Republican Forces rebels in the far west of Ivory Coast a few weeks ago, shortly before their headlong advance on Abidjan, their commander insisted his men were operating under Ouattara's civilian authority. But how robust the president's control over these fighters was or is remains unclear. That ambiguity is significant because there are credible indications that the rebels committed atrocities, notably in the western town of Duekoue. Ouattara, for his own survival as well as his own personal moral reckoning, needs to show that post-war justice is not of the victor's variety. His weapon of choice in this regard appears to be a Truth and Reconciliation Commission (TRC). South Africa's post-apartheid TRC is the most often cited example of the type of body: Under Archbishop Desmond Tutu's chairmanship, the South African TRC made genuine progress in reconciling the country with its past. But TRCs have their problems, too, often trading immunity from prosecution for a willingness to testify. They can bring inflammatory findings into the public sphere, while allowing their confessed perpetrators to walk free. They can also prove costly and excessively long-lasting, and, to be effective, they require a homegrown bureaucratic establishment that is rare in Africa, including Ivory Coast. As he attempts reconciliation, however, Ouattara has the relative brevity and nature of the conflict on his side. For Ivory Coast's population, the four-month impasse after the election was far too long. Ivorian refugees I interviewed in eastern Liberia recently, men and women who had walked through the bush for days to escape fighting, cared more about peace than politics after their ordeal. But, by the standards of Africa's often-lengthy civil wars, December to April is short, even when viewed in the context of a decade of instability that included a civil war that began in 2002. Moreover, certain parts of what will in all likelihood be known to history as the Second Ivorian Civil War also resembled a Clausewitzean, old-fashioned conflict, rather than the disorganised brigandage that is often the stuff of African fighting. The rebels advanced toward Abidjan, taking and holding territory. There were atrocities, but there was also a front line. There is some chance that such a conflict will prove easier to come to terms with than the internecine slaughter of other sub-Saharan wars. Yet there are deeper challenges, much older than the election crisis, that Ouattara must also grapple with. While from an outside perspective, the Ivorian post-election conflict condensed to a simple morality tale of an elected winner and an immovable loser, internally, the Ouattara-Gbagbo standoff was the small, albeit internationally visible, portion of an iceberg, whose submerged bulk consisted of less easily resolved issues. Most notably, there is the potent concept of \"Ivorite,\"the notion of who is a true Ivorian, which casts the descendants of migrant laborers from other African countries as second-class citizens and has stoked land disputes in the western part of the nation. The most high-profile casualty of the \"Ivorite\" concept was Ouattara himself, once disqualified from running for president on account of his father's Burkinabe (from Burkina Faso) extraction. Then, there is the tension between the Christian south and Muslim north of Ivory Coast. As in much of West Africa, ethnic boundaries run east-west, while national borders, themselves a relic of colonial boundaries, run north-south. Since its 2002 civil war, Ivory Coast has effectively fractured along the latter. Gbagbo drew his support from the south, while Ouattara's powerbase is rooted in the north \u2014 and the division will likely continue, despite Gbagbo's arrest. How will Ouattara do, juggling all of these issues? Only time will tell. Domestic, regional, and personal obstacles \u2014 including the seductive nature of presidential power in Africa \u2014 won't be easy to tackle. Ouattara stands on the high ground now, but he is only at the very beginning of a long and inevitably arduous road. He has won the war; the greater challenge will be for him to win the peace.",

            "article_content": "Remember when Sarah Palin got that stumped look when then-ABC News anchor Charlie Gibson asked her in September 2008 for her view of the Bush doctrine? On Fox News Sunday with host Chris Wallace, Herman Cain, the former head of Godfather's Pizza who's running for the 2012 GOP presidential nomination, got that look, too. It happened during a discussion of the Israeli-Palestinian situation. Wallace asked Cain what his position was on the \"right of return.\" (The exchange starts at 10:05.) WALLACE: Where do you stand on the right of return? CAIN: The right of return? (Pause) The right of return? (Pause) WALLACE: The Palestinian right of return. CAIN: That is something that should be negotiated. That is something that should be negotiated. Pro that he is, Wallace restated the question, spelling out precisely what he was asking to make sure there was no confusion. WALLACE: Do you think the Palestinian refugees, the people who were kicked out of the land in 1948, should be able or should have any right to return to Israeli land? CAIN: Yes. But under \u2014 but not under Palestinian conditions. Yes. They should have a right to come back if that is a decision that Israel wants to make. Back to \u2014 it's up to Israel to determine the things they will accept. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu made it real clear in his statement following the statement that President Obama made. They are wiling to make some concessions. They are willing to give on a lot of things. They are willing to be compassionate. Actually, Netanyahu, like many Israeli Jews, is fairly strongly opposed to the Palestinian \"right of return,\" the idea that those Palestinians who lost their homes in 1948 and during subsequent hostilities could return to their land within Israel's borders as part of an ultimate agreement. It its most expansive version, that would mean nearly five million Palestinian refugees and descendants returning to land within Israel's borders. Because Israel only has a total population of about 7.4 million, the right of return for many Israeli Jews is viewed as an existential threat that would spell the end of the Jewish State. So it's a non-starter. In other words, those millions of Palestinian refugees arguably have about as much chance of taking up residence in the land of their ancestors as Cain has of being president. Even before Cain's stumble, conservative pundit Charles Krauthammer suggested that the former business executive and current radio host's candidacy was really more about entertainment than anything else. Cain seemed out to prove him right.",

Tank shells crashed into residential neighborhoods in the Syrian city of Homs on Wednesday. The country's third-largest city has been a hub of anti-government protests in recent weeks. Abu Omar recently fled Homs to Lebanon. Before the trouble in Syria started, he was a house painter. The country's economy was opening up and people were building. He says his children had free education and free health care. Most people were focused on getting by, he says, not on political reform. Nearly every neighbor had a relative who'd been punished for trying to get involved in politics. \"People disappear \u2014 nobody knows anything about them for 10, 12 years,\" Omar says through an interpreter. \"We used to think about it, but we couldn't do anything about it.\" Then Tunisia overthrew its dictator. Then Egypt. In Syria, some teenagers in the southern city of Daraa sprayed graffiti on walls, calling for the \"doctor\" \u2014 a nickname for Syrian President Bashar Assad \u2014 to go. The teenagers were arrested and allegedly tortured, and the protests spread. Still, Omar stayed home. It wasn't until Syrian tanks and troops entered Daraa and other cities, and hundreds of people started dying, that Omar decided he couldn't take it anymore. Two and half weeks ago, he joined his first Friday protest. Omar says the oppression had become unbearable. \"The entire Syrian people have to rise up, or else there is going to be a genocide,\" he says. After last Friday's protest, tanks started rolling into Omar's city, Homs. He watched from his balcony as tank shells destroyed a shopping center down the street. Forces sealed off all entrances to the city, cut off electricity and shot out water tanks, he says. Families ran out of bread. Then, he says, security forces started going house to house. \"And instead of arresting the men, they decide to start arresting women under 50,\" Omar says. To any Arab man, the implication was clear: We will detain your women and rape them. It was this that finally convinced Omar to pack up the women and children, and leave. Now he and nearly 30 relatives are staying with family in northern Lebanon. Pushing For 'Freedom' Analysts in the region say it's people like Omar who make up the second wave of a revolution. First, it's the activists who organize protests online and use satellite phones and Skype to get the word out. Then, when the regime starts killing, detaining and torturing protesters, it's people like Omar who get radicalized. Omar shows the videos that appeared on his phone during the latest protest. Dead bodies are lying on the ground under tarps. Omar says there's no turning back \u2014 the country is destroyed; the economy is destroyed. They can't stop now, he says. \"Syria is a country of 23 million people,\" he says. \"We're willing to lose 1, 2 more million people. Every father in Syria has about four or five boys that he's willing to send to protest for their freedom.\" Omar says he'd be satisfied if Assad would allow for real elections \u2014 or if Assad just does what Omar calls a courageous thing, and steps down. A Call For Help In recent interviews with The New York Times, Assad's advisers have vowed he'll stay in power. Omar says Assad's regime is wrong to threaten the world that its demise could lead to chaos \u2014 like Iraq after the fall of Saddam Hussein. Omar says it's the regime that is promoting sectarian violence, by pitting pro-regime Alawites, who adhere to an offshoot of Shiite Islam, against anti-regime Sunnis. That violence will only get worse, he says, if Assad hangs onto power. The Obama administration reportedly is considering whether to call for Assad's ouster. Arab countries are said to be divided, and Syria's powerful neighbor, Turkey, has been critical, up to a point. Omar says what Syrian people need right now is help. \"There are ill who are not getting treated. There are pregnant women who are not getting the necessary care. There are children suffering from PTSD, they need some help,\" he says. That help was supposed to come in part from a U.N. aid mission into southern Syria. But so far the convoy has not been allowed into the country.",

Since mid-January, more than 10,000 refugees from countries such as Tunisia and Libya have arrived at the Italian island of Lampedusa. Marine Le Pen, who heads France's far-right National Front Party and is a leading contender in next year's presidential election in France, appeared on the island on Monday to let them know they aren't welcome. Le Pen and other far-right politicians have gained traction recently \u2014 in  large part by raising concerns about immigration.  This has put Europe's leaders into a difficult position. The leaders have expressed support for the democratic aspirations that have led to unrest throughout the Muslim world \u2014 and they don't want to be insensitive to the plight of refugees fleeing repression and violence. On the other hand, they recognize that a flood of refugees would add to prevailing unease about the difficulties of integrating immigrants, especially Muslims. \"While on the one hand, they support the transformation that is now going on in Africa, this short-term anti-immigrant wave that is washing over Europe is so strong,\" says Heather Conley, director of the Europe program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. \"This is about getting to the next election.\" 'Europe Is Being Invaded' In recent years, far-right parties in France, the Netherlands and Sweden have gained traction by complaining that Muslim immigrants are an economic drain and that they don't fit in culturally with the West. According to the Pew Forum on Religion and Public Life, the number of Muslims in Europe jumped from 29.6  million in 1990 to 44.1 million in 2010 \u2014 and are projected to reach 58 million by 2030. More  than half of North Africa's migrants are in Europe, according to the World Bank.  In three European countries \u2014 Belgium, Portugal and France \u2014 more than half the  nation's immigrants from developing countries hail from Africa, according to the  OECD. \"Europe is being invaded,\" Italian Interior Minister Roberto Maroni complained last week, referring to the current exodus from North Africa. Last year, a book by Thilo Sarrazin arguing that immigrants are destroying Germany was an enormous best-seller, triggering a national debate. Both German Chancellor Angela Merkel and, more recently, British Prime Minister David Cameron have said that multiculturalism and immigrant integration have failed in their countries. Meanwhile, Le Pen says that  European navies \"should go as close as possible to  the coasts from where  the clandestine boats departed to send them  back.\" And something like that may be starting to happen. On Tuesday, Italy  refused a ferry carrying 1,800 passengers \u2014 most of them Moroccans who  had fled Libya \u2014 entry into its waters. Skeptics About Assimilation Countries such as Germany actually spend far more than the U.S. government on programs to help immigrants integrate into society, notes Tamar Jacoby, president of ImmigrationWorks USA, a coalition of business groups that rely on immigrant labor. But, Jacoby says, Europeans have a harder time than Americans in believing that immigrants or even their children can assimilate and become true members of their society. \"They don't have the history we have of dealing with it, and hyphenated identities,\" she says. Nations such as the Netherlands and Germany ask questions on their citizenship tests to determine whether immigrants accept homosexuality and gender equality. And many Europeans also are concerned, given pinched finances on the Continent, about whether they can afford to let in more immigrants. Once immigrants arrive, they are often entitled to extensive social benefits. \"Europeans, especially Germans, do feel that they need to be sensitive to refugees,\" says Jacoby, who recently published a Foreign Affairs article about immigration in Germany. \"But [the flow coming up from North Africa] could become too many refugees for many people.\" How The Continent May Respond European Union rules call for refugees to apply for asylum in whichever country they happen to land. That's put a big strain on countries to the south and east. The EU policy is to grant asylum to refugees who  would not be safe in their country of citizenship or residence for fear of  persecution due to their race, religion, nationality, political stances or other  reasons. Not everyone who seeks asylum gets it. There are  judicial hearings, just as in the U.S. The Europeans announced an increase in the aid package to Tunisia to buy the problem away from their shores. Heather Conley, director of the Europe program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies The EU has been talking for a while about developing a  common immigration policy. Some countries are more restrictive than others. Over  the past decade, Germany and other countries have started initiatives designed  to attract high-skilled workers, notably in information technology. In 2007, the  EU created the \"Blue Card,\" which is designed to attract top talent in part by  making it easier for them to move from job to job and country to country. Member  states are supposed to have implementing legislation in place by  June. But the efforts to attract top talent have thus far met with  minimal success. And on the other hand, even before the current influx, Greece was working on a fence to block migrants from coming over from Turkey. Spain and Italy had agreements with African nations to limit immigrant traffic across the Mediterranean. EU nations are channeling aid through organizations, such as the International Organization for Migration, with resources on the ground at places like the Tunisia-Libya border. \"The Europeans announced an increase in the aid package to Tunisia to buy the problem away from their shores,\" says Conley of CSIS. Economic Or Political Refugees? Because the arc stretching across North Africa to Yemen remains far from stable, the relatively small number of refugees seeking safe harbor in Europe is bound to grow. Many of those who have arrived at Lampedusa thus far hail from third countries. Some are workers from places like Bangladesh who had been abandoned by their employers and are seeking any way out. The shape of the refugee debate in Europe may turn largely on the question of whether those coming from North Africa are truly political refugees with reason to fear for their lives, or economic migrants seeking better opportunities. Tunisians have no reason to apply for asylum, says Patrick Weil, a senior research fellow at the Sorbonne. \"People belonging to the former regime are still in power,\" he says. \"I don't see anyone risking their lives for ideas.\" Libyan Refugees: Testing The West But things may be different when it comes to those fleeing Libya, Weil says. If Moammar Gadhafi remains in power, many Libyan refugees will be at risk of execution if they are sent back, and so they will be granted asylum, he predicts. \"As long as it's a humanitarian situation, European populations will be accepting,\" says Elizabeth Collett, European policy fellow with the Migration Policy Institute, a think tank. \"If they think it's economic immigrants taking advantage of the situation, that would be different.\" Political refugees coming from North Africa will present a different profile from that of traditional Muslim immigrants to Europe, says Irene Bloemraad, a sociologist at the University of California, Berkeley. According to a World Bank report, 46.9 percent of immigrants from North Africa and the Middle East in Europe are considered to have \"low skills.\" These new political refugees are more likely to be professional or members of the middle class, Bloemraad says. They also have risked their lives for a widely hailed cause, which will put to the test \"the knee-jerk anti-Muslim reactions that you've seen over the last 10 years,\" she adds. \"The people in Libya are embracing what the West sees as their values \u2014 democracy and lack of repression,\" she says. \"Making the Muslim 'alien' is going to be much more difficult.\"",

The president recently came under fire for inviting Common to perform at the White House's poetry night.\n                \n                    \n                    J.D. Pooley/Getty Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption Rapper Common performs at President Barack Obama's 'Moving America Forward' Rally October 31, 2010 in Cleveland, Ohio. The president recently came under fire for inviting Common to perform at the White House's poetry night. John McWhorter is a contributing editor at The New  Republic. Watching Republicans clutching their pearls to see the rapper Common invited to the White House on a poetry night Wednesday has revealed a party whose stars are grievously out of touch with the culture they hope to lead, as well as to culture in general, apparently. It is understandable that some would imagine if the Obamas convene a poetry night, the invitees would be the likes of Billy Collins or Elizabeth Alexander, who read a poem at the President's inauguration. But this is 2011, in which in terms of people about 50 and younger, the idea of poetry as only, or even mainly, writerly observations on the printed page is about as current as the idea that a newspaper is a physical object. Although not all process it quite this way, poetry now occupies a more central place in the lives of typical young Americans of all colors than it ever has in the history of the nation \u2014 as rap music. The only question would be why the Obamas, as today's Kennedys, would not include a rapper on their list. Anyone who can see nothing valid in rap reaching the White House hasn't listened to much rap since about \u2014 well, in Sarah Palin's case, apparently 1979. Helpfully letting us know that her problem with Wednesday's White House event was not based on being \"anti-rap,\" Palin told us that she knows the words to that year's \"Rapper's Delight,\" the hit that created a new musical era. Indeed, those lyrics were cute, but hardly something one would expect the First Couple to be musing upon after dinner. Rap lyrics have gone much further and deeper than that over the past three decades, and even the days when the nasty \"gangsta\" variety was the hottest thing are now past. Rap is in a refractive, self-reflexive phase in which the major players, such as Kanye West and Lil Wayne, are more about how interesting they find themselves than about shooting cops. Furthermore, one could almost have predicted that the invited representative would be Common. He is one of the foundational \"conscious\" rappers who has eschewed the \"gangsta\" routine, even including his father on one recording (Be) advising us to \"be a brilliant soul, sparkling in the galaxy while walking on earth.\" But to Palin, Karl Rove and their ilk, Common is just one more exhibitionist polluting the culture with a thug routine, as if 50 Cent were invited to regale the Obamas with strophes about \"gats.\" One could only take this view of Common with a willful blindness to context and nuance. Big surprise: Dig around in Common's oeuvre and you find that \u2014 get this \u2014 this black leftist bard of the black condition turns out to have some tribal affection for Black Panther sorts, despite their less-than-pristine criminal records. The Republicans' problem this time is Common's passing shout-out to Joanne Chesimard, an ex-Panther who was convicted of killing a New Jersey officer in a shoot-out and has long been under political asylum in Cuba. But this hardly means Common would warmly advise a young man to go assassinate some more cops, or that he applauds to hear of cops dying today. Adulation of the Panthers is hardly ideal, to be sure, based more on drama than action. But if it's wrong for the Obamas to have anyone over who sees a certain revolutionary heroism in the Black Panthers as people battling the more overt racism and police brutality of that historical period, then this would disqualify probably every second black writer or thinker in the United States, not to mention legions of ordinary citizens with Huey Newton T-shirts. Interesting: I presume Rove and Palin roll their eyes at those who see racism in Southerners celebrating their Civil War military heroes. We are to be \"mature,\" stop being so hasty and reductionist, and understand that one can cheer for Jefferson Davis and Robert E. Lee without being a racist. Okay \u2014 but then, we will not, either, condemn black people with a passing fellow-traveler feeling for the Panthers as advocates of murder. Or, it turns out Common said \"burn a Bush\" in one lyric. Again, who's being immature and hasty here? Not so long ago, we were to stop bashing Palin for the likes of \"Don't retreat, reload.\" I agreed \u2014 to link this kind of language to the Tucson disaster meant being studiously deaf to how metaphor pervades all human expression; no one would have batted an eye if Barbara Jordan had said the exact same thing. Well, now a rapper says \"burn a Bush\" and he shouldn't be allowed on 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue? Please: This suggests a numbness to the basic abstractness of human expression, or at least a rather pathetic inattention. Of course, while Common is a poet worthy of the White House, he's no political leader, and thus the sourest note about the whole fracas is that it has stirred up something that Obama's election quietly tamped down. Not so long ago, quite a few harbored a melodramatic notion that \"conscious\" rap was going to undergird some kind of \"hip-hop revolution.\" That idea was always a distraction from real politics, which are something quite different from the earnest but idle cynicism set to rhymes over beats. Immediately after Obama's election, this trope lost its mojo. I suspect that the election of a black president looked so revolutionary in itself, and was ineluctably real in comparison to the fantastical \"hip hop generation\" vision. At the Obamas' poetry night, rap was treated, in a high-profile venue, for what it is. That is, not something that is going to turn the Capitol upside down, but poetry \u2014 like Jay-Z's work now sold between covers. But the scenario is ruined when we have people of a different brand of recreational opposition protesting on the sidelines as if the Obamas having Common over were like inviting Young Jeezy or Cam'ron. Because Common now has a guru status complete with a burgeoning career in film, the criticism will come off to a healthy contingent as a knock on one of the bards of black dignity \u2014 i.e. as more evidence that Republicans are racists just as the debate over racism in the Tea Party has retreated. Moreover, it will revive the eagerness of that same contingent to fill us in on the fact that \"All rap isn't like that!\" The implication traditionally associated with this observation is that the rap not \"like that\" is our new Freedom Songs. But it never has been, and we've seen blissfully little of the pretense over the past two and a half years. It's a shame, then, that the cotton-headed artistic sensibility of the Republicans' poster people will pump new life into a routine with such a vast disproportion of heat to light.",

Coming up, we will tell you about Africa's newest country starting tomorrow, South Sudan. The celebrations there are getting under way, but the elation is tempered by some sobering challenges that the new country faces. We'll hear from NPR's Ofeibea Quist-Arcton, who is there, and from special correspondent Rebecca Hamilton, who just spent most of the last year there. That conversation is coming up. But first, we want to talk about some very pressing issues here at home. Like many people, we've been following the negotiations over how to reduce federal spending and most important, the budget deficit. Congressional Republicans have tied those conversations to a vote on whether to increase the nation's debt ceiling. President Obama will meet again on Sunday with congressional leaders trying to come up with a compromise. The administration says that without a deal by August 2nd, the U.S. could start defaulting on this debt. And that could have a terrible effect on the economy. Meanwhile, in Minnesota, there's a similar situation on a smaller scale. There's still no deal between the Democratic governor and the Republican legislature, eight days past a constitutional deadline that has forced much of the state government to shut down. Twenty-two thousand employees have been told to stay home as the two sides wrestle over how to resolve a $5 billion deficit. We wanted to talk more about this situation and how it's affecting people in Minnesota, so we're joined by Catharine Richert. She's a political reporter for Minnesota public radio who's been writing for MPR's Shutdown 2011 blog. Also with us, Trixie Ann Golberg, president of Life Track Resource. That's a nonprofit that provides services for immigrants, refugees, and people with disabilities - and they've been affected by the shutdown. Thank you both so much for joining us. CATHARINE RICHERT: Thank you. TRIXIE ANN GOLBERG: Thank you. MARTIN: Catharine, I'm going to start with you. How did it get to this point? RICHERT: Well, the big issue here is that Governor Dayton would like to increase taxes on Minnesota's wealthiest. At this point, he's proposing an income tax increase on those making more than a million dollars. Republicans, on the other hand, are interested in cutting spending, and so that's really the rub here - increasing taxes or cutting spending. And that's where we left things at midnight on June 30th, when our fiscal year ended. MARTIN: Were people surprised that it got to this point? Has this ever happened before in this state? RICHERT: Well, we had a partial government shutdown back in 2005 but, you know, I would say that the rub between the Democrats and Republicans in our capital has been going on, really, since the beginning of the year, when Governor Dayton took office. So I think we've been hearing a lot of the same arguments happening over the last, you know, six months. MARTIN: So, what aspects of government service have been most affected or, I mean, I'm assuming that law enforcement is still on the job. What are some of the things that are affected? RICHERT: Sure. So yeah, you're right, you know, anything that sort of affects life and property and protection are still in place. So that means cops, 911 dispatchers, they're still on the job. But it's a lot of other things that you might not think of immediately. For instance, all of our state parks are closed. And I can tell you that Minnesotans love to spend time outside in the summer. They hunt, they fish, they get out on their boat on our lakes. And when you shut the state parks down, especially over the Fourth of July weekends, you know, people get frustrated. We're also not doing any road construction. We have a lot of potholes in Minnesota that are not being filled right now, a lot of highways that aren't being widened. So the scope is pretty broad, I would say. MARTIN: So Trixie - and your organization is a nonprofit. You're not a government agency per se, but you've still been tremendously affected by this shutdown. Tell us how. GOLBERG: Yes, that's correct. Twenty-eight percent of our revenue actually comes through the state in one form or another - either a direct allocation, or it's federal dollars that have to go through some kind of authorization process, or it's county dollars that are caught up in a state-approval process. So we're impacted both by the lack of funding and the lack of authorization to carry out our work. MARTIN: Well, can you give us an example of some of the programs that have been affected? GOLBERG: Certainly. Our services that we provide to federally designated refugees and legal immigrants has been on shutdown for the last eight days. We provide support to individuals with significant disabilities, including a serious mental illness. We provide support to families who have children who are diagnosed with hearing loss. MARTIN: So meaning what? That people can't get - if there are social workers who are set to visit these families to offer support, they can't go? Can you give us some specific examples of some of the things that might happen? GOLBERG: Absolutely. It is the human resources that are no longer available to them, as well as the financial support and training support and job supports that these programs provide. For instance, in our services supporting refugees and immigrants, we provide support for job search, job placement, relocation. Many of our refugees have extremely limited English language skills and are in need of translation services. They are in need of support in meeting their basic needs such as transportation, housing, enrolling their children in school - all those supports that go along with helping them to create a firm and solid foundation. MARTIN: So for example, someone who is a legal immigrant, or perhaps a political asylum seeker. GOLBERG: Mm-hmm. MARTIN: Someone who's just here from - let's say Iraq, OK. And you're helping this family resettle, enroll in school. None of that can proceed right now because none of the people who do those services are being paid, and so you have to what? So they're all laid off? GOLBERG: Correct. We had to lay off approximately a third of our employees. And so on June 30th, we were contacting each of our 700-some open cases, letting them know that their support person, their job counselor would not be available during the shutdown. We tried to reassure them as much as possible. And again, doing things - translating to a different language is challenging, as you can imagine. And for many of our refugees and legal immigrants, their own experiences of what a government shutdown is, and entails - it's quite confusing to understand the political nature of Minnesota's government shutdown. MARTIN: If you're just joining us, you're listening to TELL ME MORE from NPR News. We're talking about the shutdown of the Minnesota state government, and we're talking about how it's affecting different people. With us are Trixie Ann Golberg. That's who was speaking just now. She's president of Life Track Resource. That's a nonprofit human services organization. Also with us, Catharine Richert. She's a political reporter and blogger for Minnesota Public Radio. Catharine, we've been hearing that the shutdown is actually costing the state money. How is that? RICHERT: Sure. So, you know, I go back to the Department of Natural Resources. By shutting down the state parks, we're estimating about $1 million lost in revenue every week from camping fees, hunting, you know, licensing fees, that sort of thing. We're also looking at the state lottery being shut down, and that's costing the state about 2.3 million every week. So the list goes on and on. There's lost money due to loss of productivity - you know, organizations that have been sort of spending weeks prepping for this and not doing their actual, you know, regular jobs. So, you know, I think we probably won't get that final number until after this is all over. But certainly, it's a lot of money. MARTIN: How was it determined which services would be offered, and which ones would not? I mean, because - and there have been a couple of occasions when the federal government has shut down. And there are people who are considered essential, and they stay on the job. And the people who are considered... RICHERT: Sure. MARTIN: ...non-essential, which I'm sure doesn't feel very good but is the term that's used, don't - how was it determined in Minnesota, for example? What was essential and what was not? I'm thinking about something like child-care subsidies, I mean, without child-care subsidies... RICHERT: Sure, so... MARTIN: ...people can't work. So even if they could go to work, they can't go to work. How is that determined, do... RICHERT: Right. So I'll try to keep it as simple as possible. But the long story short is that the governor and his administration, as well as our attorney general, went to a judge and said, this is what we think should stay open. And they gave this judge their list. But ultimately, those decisions rest with our courts in Minnesota. So a woman named Judge Kathleen Gearin has been the person making these decisions. She has also appointed someone, called a special master. And this is someone who hears testimony, I guess, from organizations like Trixie's, who say, hey, you know, we're not state employees, but we provide critical services. And we think we should still get state funding throughout the government shutdown. So that's the process we've been in right now. We're hearing new rulings every day about things that were deemed not essential and suddenly are. And one of those things is child-care support from the state. Now initially, child-care support had been deemed non-critical, and that happened last Wednesday, on the 29th. However, since then, Governor Dayton has gone back to the courts and said hey, we really think this money should be considered a core government function. These are essentially state subsidies that help parents send their kids to child care so they can keep a job, you know? MARTIN: I understand. We only have a couple minutes left. I wanted ask one more thing of each of you. Catharine, we've seen, over the course of the year, some very intense battles over the budget along philosophical, ideological and partisan lines. We've seen this in Wisconsin, for example, over the question of revoking collective bargaining rights where, you know, the Democrats in the legislature runs one side, and that's - the governor and Republicans on the legislature were on a different side. And of course in Washington, there's a partisan and philosophical divide over reducing the budget deficit. So that's the substance of it. How are the politics playing out? And there's a Democratic governor - he was elected; obviously, feels that he has a mandate for his point of view. You've got a Republican legislature. They were elected. They feel they have a mandate for their point of view. How are the politics shaking out right now? Can you sense where the public is on this, and who they think is right? RICHERT: Yeah, you know, I mean, I would say that the last election was really close. I mean, we had another recount when Governor Dayton was elected. I think that speaks to the fact that Minnesotans are divided over these issues. And what we've been hearing are lots of finger pointing. You know, some people think it's the Republicans that are to blame for this. Some people think it's Governor Dayton to blame. But I would say the thing that unites Minnesotans over this is that they are frustrated about this. No one is happy about it. We've had a lot of people write in and say hey, we're voting for independents - candidates in the next time around. You know, so I would say that this will certainly be part of our 2012 elections. MARTIN: And Trixie Ann, finally, before we let you go, you mentioned that many of the people that you and your agency works with are new to this country and don't understand what's going on. How do you explain it to them? GOLBERG: Well, we've tried to translate it as best as we can. There was actually serious concern that electricity would be turned off, water would be turned off. And again, in their life experience, those were realities. So working with them through our trained staff, through our translators as we had them available, to provide information with them directly, to translate. And we can continue to provide kind of a support service at our office, in a community center, where individuals and displaced clients can work with individuals to help them navigate. Our United Way has come together to support our 211 information resource. So we're attempting to connect people with good information and resources as best we can. MARTIN: Trixie Ann Golberg is president of Lifetrack Resource. That's a nonprofit which provides services for immigrants, refugees, and people with significant disabilities. She came to us thanks to American Public Media's Public Insight Network. She was with us from Minnesota Public Radio in St. Paul, along with Catharine Richert. She's a political reporter from Minnesota Public Radio. She's been writing about the events for MPR Shutdown 2011 blog. Ladies, thank you both so much for joining us. RICHERT: Thanks for having us.

            "article_content": "As NPR's Scott Horsley reported for Morning Edition: \"President Obama will try Tuesday to follow in the footsteps of Teddy  Roosevelt when he delivers an economic speech in Osawatomie, Kan., the same city  where Roosevelt issued a famous call for a 'New Nationalism' more than 100 years  ago. \"For Obama, this is a 'connect-the-dots' speech. White House spokesman Jay  Carney said it's a chance to show how the president's various economic proposals  \u2014 from stricter banking oversight to payroll tax cuts \u2014 fit together, as Obama  prepares for a re-election battle.\" Roosevelt's speech \u2014 delivered after he had left the White House and as he was beginning a bid to return there on the Bull Moose Party ticket (he didn't succeed) \u2014 has become known for his words about \"the square deal.\" Theodore Roosevelt, twenty-sixth president of the United States serving from 1901 to 1909.\n                \n                    \n                    National Archives/Getty Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption Theodore Roosevelt, twenty-sixth president of the United States serving from 1901 to 1909. \"I stand for the square deal,\" Roosevelt said. \"But when I say that I am for the square deal, I  mean not merely that I stand for fair play under the present rules of the game,  but that I stand for having those rules changed so as to work for a more  substantial equality of opportunity and of reward for equally good service. One  word of warning, which, I think, is hardly necessary in Kansas. When I say I  want a square deal for the poor man, I do not mean that I want a square deal for  the man who remains poor because he has not got the energy to work for himself.  If a man who has had a chance will not make good, then he has got to quit.\" The former president was speaking, according to the Theodore Roosevelt Center at Dickinson State University, at a memorial ceremony for abolitionist John Brown. Many Civil War veterans were among the 30,000 or so people there. As the center says, the address was \"the most important speech\" of Roosevelt's political career, according to historian Kathleen Dalton. Roosevelt, the center writes, \"proclaimed himself for workman's compensation, labor laws to protect women and  children, a graduated income tax and an inheritance tax. It put some of his most  radical ideas out into the world for all to hear and changed the course of  American political history.\" The full text of Roosevelt's words is posted here. We don't want to assign homework, but thought some Two-Way readers might want to see it before Obama's scheduled 2 p.m. ET address. (Correction at 11:30 a.m. ET: earlier, we said the address was set for 1 p.m. ET.) Here are a few more excerpts from Roosevelt's speech. In some ways, his words have been echoed by many Occupy Wall Street protesters: -- \"In every wise struggle for human betterment one of the main objects, and  often the only object, has been to achieve in large measure equality of  opportunity. In the struggle for this great end, nations rise from barbarism to  civilization, and through it people press forward from one stage of  enlightenment to the next. One of the chief factors in progress is the  destruction of special privilege. The essence of any struggle for healthy  liberty has always been, and must always be, to take from some one man or class  of men the right to enjoy power, or wealth, or position, or immunity, which has  not been earned by service to his or their fellows. That is what you fought for  in the Civil War, and that is what we strive for now.\" -- \"Our government, National and State, must be freed from the sinister influence or  control of special interests. Exactly as the special interests of cotton and  slavery threatened our political integrity before the Civil War, so now the  great special business interests too often control and corrupt the men and  methods of government for their own profit. We must drive the special interests  out of politics.\" -- \"The true friend of property, the true conservative, is he who insists that  property shall be the servant and not the master of the commonwealth; who  insists that the creature of man's making shall be the servant and not the  master of the man who made it. The citizens of the United States must  effectively control the mighty commercial forces which they have called into  being.\" -- \"The absence of effective State, and, especially, national, restraint upon unfair  money-getting has tended to create a small class of enormously wealthy and  economically powerful men, whose chief object is to hold and increase their  power. The prime need to is to change the conditions which enable these men to  accumulate power which it is not for the general welfare that they should hold  or exercise. We grudge no man a fortune which represents his own power and  sagacity, when exercised with entire regard to the welfare of his fellows.  Again, comrades over there, take the lesson from your own experience. Not only  did you not grudge, but you gloried in the promotion of the great generals who  gained their promotion by leading their army to victory. So it is with us. We  grudge no man a fortune in civil life if it is honorably obtained and well used.  It is not even enough that it should have been gained without doing damage to  the community. We should permit it to be gained only so long as the gaining  represents benefit to the community.\" -- \"The fundamental thing to do for every man is to give him a chance to reach a  place in which he will make the greatest possible contribution to the public  welfare. Understand what I say there. Give him a chance, not push him up if he  will not be pushed. Help any man who stumbles; if he lies down, it is a poor job  to try to carry him; but if he is a worthy man, try your best to see that he  gets a chance to show the worth that is in him.\" -- \"I do not ask for the over centralization; but I do ask that we work in a  spirit of broad and far-reaching nationalism where we work for what concerns our  people as a whole. We are all Americans. Our common interests are as broad as  the continent. I speak to you here in Kansas exactly as I would speak in New  York or Georgia, for the most vital problems are those which affect us all  alike. The National Government belongs to the whole American people, and where  the whole American people are interested, that interest can be guarded  effectively only by the National Government. The betterment which we seek must  be accomplished, I believe, mainly through the National Government.\" -- \"The American people are right in demanding that New Nationalism, without which  we cannot hope to deal with new problems. The New Nationalism puts the national  need before sectional or personal advantage.\" Update at 3 p.m. ET. Obama's Speech: We've added a separate post wrapping up the president's speech.",

President Obama will try Tuesday to follow in the footsteps of Teddy Roosevelt when he delivers an economic speech in Osawatomie, Kan., the same city where Roosevelt issued a famous call for a \"New Nationalism\" more than 100 years ago. For Obama, this is a \"connect-the-dots\" speech. White House spokesman Jay Carney said it's a chance to show how the president's various economic proposals \u2014 from stricter banking oversight to payroll tax cuts \u2014 fit together, as Obama prepares for a re-election battle. \"He thinks it's an opportune time and an opportune location to try to put into broader perspective the kind of debates we've been having and the issues that are of vital importance to give middle-class Americans the kind of fair shot that they deserve,\" he said. In recent days, Obama has tested some of the central themes of the speech, about building an economy that works for everyone. \"You guys know that what America is about is that we're all in this together; that each of us has to do our own individual part, but we also have to be looking out for one another,\" he said last week in Scranton,  Pa. Unlike Pennsylvania, Kansas, is solidly Republican territory. But the White House had a reason for choosing Osawatomie.  Obama is deliberately seeking comparisons to a speech Roosevelt gave there 101 years ago. \"President Obama seems to look at history as something that can teach the present,\" said H.W. Brands of the University of Texas, one of a number of historians who've consulted with the president on multiple occasions. \"I'm sure he would not be so naive as to think that history predicts the present.  But to some extent it frames the range of the possible.\" President Obama seems to look at history as something that can teach the present. I'm sure he would not be so naive as to think that history predicts the present. But to some extent it frames the range of the possible. H.W. Brands, University of Texas Brands is the author of a Roosevelt biography called T.R.-- The Last Romantic. Roosevelt used his speech to call for a more activist federal government, including thorough policing of the financial system and a graduated tax on high incomes. And just as Roosevelt defended himself against accusations of communism by quoting Abraham Lincoln, Brands said Obama hopes to fend off charges of class warfare by presenting himself as the heir to Republican Roosevelt. \"One of the ways of deflecting criticism is to put your own positions in the mouths of great figures from the past,\" he said. \"And for Obama, one of the great appeals of Theodore Roosevelt is he's a recognizable name brand. He's valued by both parties, even though a lot of what Roosevelt stood for has largely been forgotten.\" The memorable phrase from Roosevelt's speech is \"a square deal,\" which includes widespread opportunity and a distribution of wealth that benefits the whole community. Obama sounded a similar note last week in Scranton. \"We believe that if the folks at the bottom and the folks in the middle succeed, then American succeeds, and the folks at the top succeed as well,\" he said. Recently, the Occupy Wall Street movement has shone a spotlight on America's skewed distribution of income. But Obama was talking about these ideas long before that. In early 2008, then-candidate Obama said the economy is strongest when the middle class grows and opportunity is widely spread. \"When it's not, when opportunity is uneven or unequal, it is our responsibility to restore balance, and fairness, and keep that promise alive for the next generation,\" he said. What role government should play in keeping that promise is likely to be at the center of next year's presidential campaign. Brands said Roosevelt's call for a \"New Nationalism\" found widespread acceptance a century ago, though Roosevelt himself wound up losing in a three-way race to Woodrow Wilson. \"They split the vote between Roosevelt, who at that time was the Progressive, not the Republican nominee, and Woodrow Wilson, the Democratic nominee.  Together they got a very large majority of the vote,\" he said. \"Roosevelt didn't win. Wilson did.  But progressivism as a whole was the major victor.\" Obama hopes the progressive ideas he's talking about will prevail again 2012.",

Arm Thyself Against the Foreigners and Anarchists!\" OK. So you can't quite picture it. No sweat. It's the surrealistic setting of Bioshock: Infinite, a video game \u2014 sequel to the critically acclaimed Bioshock \u2014 scheduled for release from Irrational Games in 2012. The storyline is imaginative, assimilating eclectic influences. But one salient characteristic is unmistakable: The pro-Uncle Sam, protectionist feel of the game reflects the mood of many present-day American nationalists. \"The nationalism thrown throughout this is so overt,\" says video game critic Hilary Goldstein in a preview trailer. Nationalism can contribute to human progress and freedom and education and economic vitality, or it can contribute to violence, fear, and international conflicts. Lloyd Kramer You don't need to fire up the Xbox 360 to know that there has been among many Americans a swell of nationalism in the years following the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks. \u2022 Go to a baseball game where fans often croon \"God Bless America\" during the seventh-inning stretch. \u2022 Check out the American flag pins on the lapels or collars of nearly every politician. \u2022 Listen to Toby Keith's current hit Made in America and read how it inspired a Michigan kindergarten class to create an \"American-made show-and-tell.\" Call it what you will \u2014 American nationalism or patriotism \u2014 it is covering the country like a Wi-Fi cloud \u2014 above the fruited plain from sea to shining sea. Where does this rising nationalism spring from? And is it a positive or a negative trait for a country? That all depends ... A Sense of Selfhood Nationalism flows through our lives every day, observes Lloyd Kramer, author of the recent book Nationalism in Europe and America. And, like most \"isms,\" Kramer says, nationalism carries with it both good and bad characteristics.    \"When people feel committed to larger communities or interests or to ideas of human rights and political progress, for example, nationalism can contribute to a sense of hope about the future.  It can build positive personal and collective identities and a sense of selfhood in the modern world \" Festival-goer Josh Bleeker waits for the first act on the main stage at the Stagecoach Country Music Festival, April 30 in Indio, Calif.\n                \n                    \n                    Robyn Beck/AFP/Getty Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption On the other hand, he says, \"nationalism often encourages fears of all kinds of other people:  fears of other religions or races or cultures or ethnic groups or homosexuals.  This fear can be mobilized for violence and scapegoating.   It can lead people to feel aggrieved and constantly at risk.\" In various ways, he adds, \"nationalism can contribute to human progress and freedom and education and economic vitality, or it can contribute to violence, fear and international conflicts.\" Nationalism, according to Kramer, is often in full flower on national holidays, during major sports events and at public memorials for deceased military troops.  And nationalistic symbols, rituals and rhetoric are especially ramped up as the country moves toward a presidential election. A Political Tool? He's not kidding. Patriotism permeates contemporary American politics. As do accusations of unpatriotic behavior. Of course, the word \"patriot\" is a subjective characterization, and most politicians use it as code for someone who shares their beliefs. Americans \"are a patriotic people,\" said Mitt Romney at the recent Republican presidential debate in Orlando. \"We place our hand over our heart during the playing of the national anthem. No other people on Earth do that.\" So does that mean that people who don't place their hands over their hearts while the anthem is played are not patriots? Speaking to a Tea Party gathering in New   Hampshire on Labor Day weekend, possible presidential candidate Sarah Palin said, \"We patriots should not focus on petty political squabbles and media game sound bites. The Tea Party has got to be focused on the broader, much more important goals of this movement \u2014 replace Obama.\" Does that mean that someone who supports the president of the United States is not a patriot? From the Democratic angle, Texas Rep. Sheila Jackson Lee, speaking recently on the Tavis Smiley Show, suggested that members of the Tea Party should \"stop being Tea Party people instead of patriots and Americans.\" Does that mean a Tea Partier cannot also be a patriot and an American? And Rick Perry in a new Web ad intones, \"We don't need a president who apologizes for America. I believe in America. I believe in her purpose and her promise. ... God bless the United States of America.\" Though the United States may have its own brand  of nationalism, most countries have a strong streak of patriotic  pride. There are times when nationalism becomes more prominent  on a global scale and other periods when it is displaced by other issues, says  Peter Rutland, who writes the NationalismWatch blog. The last big wave was the  post-Communist 1990s, when Yugoslavia became a handful of  republics. Now we are experiencing another wave, Rutland says. \"The economic  rise of the BRICs [Brazil,  Russia, India and China] and other middle-income countries is often  accompanied by nationalist assertion, China being the obvious case, also Turkey  and many others.\" Increased globalization, he adds, \"produces a  countereffect of increased national assertion, worries about the loss of  identity. Then we see a new wave of democratization \u2014 starting with the color  revolutions in the former Soviet Union and now  the Arab spring.\" He cites the book From Voting to Violence by Jack Snyder,  which shows that democratization often leads \"to an uptick on nationalist  politics as media and political parties use nationalism as an organizing  principle for the new political situation.\" The Arab spring, for example, is leading to more  nationalist rhetoric and possibly policy changes to follow in places like  Egypt, he says. And \"Turkey  shows that Islamism and nationalism can go  together.\"  -- Linton Weeks After watching that ad, CNN's Carol Costello asked: \"Should patriotism be a political tool?\" She then pointed out that \"patriotism has worked for Democrats, too, during the 2008 campaign. Vice presidential candidate Joe Biden said wealthy Americans should pay more taxes because it's time to be patriotic.\" The Patriotic Center Patriotism, nationalism. Is there a difference? Peter Rutland, a professor of government at Wesleyan University in Middletown, Conn., says that in the U.S., the word \"nationalism\" often has negative connotations. \"So we talk instead about patriotism.\" He says,  \"Other people are nationalists; we are patriots.\" But for the sake of argument, the terms \"nationalism\" and \"patriotism\" are pretty much interchangeable, Rutland says. He studies this instinct on a global level and posts observations on his NationalismWatch blog. Rutland, Kramer and others who track nationalism point out that U.S. nationalism has swelled since 2001. Countrywide concerns about a faltering economy and a flood of immigration only intensify the notion of nationalism. Both liberal and conservative politicians have been adapting their language, Rutland says, \"to try to appeal to the patriotic median voter.\" Rutland says that in light of that quest for the patriotic center, Obama's language has been particularly striking. \"If you read his speech announcing his candidacy in Springfield, Ill., or his inaugural address, you see a heavy emphasis on the common national narrative \u2014 the sacrifices of Gettysburg, the legacy of past generations, etc. \u2014 classic nationalist/patriotic imagery.\" Shovels To Snowshoes That nod toward nationalism served Obama well in the 2008 election. It has also worked for a number of business people,  such as Todd Lipscomb. Not too long ago, Lipscomb was an executive in a California tech company. He lived in and traveled through Asia and the Pacific Rim for seven years. As his American company's global business increased, Lipscomb began to worry about the folks \u2014 their jobs and financial futures \u2014 back in the U.S. Four years ago, he resigned from his company, moved home to California and launched the website Made in USA Forever.  He sells products \u2014 everything from shovels to snowshoes \u2014 that are domestically manufactured. \"Stand with us to protect America's ability to produce, create jobs, and remain a world leader,\" the website intones. From his home in San   Clemente, Lipscomb says \"sales are surging. Conversely to the economic trends, the bad news has energized my customer base.\" Customers know \"they are doing something real for our economy,\" Lipscomb says. \"Every item is made here from U.S.A. components, so from the farmer that grows the cotton through every step of the way it helps our economy and creates jobs in a virtuous circle.\" There are many similar sites for domestically manufactured products, including Made in USA and the Made in America store. Lipscomb's website offers more than 2,800 products from over 480 \"mostly small, family-owned business,\" Lipscomb says. But he adds, \"Where we are weak is in electronics.\" Lipscomb has written a couple of books about his experience, including Re-Made in America: How We Can Restore Jobs, Retool Manufacturing and Compete with the World. The issue of nationalism or patriotism is not a partisan concern, he says. He has been asked to appear on Ed Shultz's progressive radio show as well as the conservative Fox & Friends national TV program. He says his website attracts people of all stripes. \"Conservatives, progressives, outdoorsmen, union members, immigrants, and many, many other groups come together on the website as Americans.\" In the end, he says, \"this is not a red state or blue state issue, but truly a red, white and blue one.\"",

Putin, as his image makers have incessantly reminded since their man scaled the Kremlin heights eleven years ago, is an ardent sportsman with a black belt in judo. The mostly-male throng at the \"no rules\" fight was supposed to be his kind of he-man crowd \u2014 and until now, it has been. The possible downfall of the autocratic Putin \u2014 now prime minister, with plans to return to the presidency in elections in March \u2014 might look like an opening for the forces of liberalism in Russia. Putin, after all, is their bete noire \u2014 and it is the liberals, more than any other faction in Russia, who have steadfastly and courageously, at cost to their lives, pointed out the endemic corruption and the abuses of power at the core of his rotten regime. The crowds now chanting \"Putin is a thief!\" are echoing a staple liberal refrain. But a post-Putin era is unlikely to be a liberal one. Russian liberalism \u2014 which identifies itself with Western-style democracy \u2014 has a tepid mass following, its ranks consistently overestimated over the last twenty years by ever-hopeful Western governments, analysts, and journalists. And the current groundswell of protest, while promising on the surface, looks more like a popular rejection of a strongman who has overstayed his welcome \u2014 not like a rejection of the model of strongman rule. IN THE MOST RECENT parliamentary elections, in which Putin's United Russia party snagged a woeful (though still largest) share of about half the vote, the liberal Yabloko party just managed to crack 3 percent. (The Communists, in second place, got about 19 percent.) Yes, the election was something less than \"free and fair\" and yes, Team Putin, since 2000, has routinely stigmatized Yabloko as a foreign, anti-Russian presence. But even at the peak of its influence, in the early 1990s, just after the crack-up of the Soviet Union, Yabloko never got more than 8 percent of the vote. Meanwhile, the ascendant force in Russia is a decidedly illiberal nationalism \u2014 uglier, in fact, than anything Putin himself has offered. The most popular political slogan in the nation is the noxious \"Russia for the Russians\" \u2014 backed by some 60 percent of citizens in opinion polls. The resentment behind that slogan is directed at non-ethnic Russians from the Caucasus region of Russia and at dark-skinned immigrants from former Soviet Republics, particularly in Central Asia. Such peoples are blamed for crime, for breeding too fast (relative to ethnic Russians), for much that ails a stagnant, unhappy society. There are many reasons why liberalism is weak in Russia. One is that Western-oriented Russian liberals have a tortured relationship with the country's \"ordinary\" people. This is an old story with a lineage dating to pre-Soviet, Czarist times. The main idea, from the liberals' (always exasperated) point of view, is that the typical Russian, a bumpkin, is unable to grasp the blessings of progress and a progressive society. \"It is common knowledge that the Russian people are irrational by nature,\" the Russian journalist Anna Politkovskaya wrote in 2002 in the Los Angeles Times. \"The majority of them do not require candidates running for offices to provide clear-cut economic programs. In fact, the people are even slightly irritated, as opinion polls show, when a candidate is too intelligent \u2014 or at least more intelligent than the mass. At the same time, Russian people love macho \u2014 they love brutality, demonstrations of strong-handed policies and tough moves made for show.\" This is the same journalist, an impeccable liberal who hated Putin and Putin's war in Chechnya with a passion and was not afraid to say so, who was murdered in Moscow in 2006 on October 7, the day of Putin's birthday \u2014 a crime that Putin's critics blame on his regime. The ordinary Russian is sufficiently astute to apprehend liberal condescension. Mistrust of Western-style liberalism is fed, too, by the Russian Orthodox Church, which has traditionally viewed autocracy as necessary to keep order in Mother Russia. The result tends to be parallel worlds in which the liberal elite and \"the people\" fail to connect. Liberals hunker down in \"civilized\" Moscow and St.   Petersburg and, as in past times, many choose to emigrate to the democratic West. In the recent parliamentary elections, Yabloko got the largest share of the vote among Russian expatriate citizens voting in the U.S., France, and the U.K. (41 percent in Britain, about four times the number recorded for Putin's party). At the same time, Russian liberalism has failed to produce convincing leaders. Even supporters tend to view Yabloko's longtime leader, Grigory Yavlinsky, as flawed by a Hamlet-like indecisive streak. Boris Yeltsin? A former Communist Party boss, he did not spring from the soil of Russian liberalism. And while he did jerk Russia into the possibility of a democratic future with his heroic insistence on the break-up of the Soviet Union, his presidency devolved into the rule of a Czar Boris who imperiously changed prime ministers on a whim and made corrupt bargains with grasping oligarchs to keep his grip on power. A liberal hope of today's would-be Russian Spring, meanwhile, is the high-profile blogger, Alexei Navalny, a 35-year-old commercial lawyer who has intrepidly chronicled the corruption of the Putin regime. It was Navalny, showing a talent for politics, who coined Putin's United Russia as \"the party of crooks and thieves\"\u2014and who after last week's parliamentary vote called on readers of his blog to join a Moscow street protest against the \"stolen elections.\" He was himself arrested and sent to jail for supposedly disobeying police at a post-election protest \u2014 an action that has only helped to authenticate his anti-regime credentials.

A U.S. solider on patrol in the restive northern oil-rich city of Kirkuk, on July 27, 2011. President Obama's announcement that all U.S. troops will withdraw from Iraq by the end of the year has prompted significant debate over the prudence of the policy. From the the politics of the decision, to possible threats of sectarian violence and the influence of Iran, opinion is sharply divided. Ted Koppel, Ret. Gen. Jack Keane, Bob Woodward, Brian Katulis and Peter Van Buren joined NPR's Neal Conan on Talk of the Nation today and weighed in. Ted Koppel, NPR commentator: \"The U.S. military certainly believes that this is a precipitous withdrawal, and it's a very dangerous time,\" said Koppel. \"You can absolutely believe that going in to Iraq in the first place was a terrible mistake, and still believe that the way we're getting out right now is also a terrible mistake. ... \"As much as the world loathed Saddam Hussein, Saddam Hussein was the equalizing force in the Persian Gulf that kept Iran in check. When George Bush ordered the invasion of Iraq in 2003, he did for the Iranians what they were never able to do for themselves: He got rid of Saddam Hussein. We also disarmed the Iraqis. ... Whereas back nine years ago Iran and Iraq had roughly equivalent military forces, these days Iran has larger, more powerful military forces than it did back nine years ago. Iraq, by contrast, has zero combat helicopters, zero fixed-wing aircraft, zero heavy artillery, zero heavy tanks. Without U.S. forces in there, if Iran were to make a move against Iraq again ... it would be devastating.\" Ret. Gen. Jack Keane: Keane was quoted in The Washington Times calling the decision an \"absolute disaster.\" He explained on the show that \"the Bush administration stabilized and provided a relatively secure environment ... as the Obama administration was coming into office ... There was a wink and a nod between all the Iraqi national leaders, to include parliamentary members, and certainly U.S. officials, to include our military officials, that once the [U.S.] election was over with, the Iraqis would be prepared to renegotiate the Status of Forces agreement, which would permit then our forces to stay somewhat indefinitely.\" Keane said influence, not security, was the goal. \"We wanted to continue to strengthen Iraq's democracy ... to continue to grow and develop the Iraqi security forces,\" he said. And another concern was the influence of the Iranians. \"When we have stayed post-conflict in the past, in our history \u2014 Germany, Japan, Korea to name some \u2014 it is a stabilizing influence. ... When we have moved out rapidly \u2014 Vietnam, Somalia, Haiti \u2014 things have a tendency to fall apart. We knew that, the military commanders knew that, and the Obama administration rejected Gen. [Lloyd J.] Austin's ... proposal to maintain a reasonable force that would be able to accomplish the goals I just stated.\" Bob Woodward, associate editor, The Washington Post: \"The level of distress within the military couldn't be higher at this decision. I've even heard talk about some senior people in the military discussing resigning over this.\" The alternative to the withdrawal, Woodward said, is to try to persuade the Iraqi government to let some troops stay, to make \"absolutely the maximum effort to have [that] insurance policy\" in the Middle East. (Keane said in his opinion in would have been possible, though difficult, to get the Iraqi government to agree to give U.S. troops the legal immunity that U.S. officials said they would need.) Brian Katulis, senior fellow, Center for American Progress (which says it develops \"progressive ideas and action\"): \"This president came into office saying that we needed to re-balance our overall national security priorities and that we are over-invested in Iraq. ... What he is doing is implementing a security agreement that was signed in 2008 by the Bush administration and the Maliki government. Yes, there was an attempt to renegotiate it, and I actually think there [are] still attempts ongoing to figure out what the actual U.S. footprint will be, because there will be a sizable footprint, and I think there will be a lot of creative fictions related to it. But on balance I think he's taken the right decision here as commander-in-chief to try to set our priorities straight.\" As for arguments about the Iranian threat, Katulis thinks they're overblown. He's more worried about the internal threats to Iraqis. \"You look at the challenges in the disputed territories ... you look at the Sunni community ... you look at the Iraqis that are affiliated with the U.S. There's a real challenge with those individuals.\" He thinks Iranian influence grew from 2003-2008, and Iraqi nationalism has countered it since then. \"Iran today is more isolated \u2014 not only regionally, but also internationally \u2014 and it's weak. I don't think it has as much credibility among the Iraqi people.\" Peter Van Buren, a Foreign Service officer who recently lost his security clearance and diplomatic passport in part because of critical things he wrote in a book about the U.S. effort in Iraq \u2014 We Meant Well: Van Buren says the Iranians have a tremendous influence in Iraq, but aren't a military threat. \"The Iranians are not going to attack Iraq with tanks and grenades. They don't need to. They've already successfully shown that they can influence events there. The prize of the oil is in the Southern part of Iraq, and the Iranians are a steady influence there.\" \"The decision [to withdraw] was made in Baghdad,\" he said, not by President Obama. And he doesn't believe a small force staying behind would make any difference. \"The issues that we uncorked in 2003 \u2014 the Sunni/Shia, the Arab/Kurd, and in particular, the rise of Iran's power in Iraq \u2014 were not stopped by 100,000 soldiers during the surge, and they haven't been whittled back by 40,000 soldiers during the last two years.\" As the U.S. has stepped back from internal politics in Iraq, \"the Iranians have filled that void very comfortably, and will continue to do so. This is not a battle that is going to be won by shooting anyway. The Iranians are winning it through economic means, through religious tourism, and particularly through working with the oil producers.\"",

Anders Behring Breivik has admitted bombing Norway's capital and opening fire on a political youth group retreat, but he entered a plea of not guilty, saying he wanted to save Europe from Muslim immigration. Jamie Bartlett is head of the Violence and Extremism Programme at the London-based think tank Demos. Jonathan Birdwell is a researcher on the Violence and Extremism Programme at Demos. They are currently undertaking a major research project into the growth of far-right street-based movements across Europe, including the largest ever survey of far-right activists, which is due to be completed in October 2011. For the past five years, in the bastions of civilized Europe, the far right has been resurgent. Extreme right-wing political parties have scored unprecedented electoral success in a number of countries, including Austria, France, the Netherlands, and Sweden. Far-right street movements of disgruntled young men, barely seen for a generation, are appearing in greater numbers in busy Strassen, plazas, and boulevards. Until Friday, governments and the security services viewed this as a worrying trend, but one that could be contained. With the stunning, tragic attacks in Norway, that has now changed. Intelligence agencies, concerned more with al Qaeda for a decade, are suddenly alert to a new and deadly threat. Possibly more significant, the growing power of these parties exerts a gravitational pull on the political center. David Cameron and Angela Merkel both recently announced the death of multiculturalism, and Nicolas Sarkozy's burqa ban has been a vote-winner in France. Below the political fracas, a new breed of far-right and nationalist street-based groups are also getting a more confident swagger. In Britain, the English Defence League (EDL) has employed a similar blend of far-right and populist ideas, springing up in 2006 to protest against what it sees as creeping Islamism in British society. With smart use of social media sites, the EDL has been able to mobilize between 2,000-3,000 people for demonstrations, and claims to have a Facebook membership of 90,000. Britain has not seen anything like it since the 1970s. (Anders Behring Breivik, the Oslo bomber and Utoya gunman, is believed to have been in contact with members of this group \u2014 possibly even attending a March in 2010 \u2014 and openly admired their tactics; he wanted to set up a Norwegian Defence League.) In France, Le Bloc Identitaire is a street-based movement that has arranged pork and wine parties outside mosques, as a statement of defence to the French secular constitution. In our research, we have found that these groups are often torn between sometimes conflicting goals of seeking respectability among their peers and recruiting new members. In Denmark, where we were conducting fieldwork last week, the extreme far right is fragmented over positions on anti-Semitism, homosexuality, and race. Many are now talking about themselves as \"modern nationalists\" focused on the growth of Islam, while trying to dissociate themselves from Nazi connotations to gain legitimacy. Interestingly, comments on a forum of one of the newest far-right groups \u2014 the Danskernes Parti (Danes' Party) \u2014 led by an up-and-coming 21-year-old named Daniel Carlsen, claim that Breivik is a \"madman,\" not a nationalist, and is \"pro-Jewish\" as a member of the Freemasons. It is in this febrile environment that the creaking networks of neo-Nazis, white supremacists, and Christian fundamentalists, are finding new life and new recruits. The truly radical right in Europe is still only miniscule, but even before the Oslo attacks, signs of a coming revival were evident. Of course, each far-right group has its own idiosyncracies. Indeed, the first rule of extreme right-wing movements is to not offend national sentiments. Some radical right-wing groups, as the British neo-Nazi terrorist group Combat 18, are obsessed with anti-Jewish conspiracy theories. Others believe in racial supremacy and the importance of Aryan purity. In Scandinavia, Nordic mythology often features. Some share overlap with violent football hooligan groups, like White Pride in Aarhus. It is these groups that intelligence and security agencies have long followed, as violence is a central part of their worldview \u2014 an important point that distinguishes them from more mainstream groups. The relationship between ascendant far-right extremism and political violence is suddenly a top political and security concern. Right-wing groups will come under great scrutiny, and governments are likely to re-examine the case for proscribing some of them. But should they? For the past six months, we have been examining this question through a large-scale survey of extreme right-wing political activists and sympathizers across Europe. The answer is far from simple. Over the last decade, the extreme right in Europe has become more palatable. The overt racism and chest-beating nationalism of previous years have been discarded. What characterizes the new far-right is a defiant, aggressive defense of national culture and history in the face of a changing world, of secularism, and even of democracy and liberty. While each has its idiosyncrasies, far-right parties are responding to genuine concerns of many voters: that modern globalization hasn't benefitted them, that mass immigration \u2014 especially from Muslim-majority countries \u2014 is threatening local and national identity. Perhaps most important, these new far-right parties like Geert Wilders' Freedom Party in the Netherlands or Marine Le Pen's Front National in France expertly portray mainstream politicians as spineless, soft-boiled, venal, self-serving slaves to political correctness and orthodoxy. Recent events \u2014 such as banking bailouts, the Eurozone crisis, and the News International hacking scandal \u2014 certainly lend some credibility to the view that politicians are indeed out of touch with ordinary people. This potent mix of populism and far-right ideas \u2014 often utilizing powerful historical and cultural reference points, such as enlightenment philosophers and national flags \u2014 has meant the forming of new alliances and a blurring of obvious left and right lines. Thilo Sarrazin, for example, author of the book Germany Does Away With Itself, which argues that the country is sleepwalking into a multicultural abyss, is a prominent member of the left-wing Social Democratic Party. One leader of a Danish far-right organization described himself to us as an atheist Marxist. A significant chunk of European voters is clearly impressed. Le Pen is currently third in the polling for the 2012 French presidential election. Wilders' Freedom Party is also the third-largest in the Netherlands. In Scandinavia, the True Finns, the Danish People's Party, and the Swedish Democrats all secured their best-ever electoral results over the past 18 months. Germany and Austria's far-right parties are resurgent, sparking atavistic European fears. Further east, the Jobbik Party is now the third largest political party in Hungary, having doubled its seats during the last election. Of course, the political right actively distances itself from the more extreme fringes. But there is certainly some ideological overlap between them. They share an affinity for inflammatory rhetoric premised on anexistential crisis. Western civilization is under threat, attacked by multiculturalists, Jews, and Muslims bent on destroying Christendom and national identity. Breivik's \"manifesto\" \u2014 a 1,500-page enunciation of his thinking posted online just hours before his killing spree \u2014 illustrates these themes precisely. He explains how cultural Marxism has destroyed European identity, with multiculturalists willingly complicit. Islam, he says, is now the biggest threat to Norway (and Europe) through \"demographic warfare.\" We found this sentiment rife among a variety of far-right groups in Denmark. No one really knows the exact relationship between extreme right-wing movements and political violence. Indeed, academics are still arguing, without resolution, about whether peaceful but extreme Islamist organizations are \"gateways\" into Islamist terrorism. Yet all terrorists believe they are defending a wider constituency, fighting for ideas that others agree with but are too ignorant or afraid to take action. Breivik made one, eerie tweet from his account, paraphrasing the liberal philosopher John Stuart Mill: \"One person with belief is equal to the force of 100,000 who have only interests.\" Like al Qaeda, far-right terrorists often see themselves as vanguards \u2014 striking a blow that will awaken the masses. There's no question that someone like Anders Behring Breivik is more likely to find that environment in Europe now than a decade ago. And though he may have acted alone, there are certainly more like him who share his concerns, his ideology, and his belief that without immediate and drastic action Western civilization will be lost. The world can no longer afford to ignore this growing threat",

France, though, has refused to accept even a trainload holding visas from Italy. One big reason for the French resistance is the political challenge French President Nicolas Sarkozy faces from the right. Recent polling shows Sarkozy trailing Marine Le Pen, the leader of France's anti-immigrant National Front Party, ahead of next year's election. Mainstream politicians all across Europe are feeling pressure from the right. In Finland, the nationalist True Finns won 39 seats in Parliament earlier this month. The True Finns were rewarded with the chairmanship of the Foreign Affairs Committee Tuesday and will be looking to make more gains as negotiations over the shape of the incoming coalition government continue this week. The rise of far-right parties \u2014 not just in France and Finland but in numerous other countries across Europe \u2014 has the potential to call into question not only immigration politics but the prospects for continuing bailouts of economically struggling European Union member states. As parties promoting nationalism gain strength, Europe will struggle to speak with one voice \u2014 in terms of projecting military and diplomatic power abroad, as well as setting economic policy, says Charles Kupchan, who served as a White House adviser on European affairs under President Bill Clinton. \"I would suppose for Europe, this is its most significant political crisis since the project [of unification] began in the 1950s,\" says Kupchan, now a senior fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations. Not Neo-Nazis In some ways, the rise of these right-wing parties is both a cause and a symptom of the trouble that Europe finds itself in. For the first time in my career, it's conceivable to me that the European Union could start unraveling. I wouldn't bet on it, but the stakes right now are so high that it's conceivable that the EU has hit its high-water mark and will go no further, or go into reverse. Charles Kupchan, senior fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations Europe has long been home to populist, anti-establishment parties. But today's far-right leaders bear little stylistic resemblance to the neo-Nazis who emerged roughly 20 years ago, at the end of the Cold War. Le Pen and Timo Soini, the leader of the True Finns, are both smooth and charismatic figures. And where Le Pen's father, Jean-Marie, as leader of the National Front a decade ago, dismissed the Nazi gas chambers as a \"detail\" of history, Marine Le Pen has called the Holocaust the worst episode of the 20th century. The fact that they can express extreme views  with \"a veneer of acceptability\" actually makes today's far-right leaders more dangerous than yesterday's skinheads, says Simon Tilford, chief economist for the Centre for European Reform, a London-based think tank that favors European integration. Today, there's a greater sense of unease about Europe's place in a globalized economy, Tilford says. To the extent that far-right parties that can speak to that unease in ways that come off as reasonable, they can not only capitalize on it politically, but potentially force other politicians to adopt similar language or sentiments. \"The far-right movements that we're seeing \u2014 not all of them, but a few of them \u2014 pose a greater challenge than those we saw in the 1980s and 1990s,\" Tilford says. \"They're expressing extreme positions but in a far more polished way, and there's a danger of such views becoming more socially acceptable.\" Boundaries Being Pushed Sarkozy, British Prime Minister David Cameron and German Chancellor Angela Merkel have each expressed concern in recent months about problems associated with Muslim immigrants and the \"failures\" of assimilation and multiculturalism. Head of the French Front National Party Marine Le Pen arrives at her party's office after casting a ballot in Henin-Beaumont, France, on March 27, during the second round of the local elections.\n                \n                    \n                    Philippe Huguen/AFP/Getty Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption On his first day on the job last month, Hans-Peter Friedrich, Germany's new interior minister, said, \"To say that Islam belongs in Germany is not a fact supported by history.\" The new Hungarian Constitution, signed into law on Monday, overtly refers to Hungary as a Christian nation. Aside from a change in tone politically, economists worry that nativist sentiments promoted by far-right parties will undermine European nations' prospects for pulling each other out from fiscal crises. Bailout packages have already been extended to Greece, Ireland and Portugal. \"This was a referendum on EU policy,\" Soini, the True Finns leader, said following his party's electoral gains. \"We will keep our money and our right to make our own decisions.\" Growing Euro-Skepticism The bailouts have left everyone unhappy, says Kurt Volker, a former U.S. ambassador to NATO. \"If you're in the north like Finland, you resent having to bail out people to the south,\" says Volker, now a senior fellow at the Johns Hopkins School of Advanced International Studies. \"If you're in the south, you resent being told what to do by the north.\" The problems Europe faces financially have opened up a lot of political room for anti-incumbent parties \u2014 not all of them on the right. Volker predicts that France's next election will be won by socialists, \"unless they really screw it up.\" But the ultraconservative parties are gaining popularity explicitly on a platform of opposition both to immigration and the European Union's economic policies. And their ability to win power \u2014 or sway those who hold it \u2014 matters a lot. EU policies are set by consensus, meaning that a single country can torpedo any future bailout deal. Already, Continental fiscal policies are too cautious in the eyes of many economists because domestic politics interfere with more rigorous measures that might be required. \"In some ways, the rise of these right-wing parties is both a cause and a symptom of the trouble that Europe finds itself in,\" says Kupchan, the CFR senior fellow. \"For the first time in my career, it's conceivable to me that the European Union could start unraveling. I wouldn't bet on it, but the stakes right now are so high that it's conceivable that the EU has hit its high-water mark and will go no further, or go into reverse.\"",

Two days after the resignation of Hosni Mubarak, the army is asserting its control.\n                \n                    \n                    John Moore/Getty Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption Egyptian army soldiers walk through Tahrir Square after opening it for traffic on Sunday in Cairo, Egypt. Two days after the resignation of Hosni Mubarak, the army is asserting its control. Reuel Marc Gerecht is a senior fellow at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies and a contributing editor to The Weekly Standard. An unrelentingly severe critic of the fallen Tunisian dictator Zine El-Abidine Ben Ali, my longtime Tunisian taxi driver Moussa, who has lived in Brussels for 20 years, sounded an optimistic note last week. \"[The army] may not screw us. The officers know that Tunisia has fundamentally changed. I can't believe what the Tunisian press is saying now \u2014 nothing is off-limits \u2014 and the army hasn't tried to stop them. The army knows that the people will never forgive them if they again imprison and torture people.\" Though the old regime is far from dead in Tunisia, Tunisians are collectively crossing their fingers that the military, as an institution, is willing to take a risk on a new order where its perks are far from guaranteed. Should we expect the Egyptian military \u2014 the first Arab army to be \"modernized\" (Tunisia's was the second) \u2014 to remain true to \"the Arab street,\" which has now downed the most powerful Arab dictator? The army in Egypt is massively invested in the dictatorial status quo that President Hosni Mubarak built after he assumed power from the slain Anwar Sadat in 1981. Where once the military life guaranteed at best a genteel poverty, senior Egyptian officers now live like pashas, with incomes far beyond their official salaries. Add to this pyramid of military privilege civilian relatives of senior military officers who've used their access and protection to game Egypt's system of crony capitalism, and mid-ranking officers who can't conceive of themselves outside of the orbit of their uniformed patrons, and you've got a legion of men and women who really don't want Egypt to change that much. The enemy of reform and democracy in Egypt \u2014 and everywhere else in the Arab world \u2014 isn't only the power of dictators and their families but also the appetite and expectations of their armed forces, which created modern authoritarianism. The democratic wave that has finally struck the Arab world is, among other things, a civilian protest movement against the militarization of Middle Eastern life. Old Oriental despotisms, for all their unpleasantness, did not fundamentally assault the civilian nature of Muslim societies, where men of the cloth, letters, the bazaar, and small-town aristocracies defined the \"good and noble.\" The Egyptian Gamal Abdel Nasser, the icon of modern, demagogic militarism, swept away the old world and promised a nationalist and Arabist renaissance. Spiritually crushed by the 1967 Israeli victory, and economically impoverished by socialism, this new-age authoritarianism halfheartedly discovered capitalism in the 1980s. Robbed of ideology and military purpose (defeating Israel became a millenarian dream, like the ancient Arab aspiration to conquer Constantinople), Arab armies became instruments of political oppression and private enrichment. They did, however, remain conscript armies. Unlike the despotisms of old, which were dependent on small, professional armies of slave soldiers (in Egypt, they were called \"mameluks\"), modern autocracy has depended on the common man. Nationalism, the most successful Western export to the Muslim world, is sacred for most Egyptians \u2014 even for the Muslim Brotherhood, whose universalist Islamic aspirations have been in a tug-of-war with Egyptian nationalism for 80 years. And this patriotic common man has increasingly embraced democracy as the only legitimate organizing political ideal. How much has the seductive idea of democracy percolated from the bottom up, and from the top down via intellectuals, into the officer ranks of the Egyptian Army? Do the senior officers really believe in a \"soft landing\" in a democratic Egypt? A democratic Egypt, cursed with bloated bureaucracies and a still vibrant socialist ethic, would likely cut back military expenditures severely in an effort to maintain public-sector civilian jobs. More or less, the Egyptian Army has been able to wall off its defense budget \u2014 and senior officers' posh lifestyles \u2014 from economic reality. America's yearly billion-dollar military-aid package has allowed the Egyptian Army to enjoy toys \u2014  advanced Abrams tanks, F-16 aircraft, and Israeli-ship-killing surface-to-surface missiles \u2014 that would be unthinkable if purchased only through Egyptian taxes. It's a decent guess that a democratic Egypt will distance itself from America's military largesse \u2014 seeing it, not incorrectly, as an enabler of autocracy. A democratic Egypt will demand a more humble, less well-fed military establishment. Do Egyptian military officers believe that angry liberals and even angrier Muslim Brothers won't eventually expropriate all that their families have accumulated under martial rule? The denouement of Mubarak's reign may give hope to the military for a soft landing. The lack of violence in the demonstrations throughout the country \u2014 despite the bloody provocations of Egyptian security forces \u2014 has been astonishing. It would be unwise to underestimate the vengeful sentiments that are undoubtedly widespread or to overestimate the moderating effect of Egypt's age-old settled culture, which has little of the open nastiness so common in Algeria or Iraq. But the restraint of the demonstrators has been \u2014 for the Egyptians themselves \u2014 ennobling. This pacifism has certainly deterred the army from brutality; it may well push the military towards backing more representative government over the coming months. We should, however, assume that the military's recidivist impulse is strong. We should also assume that the Egyptian Army doesn't yet view the events of January and February as the prelude to a real revolution, but only as an uprising that required Mubarak to depart in order to preserve \"the system.\" President Obama appears to be abandoning the pro-authoritarian, status-quo realism that had defined his administration's policy toward the Middle East. The June 12, 2009, electoral earthquake in Tehran barely shook the White House (the diplomatic effort to stop the mullahs' quest for nuclear weapons trumped whatever pro-democracy empathy President Obama may have felt for the Iranian demonstrators). But Tahrir   Square may have finally broken the hold that Washington's authoritarian-tolerant liberal foreign-policy establishment (think the pro-Mubarak emissary Frank Wisner) had on the president. Bill Burns, Middle Eastern dictators' favorite diplomat at the State Department, may still be number three at Foggy Bottom, but it's a good guess that he will no longer be making quips about how U.S. foreign policy aims to turn \"Putin into our [Russian] Mubarak.\" (The idea actually now has a certain appeal.) Contrary to so much chic leftist chatter, the United  States still has an important role to play in Egypt's democratic transition. We still possess considerable financial leverage on Egypt's military; we should not hesitate to use it if the army doesn't immediately end the draconian police-state emergency regulations and soon establish a transitional government whose membership includes prominent nonmilitary men. A transitional government should be open to all \u2014 including members of the Muslim Brotherhood \u2014 and must have real authority. That government, not the military, should set the calendar for new elections and decide whether Egypt's current constitution can be revised or is better chucked into the trash bin. (Probably the latter.) As President Obama may know now, the most difficult time for his administration lies in the months ahead, when the Egyptian Army will test to see how much autocracy (and wealth) it can keep in its hands. There will surely be an enormous temptation in Washington, on both the left and right, to side with the army for a \"slow\" transition or even a \"restrictive democracy,\" where the Muslim Brothers are excluded from parliament. Much of Washington, like most in the European Union, wants to support democracy in Egypt, but a democracy that follows the exact same policies as Mubarak's dictatorship. Such a democracy is unlikely to be born. Egyptians need the liberty to grow as they see fit and as they can. Real liberal democracy in the Arab world lies down this difficult path. There is reason to hope that President Obama, whose sympathies in the past inclined him toward \"authentic\" third-world potentates, may understand now that George W. Bush was right to castigate the foreign policy that Bush senior adored. In any case, President Obama and Egypt are now tied together. If Egyptian democracy gets off the ground, the odds are decent that the president will be able to reinvent himself overseas. That may not be enough to save him in 2012 from his domestic policies. But it might.",

Turks  voted to adopt 26 major reforms. Now that the primary goal of the protesters in Egypt has been satisfied and President Hosni Mubarak has been removed from office, the country faces countless questions about how swiftly it can move toward free and fair elections \u2014 assuming it will. Transitions to democracy are often tricky. From Turkey to Thailand, there are plenty of examples of militaries removing unpopular presidents and then moving on to hold elections. But these have sometimes led again to coups. For Egypt to establish itself as a true democracy, its military will have to make clear its willingness to cede power to civilian rulers. \"If they try to appoint a general to run the country, then people are going to be nervous about that and push for a quick election,\" says Thomas Carothers, the director and founder of the Democracy and Rule of Law Program at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace. \"If there is a national unity or caretaker government with real legitimacy, then you don't feel the pressure to hold elections so soon,\" he says. Beat Back The Rush Egypt should find a \"sweet spot,\" Carothers says, between attempting to vote in a new government either too soon or too late. Democracy is about more than elections, after all. A nation that has operated under one-man rule for decades can't be expected to switch to multiparty democracy overnight. Holding an election in September, as had been scheduled, would be too soon, Mohammed ElBaradei, a Nobel Peace Prize laureate and leading opposition figure, told NPR's Robert Siegel on Friday. \"We need at least a year of building the country from scratch,\" ElBaradei said. \"We need to build every institution. ... We don't even have the right political parties.\" Holding an election seven months from now would require a swift sprint. But while agreeing that Egypt needs to build up its civic and political institutions, some analysts and democracy advocates argue that holding elections soon will lend legitimacy to everything that follows, including writing a new constitution and establishing political parties. \"There need to be plausible promises that elections will in fact be held in a reasonable time frame,\" says Michael Herb, director of the Middle East Institute at Georgia State University. \"If one were just to sit around and wait for a stable political party system to emerge in Egypt, one could wait a long time.\" The Rules Of The Game There are countless mechanical questions that would have to be answered even before elections could be administered, such as registering political parties and setting up a credible, independent body to oversee the election process. Opposition leader Mohamed ElBaradei (left forefront) arrives to speak to supporters in Cairo's Tahrir Square.\n                \n                    \n                    Peter Macdiarmid/Getty Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption Opposition leader Mohamed ElBaradei (left forefront) arrives to speak to supporters in Cairo's Tahrir Square. The latter job used to be handled by the Egyptian judiciary but was turned over to the Interior Ministry for last year's parliamentary elections. That will not be acceptable going forward, says Leslie Campbell, regional director for the Middle East and North Africa at the National Democratic Institute, a democracy promotion group. \"There has not been an election in Egypt in our lifetimes that anybody thinks would stand up to scrutiny as an independent election,\" Campbell says. Egyptians \u2014 including the military and any opposition leaders who end up becoming part of negotiations about setting up a new government \u2014 will have to determine how best to proceed in legal terms as well. The current constitution contains numerous barriers to block free and fair elections, experts say. Changing it would be time consuming, but ignoring it creates the risk of building a democracy on an extralegal foundation. \"The problem is that if you go by the letter of the constitution, amending it requires a two-thirds majority in the Parliament and then a referendum after that,\" says Adeed Dawisha, a political scientist at Miami University of Ohio. \"I don't know if, in Egypt's current situation, you can do that \u2014 tell the people to go home because we're going to spend three months amending the constitution.\" Getting To Agreement Whatever steps the political process takes from here, it's important that they be based on wide agreement among all the major parties or stakeholders involved, says John Stremlau, vice president for peace programs at the Carter Center, which has monitored dozens of elections internationally. \"You want to have a rule-bound process that has gotten consensus from the critical actors who are essential to implementing it,\" Stremlau says. \"Get a process going that they're willing to make transparent and inclusive \u2014 and agreements they'll stick to, that they've struck voluntarily.\" Revolutions have often been hijacked by radical fringes after power first changes hands. And national militaries have helped to set up elections, only to intervene once again later. But there are examples of successful negotiations that included both opposition leaders and either the military or the incumbent regime, including Poland and South Africa, notes Larry Diamond, a senior fellow at the Hoover Institution and co-editor of the Journal of Democracy. \"Egypt is not ready for complete legislative elections, but it would be best to have what the protesters are demanding \u2014 set up some body so there are some rules and a check on the executive,\" Diamond says. \"The ideal would be having the regime and a representative body of outsiders come up with rules for the transition.\" Looking For Models Elsewhere As Egyptians look for models, they are likely to think about Turkey \u2014 a country that has experienced several coups over the past half-century but now has a healthy, competitive democratic system in place. Credit: NPR \"The Turkish experience is something that they're definitely looking at very  closely,\" says David Cuthell, executive director of the Institute of Turkish  Studies at Georgetown University. \"But Egyptian nationalism is far more benign  and less hard-edged than Turkish nationalism. If they can get into a regular  process of voting and reform, they could go through the steps a lot quicker than  Turkey.\" By which Cuthell means, Egypt may not take as many  decades as Turkey did to remove the military from a central political role.  But Egypt also enjoys some other advantages over other, more recent  experiments in democratic transition within the Muslim world. Unlike Iraq and  Afghanistan, their move toward democracy is homegrown, not the result of  military invasion. Egypt has a richer sense of national identity than either of those countries and will be able to project central government authority in a way that has been elusive thus far for Afghanistan, analysts say. \"The risk in democratic transitions is that the state falls apart,\" says Michael Herb, the Georgia State political scientist. \"That won't happen in Egypt.\" Not Expecting Sectarian Violence Egypt may experience many internal divisions, but given the fact that its population is 90 percent Sunni Muslim, it won't be ripe for the sectarianism that has plagued Iraq. \"What made Iraq so violent is basically a tremendous power shift between the Shiites and the Sunnis, which the Sunnis don't want to accept,\" says Carothers of the Carnegie Endowment. Dawisha, the Miami University political scientist, says that Egyptian democracy will not be \"tarnished\" by sectarian violence, as Iraq's was. The Egyptian divide, he says, will lie between secularists and Islamists. Many American commentators have already expressed concern that Egypt after Mubarak could fall under the sway of religious parties. The Muslim Brotherhood has been Mubarak's main opposition for years. But Dawisha says it's impossible to guess how strong political support for Islamist parties like the Muslim Brotherhood will turn out to be. He argues that free and fair elections will settle that question \u2014 as well as bring the Mubarak era to its true end. \"Fair elections are the only thing that will get people to believe that the next era is going to be what they've been clamoring for,\" Dawisha says. \"In the end, you trust democracy.\"",

I long to be back in Cairo. I have fond memories of the two years I spent there from 1965 to 1967. I remember sipping sweet black tea in the Old City's Khan al-Khalili souk, hanging out on weekends at Groppi's Tea Room, and riding the train to the southern suburb of Maadi, where I attended an international high school. I have vivid memories of Tahrir   Square's chaotic sidewalks. There were crowds of people everywhere, a moving mosaic of gentle, jostling chaos. It was a noisy city, home to both considerable wealth and desperate poverty, and over the three decades of President Hosni Mubarak's rule the inequality gap has grown even wider. I wish I could be there today, in solidarity with the thousands of young and old Egyptians, to celebrate the demise of his dreadful regime. But what we are witnessing is more than the end of a government \u2014 it is nothing less than the birth of a new liberal order in Egypt. And that's not only good news for the beleaguered citizens of Egypt, but also the United  States and Israel. The upheaval in Egypt marks the demise of two generations of stagnation in the Arab world that began with the Naksa (\"Setback\") \u2014 the Arabic word to describe the defeat in the 1967 war. That loss ushered in a cynical era of autocracy, corruption, repression, and fatalism. It marked the defeat of the secular Arab project and profoundly humiliated Egypt's Gamal Abdel Nasser, the last Arab leader who could plausibly claim to reflect the broad popular will. Nasser's defeat was also the defeat of any notion that the Arab world had a progressive, modernist future. In the wake of the 1967 war, Mohamed   Heikal, Egypt's prominent pundit, punned that power had shifted in the Arab world from thawra (\"revolution\") to tharwa (\"wealth\"). Not incidentally, the defeat of secular Arab nationalism created an intellectual vacuum that was filled by religiosity. As Syria's Yale-trained philosopher Sadik al-Azm said, \"At the same time, the political regimes responsible for the military defeat began utilizing religion in general and Islam in particular in a campaign designed to protect them from the aftermath of the defeat.\" Nasser's successor, Anwar Sadat, adopted the language of Islam, partly in an attempt to co-opt the Muslim Brotherhood and give himself a semblance of legitimacy. He cracked down on the secular left and shifted the regime to the right with his Open Door policies, welcoming American investment and influence. In the wake of the October 1973 war, Sadat was briefly seen as a genuinely popular national leader. In November 1977, he astonished everyone by flying to Jerusalem. Most Egyptians were tired of war and so welcomed the subsequent Camp David Accords and the Egypt-Israel peace treaty. But at the same time, Israel was still regarded with suspicion and even hostility. It was always a cold peace. And then, of course, Sadat was assassinated by a group of Army officers associated with a cell of radical Islamists. The man who succeeded him, Air Force officer Hosni Mubarak, was a political nonentity. Mubarak became the antithesis of Nasser. He used the military apparatus of Nasser's populist police state to sustain himself in power, but ditched the populism. Instead, he surrounded himself with a mercantile class of supplicants whom he favored with government contracts and outright graft. Nasser died with a modest bank account; Mubarak's family and associates have amassed fortunes reportedly worth $40 billion to $70 billion. The new pharaoh has ruled with arrogance, tolerated by the public out of a sense of fatalism and helplessness. But now the Egyptian people, led by a younger generation, are determined to force him unceremoniously from power. Without a doubt he will soon be gone \u2014 perhaps tomorrow, perhaps in a few weeks or months. But he will be gone, and with him an era. U.S. President Barack Obama's administration has no control over these events. But we are now more than two weeks into the popular upheaval; Washington should have understood far earlier that it will be disastrous if the new era begins without the clear perception that the United States is on the side of the Egyptian people. This is not the time for talking about an orderly transfer of power. That sends the wrong message to the democrats in the street \u2014 who by all accounts have acted orderly. They know from personal experience, and we can all see it on CNN and Al Jazeera, that it is only the regime's goons who have introduced disorder and violence into the uprising. It is also certainly a major blunder for the administration to have signaled even its tepid support for Omar Suleiman, Mubarak's intelligence chief. Just the other day, newly appointed Vice President Suleiman had the gall to say that Egyptians did not yet have a \"culture of democracy.\" Perhaps that's not altogether surprising from a secret police chief who is deeply complicit with America's renditions. Mamdouh Habib, an Egyptian-born Australian citizen who was detained by Pakistani security forces in October 2001 and subsequently flown by the CIA to Egypt, claims in his 2009 memoir My Story: The Tale of a Terrorist Who Wasn't that Suleiman personally took part in his torture-interrogation. How the Obama administration could hitch its fortunes to such a man, even briefly, is inexplicable. Perhaps the administration hesitates to wholly embrace the populist tsunami out of fear that Mubarak's fall signals the end of the Camp David regime, which has kept the peace between Egypt and Israel for 30 years. But a democratic Egypt could in the long run deliver to Israel something much better than Camp David's moribund cold peace. At the time, U.S. President Jimmy Carter's 1978 Camp David Accords \u2014 followed by the 1979 Egypt-Israel peace treaty \u2014 were a diplomatic triumph. But Carter's successors failed to get Israel's prime ministers to loosen their grip over the territories occupied in 1967. Over the decades, Washington ritualistically condemned the building of more and more settlements in the West Bank \u2014 but did nothing to stop them. As such, Camp David is as discredited in the eyes of the Egyptian masses as is Mubarak himself. Indeed, one of the reasons Mubarak is so despised is that for three decades he made Egypt an accomplice to Israel's unilateralism. But this does not mean that the Egypt of the Tahrir Square era will confront Israel militarily, or even break diplomatic relations. There is no domestic appetite for war. Nevertheless, the cold peace Israel has forged with Arab dictators is unraveling. This may, in the short term, empower Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's Likud ideologues who will argue that Arab democrats are out to \"delegitimize\" Israel. But in the long run, the emergence of an Arab democratic polity should convince Israeli voters that their leaders have become too complacent and too isolationist. After Tahrir, a majority of Israelis may conclude that they can't live in the neighborhood without forging a real peace with their neighbors. The separation wall was never a real answer to Israel's security predicament, and it will be less so when a democratically elected government governs Egypt. The policy of separation \u2014 hafrada in Hebrew \u2014 had some short-term strategic viability when the largest Arab country was willing to police Israel's southern border and keep Hamas penned up inside its Gaza prison. But no legitimate government in Cairo will be able to continue its complicity with the Gaza blockade \u2014 particularly not if the Muslim Brotherhood is a player in a new government. In reality, Israel will come under renewed pressure to deal with both Hamas and the Palestinian Authority in the West Bank. Hamas's ideology is certainly vile, but it won the last Palestinian legislative election in 2006 and has more or less observed a cease-fire with Israel since early 2009. In December 2010, the Hamas prime minister in Gaza, Ismail Haniyeh, announced that his party would abide by any peace settlement if it were to be ratified by a referendum of the Palestinian people. Furthermore, as we recently learned from Al Jazeera's Palestine Papers \u2014 the leaked documents on the 2008 Abbas-Olmert talks \u2014 the two sides are not that far apart on a comprehensive peace settlement that would create a Palestinian state. So here is the uplifting news: What is happening in Tahrir Square may actually propel the politicians in Washington, Jerusalem, and Ramallah to forge the Israeli-Palestinian peace deal that all of us know is there for the taking. And if that doesn't happen? Absent a comprehensive peace settlement, Israel and the United  States will find themselves increasingly isolated in the new Middle East. Sure, there are imponderables and risks. But the real danger at the moment comes not from a strategic shift in the region, but rather from the possibility that Suleiman or some other Mubarak acolyte will use Egypt's Army to launch a coup d'\u00e9tat against the people in Tahrir Square. If that happens, Washington should break relations with the new dictator and impose economic sanctions. To do anything else would send a message to a new generation of Arabs that, like Mubarak and Suleiman, Americans don't think Arabs are ready for democracy. Mercifully, I don't yet see Egypt headed that way. Something else is happening in the Arab street \u2014 something extraordinarily good for the Arab world, but also good for Israel and America. We should embrace it.",

To Read A Different Opinion, Click Here John B. Judis is a senior editor of The New Republic. I thought that my reaction to President Obama's State of the Union speech was colored by having spent the day listening to Chicago mayoral candidates talk about pensions and potholes, or by the two Scotches I downed afterwards, but upon rereading the speech this morning, I'm once again convinced that this was Obama's best speech as president. I'm not so much referring to his rhetoric or delivery, both of which were fine, but to the way he answered the perennial question, \"What is to be done?\" Obama is in a difficult political position, similar to that of Bill Clinton in 1995: He and his party have been rebuked at the polls, and to the extent the voters sent a message, it is one that Obama had better ignore at his and the country's peril. It was summed up by freshman GOP Representative Nan Hayworth, who declared on the eve of the speech, \"The best thing the federal government can do is stop trying to create jobs.\" Obama could either capitulate to this nonsense (as to some extent Clinton did), defy his detractors (as Franklin Roosevelt did after the 1938 election), or find a way to change the conversation \u2014 a way that would allow him to do what was best for the country without dooming his party. He did the latter, and remarkably well. He used an appeal to economic nationalism to do it. By framing America's challenge in that fashion, he allowed himself to justify government and the further expansion of government spending and investment, and he provided a new villain (other than himself or the government) for the continuing economic downturn. And it wasn't simply economic nationalism as a kind of game of competition. National security was the subtext of Obama's appeal. Except at the height of the Great Depression in 1933, Americans have only approved the expansion of government when they saw their security as a nation threatened. Think of the Civil War, the two world wars, and the Cold War. Dwight Eisenhower justified his massive interstate highway program as a way of allowing tanks to get around the continent in the case of war. Ronald Reagan justified his foray into industrial policy \u2014 the creation of the semiconductor consortium, Sematech, in 1987 \u2014 as a way of preventing the bad guys from getting control of high-tech weaponry. We're not of course facing an adversary now similar to the Germans in 1941 or the Soviets in 1956, but the underlying themes endure, and Obama was able to use them to his advantage. The key moment in his speech was when he invoked America's Sputnik moment \u2014 a reference to when Americans learned to their horror in 1958 that the Soviets had beat them into space with the launch of the first satellite. At the time, the news about Sputnik justified a massive expansion of the space program and of federal grants for science and science education. Here's how Obama invoked Sputnik: \"Half a century ago, when the Soviets beat us into  space with the launch of a satellite called Sputnik\u00b8 we had no idea how we'd beat them to the moon. The science wasn't there yet. NASA didn't even exist. But after investing in better research and education, we didn't just surpass the Soviets; we unleashed a wave of innovation that created new industries and millions of new jobs.   This is our generation's Sputnik moment. Two years ago, I said that we needed to reach a level of research and development we haven't seen since the height of the Space Race. In a few weeks, I will be sending a budget to Congress that helps us meet that goal. We'll invest in biomedical research, information technology, and especially clean energy technology \u2014 an investment that will strengthen our security, protect our planet, and create countless new jobs for our people.\" So what, you might ask? The Cold War is over. But Americans know that we have a new economic, and possibly military, adversary across the Pacific, and that some of America's economic woes are due to our enormous trade deficit with China. So without saying so explicitly \u2014 which would have been impolitic to say the least (we are not at war with China, and should not do anything to encourage the notion) \u2014 Obama reaped the thematic rewards of a neo-Cold War metaphor that implied a threat to our national security without sowing the actual seeds of war. Clean-energy technology, high-speed rail \u2014 they're not just about spending money on new gadgets, they're about national defense and survival just as the highway program was. That was the unspoken theme of Obama's economic nationalism, and it framed the debate over government and the downturn in a new way that will allow him to promote the kind of measures that he has always wanted. What else about Obama's speech? In evaluating what a president says, it is important to distinguish generalities from specifics and subordinate clauses from main clauses. Generalities (\"I'm going to freeze spending\") don't count as much as specifics (\"We need to eliminate the wasteful Head Start program\"). Subordinate clauses (\"Although we do need to prune regulations\") don't count as much as main clauses (\"We need to protect citizens against dirty air and water\"). In his speech, Obama consistently threw rhetorical subordinate clauses to the opposition while preserving and defending his own liberal agenda in the main, specific clauses. Look at the way he described regulatory review: \"To reduce barriers to growth and investment, I've ordered a review of government regulations. When we find rules that put an unnecessary burden on businesses, we will fix them. But I will not hesitate to create or enforce commonsense safeguards to protect the American people. That's what we've done in this country for more than a century. It's why our food is safe to eat, our water is safe to drink, and our air is safe to breathe. It's why we have speed limits and child labor laws. It's why last year, we put in place consumer protections against hidden fees and penalties by credit card companies, and new rules to prevent another financial crisis. And it's why we passed reform that finally prevents the health insurance industry from exploiting patients.\" Obama used the same rhetorical strategy in discussing education and his health care bill. The opposition can't say they were ignored, but the thrust of his message was a defense of the agenda with which he came into office in January 2009. And to Obama's credit, he found a new way in this speech to present this message \u2014 a way will, one hopes, help reverse his administration's and the country's fortunes over the next two years.

After World War II, no nation ever built another one again.\n                \n                    \n                    Hulton Archive/Getty Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption Before Dec. 7, 1941, when the Japanese attacked Pearl Harbor, the number of battleships was the primary measure of a nation's sea power. After World War II, no nation ever built another one again. Joseph Nye coined the term \"soft power,\" but he says that strategy alone is no longer enough. In The Future of Power,  Nye explains that in the global information age, superpowers need a  \"smart power\" strategy \u2014 the hard power of coercion and payment, plus the  soft power of persuasion and attraction. Advances in technology have helped smaller actors compete on a global level, leading to a diffusion of power. China, Nye tells NPR's Neal Conan, is an example of a country that recently turned to soft power to augment its position on the world stage. In 2007, says Nye, Chinese President Hu Jintao advocated for an investment in soft power, which \"they did very well, with the Beijing Olympics in 2008, the Shanghai Exposition this year,\" says Nye. But they \"undercut all this soft power they built up,\" he says, when they locked up dissident and Nobel Peace Prize winner Liu Xiaobo. \"What you do domestically can do an awful lot to undercut or reinforce what you're doing \u2014 or trying to do \u2014 internationally.\" Nonstate actors figure prominently in the equation. Though we typically think of them as malicious \u2014 terrorist groups like al-Qaida \u2014 there are benign forces as well. Organizations such as Oxfam and the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation work outside the government to fight hunger and cure diseases. Read An Excerpt \"Governments are still the most important actor on the world stage, but the stage is just a lot more crowded, because technology has reduced the barriers to entry,\" says Nye. For example, \"Twenty or 30 years ago, if you wanted to have an international phone call that links all parts of the world, you could do it technologically, but it was expensive.\" But now all it takes is an Internet connection. Gone are the days when one or two superpowers defined world affairs. The stage is now crowded by emerging nations like China and India. \"If you look at the world in 1800, you'll notice that more than half of the world's population was in Asia, and more than half of the world's product was made in Asia,\" says Nye. But in the 1900s, the picture looked very different \u2014 half of the population still lived in Asia, but because of the Industrial Revolution, production dropped to 20 percent in the East. Now, in the 21st century, Asia is returning to a balance of half the population and half the production. \"That's sometimes called the rise of Asia.  It's actually the return of Asia, and that's a natural process,\" says Nye. And it's not a foregone conclusion that the growth of China and the relative decline of the U.S. will lead to conflict, says Nye. Those transitions \"often lead to disaster,\" Nye allows. For example, \"if you look at the origins of World War I, many people would say it was caused by the rise in the power of Germany, and the fear that created in Britain.\" But on the flip side, the United States' overtaking of Britain didn't lead to war. \"So it's not inevitable ... I think a lot depends on how we manage this,\" he says. And Nye is hopeful. He says it's not true that China is destined to \"eat our lunch or overtake us militarily and economically.\"  At least not anytime soon. by Joseph S., Jr. Nye Hardcover, 300 pages | Your purchase helps support NPR programming.

            "article_content": "Republican and Democratic House members agree on very little, to put it mildly. And the gap is even greater when it comes to members of the House Republican Conference and members of the Congressional Black Caucus. But something Republican and Democratic incumbents generally agree on is the drawing of congressional district borders to safeguard their incumbent and partisan advantage and, in the case of the CBC, their racial upper hand in certain districts drawn to include mostly black voters. So it's worth noting the decision of a U.S. district court  judge in Miami Friday to dismiss a lawsuit filed by two House members, Republican Mario Diaz-Balart and Democrat Corinne Brown, a CBC member. The two federal lawmakers sued to stop a voter-approved amendment to Florida's constitution from taking effect. Amendment VI, approved by 63 percent of Florida voters last year, would place limits on how the state legislature draws the lines in an effort to reduce state legislators' chicanery in drawing congressional districts. Diaz-Balart and Brown sued, arguing that the amendment violated the U.S. Constitution's \"elections clause.\" That clause gives states the power to determine within limits, the \"time, place and manner\" of elections within their borders. The Congress members argued that the federal Constitution required the state legislature and not citizens to determine redistricting decisions. U.S. District Judge Ursula Ungaro disagreed, saying that the Framers and case law didn't support the lawmakers. One interesting aspect of the case was that the federal lawmakers argued that their lawsuit was in the interest of greater racial minority representation in Congress. From the Miami Herald: The veteran lawmakers said their aim was not to preserve their political bases, but to ensure that Hispanic and African American voters can elect minorities to Congress in a state that had none not so long ago. \"I am disappointed in the judge's ruling,\" said Brown, a 20-year House member who was among the first black candidates elected from Florida to Congress in 1992. \"But this is step one. We're going all the way to the U.S. Supreme Court.\" \"We have been working hard to make sure minorities have the right to elect candidates of their choice,\" said Diaz-Balart, a 10-year House veteran whose district includes parts of Miami-Dade and Broward counties. What makes that argument problematic is that the NAACP actually sided with Florida voters, as did the ACLU.",

Scott Applewhite/ASSOCIATED PRESS\n                    \n                \nhide caption Sen. John Thune, R-S.D. on Capitol Hill, Feb. 8, 2011. Forgive me for not breathlessly posting sooner on the news that Sen. John Thune, a South Dakota Republican, has announced he won't running for president in 2012. To which some readers will say \"who?\" Which is why I wasn't in such a rush. And why in part Thune decided against running. But remember, only a few years ago there was another lanky senator who was then mostly unknown to Americans and is now in the White House Oval Office. So it can happen. Just not for Thune. At least not in 2012. Thune explained that he wants to be where the action is now and that's the Senate. An excerpt: There is a battle to be waged over what kind of country we are going to leave our children and grandchildren and that battle is happening now in Washington, not two years from now. So at this time, I feel that I am best positioned to fight for America's future here in the trenches of the United States Senate. Tim Alberta at the National Journal notes that while Thune isn't well known outside South Dakota and Washington, his presumed interest in making the 2012 race had already factored into the thinking of some GOP presidential hopefuls: Thune's potential candidacy loomed large in the minds of other possible contenders. His profile, a young, conservative Midwesterner, could have appealed to the same demographics as candidates like former Minnesota Gov. Tim Pawlenty, or even Indiana Gov. Mitch Daniels. Both Pawlenty and Daniels will benefit without Thune in the race. Although he's passing on the chance to seek the presidency in 2012, Thune is only 50 years old, and he will remain a top contender for a future bid. After running unopposed in his 2010 re-election bid, Thune now boasts a war chest containing more than $7 million \u2014 an already-imposing amount that should continue to increase in the years leading up to the 2016 election. Because South Dakota borders Iowa, Thune might have had some appeal in that early GOP caucus. But Pawlenty of Minnesota share a larger border with Iowa so that no doubt neutralized one possible advantage Thune might've otherwise had. As Alberta points out, Thune is young and will still be relatively young in 2016. Bowing out now gives him plenty more time to work on raising his name-recognition.",

Marco Rubio as a vice presidential candidate would have no effect on their votes. \n                \n                    \n                    Yuri Gripas/Reuters /Landov\n                    \n                \nhide caption Nearly half of the Latino voters in a new survey said nominating Sen. Marco Rubio as a vice presidential candidate would have no effect on their votes. The overwhelming  majority of Latino voters believe that the Republican  Party ignores them or is  outright \"hostile,\" and that nominating Hispanic  Sen. Marco Rubio as a vice  presidential candidate might do little to  change it, according to a national  poll released Monday. The December survey,  conducted by impreMedia and the polling group  Latino Decisions, is the first to  test the popularity of the freshman  senator from Florida with  America's Hispanics. Since his  election in  2010, the 40-year-old Rubio, with his considerable political talents   and Tea Party support, has emerged as a figure expected to help improve  the  Republicans' outreach to Hispanics \u2014 whose population growth gives  them a pivotal  role in the 2012 elections. But Rubio and his  party may have a difficult time of it. (And not just because Rubio earlier stirred controversy when reporters raised questions about his background as a Cuban exile.) The survey  of 500 Latino registered voters found that Hispanics continue to lean toward President Obama  and other  Democratic candidates, and that they feel alienated by Republicans because of their   general support for tougher immigration enforcement instead of a path to  legal  status. Forty-six percent of  Latino voters said Republicans \"don't care too  much\" about Hispanics, and  another 27 percent said they \"are being  hostile,\" the poll found. And if Rubio  received his party's vice presidential nomination, only  13 percent of Latinos  said they would be \"much more likely\" to vote  Republican. Eleven percent said  they would be \"somewhat more likely\" to  vote Republican. And 46 percent said it  would \"have no effect\" on  their decision. Pollsters say the  strongest opinions \u2014 in this case, those \"much  more likely\" to vote Republican if  Rubio is nominated \u2014 tend to provide  the most accurate indicator of voting habits. \"I think they have a  very serious problem,\" Matt Barreto, the  principal pollster for Latino  Decisions, says of the Republican Party.  \"And Rubio is still new on the scene  and not extremely well known. Over  the last five years, a lot of Latinos have  been upset and moving away  from the party because of the hard stance on  immigration. So the  Republican Party has a lot of work to  do.\" Now the nation's  largest minority group, Latinos are expected to  factor heavily in next year's  elections. Some 22 million or more  Hispanics are projected to be eligible to  vote in 2012. And Latino turnout  could reach a record 12 million, according to the  National Association  of Latino Elected Officials. For 2012, strong  Hispanic turnout could easily determine Election  Day outcomes in several  battleground states with large Latino  populations, such as Florida, Nevada,  Colorado and possibly Virginia  (all states that  Obama won in 2008). \"I think most  [Republican] strategists look at the arithmetic and  realize they have to do a  little better with Hispanics if they want to  win the mountain states and some  others,\" says Jack Pitney, a political  science professor at Claremont McKenna  College in California. \"If Mitt  Romney is the nominee, he will probably consider  Rubio or [New Mexico  Gov.] Susana Martinez as his running mate. That wouldn't  bring the  Hispanic vote as a bloc, but it could reduce Obama's advantage. ... If   Mitt Romney could shift maybe 5 points among Latinos from Democrats to   Republicans, that could tip several close states to the  Republicans.\" Latino Decisions  says the nominee first has to shore up support  among Latino Republicans, who  have drifted away. The group's research  analyst, Gabriel Sanchez, cites poll  numbers showing that Rubio, as  the running mate, could help accomplish  that. \"Having Rubio on the  ticket will probably galvanize Latino  Republicans and get more of them out to  vote, but it probably won't  have much effect in getting crossover votes from  Latino Democrats,\"  says Sanchez, also a political science professor at the  University of   New  Mexico. Both parties are  devising Hispanic outreach strategies. The  Democratic Party is counting on  Hispanics to be an important part of a  coalition of support that includes  African-Americans and women. The Republican Party  is trying to mobilize in part by increasing its  support of promising Latino  candidates. The Republican State  Leadership Committee plans to invest $3 million  to recruit 100 Hispanic  candidates to run for state legislative seats across the  nation in  2012. But the GOP has an  uphill climb. In addition, the 2010 midterm  elections found that Latinos bucked  the Republican wave as roughly 60  percent of them voted for Democrats running  for House seats. As expected, the poll  found Latinos far more supportive of Democrats  than Republicans. For the first  time since February, more than 50  percent of Latino respondents said Democrats  are doing a \"good job\"  reaching out to them. But that support  remains soft, particularly for Obama. While the  president's overall job approval  among Latinos was 67 percent, only 32  percent \"strongly approve.\" (Still, that's much higher than the roughly 44 percent of voters overall who approve of the job Obama is doing as president, according to the Real Clear Politics polling average.) Only 43 percent of  Latinos said they are \"certain\" to vote for Obama  next year. At same time, just  9 percent said they are certain to vote  for a Republican presidential candidate. Barreto says that leaves 48  percent of Latinos who are \"on the fence, not necessarily  about which party  to support, but about whether to turn out to  vote.\" Latinos remain  frustrated at Obama for failing to push immigration  reform or the DREAM Act through Congress. More recently, Latino leaders  and pro-immigrant activists have  railed against the record number of  deportations carried out by the Obama  administration. The feelings of  dissatisfaction with both parties appears to explain  the lack of enthusiasm  Latinos expressed for next year's election. The  poll found that 44 percent of  respondents were \"very enthusiastic\"  about voting, far lower than in 2008. Barreto says that rate must rise  to 65 percent to ensure that Latino turnout  approaches that of 2008, when roughly 9.7 million Hispanic voters cast ballots.",

Last summer, immigration rights activists in Los Angeles gathered for a rally calling on the government to act on immigration overhaul legislation. Strong Latino support helped President Obama win in 2008, but his support among those voters is slipping. President Obama came into office with strong Latino support, having won two-thirds of the Latino vote, according to exit polls. But for some, that support has turned to disillusionment. \"There's a deep sense of betrayal and disappointment towards the Obama administration,\" said Sarahi Uribe, coordinator of the National Day Laborer Organizing Network. Indeed, the latest Gallup poll shows his support among Latino voters has fallen to 48 percent, a new low. Uribe singles out a program called Secure Communities, in which local police check the immigration status of those they arrest on other violations. The administration says the program has led to some 195,000 criminals being deported this past year \u2014 about half of all deportations. Uribe says many of those caught are for traffic violations and minor offenses. The president ran on a platform of immigration reform, but what we've seen is that he's actually leaving behind a legacy of deportation and criminalization. Sarahi Uribe, of the National Day Laborer Organizing Network \"The president ran on a platform of immigration reform,\" she said, \"but what we've seen is that he's actually leaving behind a legacy of deportation and criminalization.\" Latino leaders say the administration has been too tough on immigrants here illegally, deporting some 400,000 a year \u2014 more than the Bush administration ever deported in a single year. The leaders also say the administration hasn't done enough to push issues important to them, such as comprehensive immigration reform and the DREAM Act, which would allow some children of illegal immigrants to get in-state tuition for college, and a path to citizenship. Neither immigration reform nor the DREAM Act got through Congress. In a roundtable with Latino journalists last week, Obama said he couldn't pass the measures on his own. And, he insisted, the administration is being selective in those it deports. \"What we can do is to prioritize enforcement, since there are limited enforcement resources, and say, 'We're not going to go chasing after this young man or anybody else who's been acting responsibly and [who] would otherwise qualify for legal status if the DREAM Act passed,\" Obama said.  President Obama greets attendees after speaking during the Congressional Hispanic Caucus Institute's 34th Annual Awards Gala in Washington last month. The administration has been taking steps to win back the support of Latino voters.  President Obama greets attendees after speaking during the Congressional Hispanic Caucus Institute's 34th Annual Awards Gala in Washington last month. The administration has been taking steps to win back the support of Latino voters. The administration is taking other steps that may well help it win back the support of Latino voters. It's aggressively challenging tough immigration laws passed in Arizona and Alabama; and it's considering suing to overturn immigration laws passed in Utah, Indiana, Georgia and South Carolina. Still, political science professor Gabriel Sanchez of the University of  New Mexico is skeptical that these steps will help the president much with Latino voters. \"About a quarter of Latino voters know somebody personally who has been deported over the last several years,\" Sanchez said. \"That is very difficult to overcome with a change in policy this late in the game.\" But political analyst Victoria DeFrancesco Soto, a visiting scholar at the University  of Texas, says immigration isn't the only important issue to Hispanic voters. \"Immigration is an issue of concern to Latinos,\" she said, \"but that doesn't mean that we also don't also care about issues such as the economy and education \u2014 and actually those are issues that really affect the bulk of Latinos in a more day-to-day fashion than does immigration.\" In those areas, says DeFrancesco Soto, the administration can point to issues like the president's proposal for a national infrastructure bank, which would mean more construction jobs that might be filled by Latinos. The Republicans running for president, with the exception of Texas Gov. Rick Perry, are taking a hard line on immigration issues. So the real worry for the president isn't Latinos voting for Republicans \u2014 it's that they won't vote at all.",

Rubio's staff contacted the network to try  to convince them not to do the story. It's old news, they said \u2014 nothing to do  with Sen. Rubio, but hurtful to his family. Univision, as the nation's largest Hispanic  network, plays an important role for candidates \u2014 giving them unrivalled access to  Spanish-speaking voters. One of the network's anchors, Jorge Ramos, is an  outspoken advocate of the federal Dream Act, a bill Rubio opposes. Rubio has  turned down requests to appear on the program. In a conference call, Rubio staffers say  Univision's president of news, Isaac Lee, said he would consider softening the  story \u2014 or pulling it altogether \u2014 if Rubio would agree to appear on Ramos' talk  show. Univision says Lee never made such an  offer. The Herald says its story was confirmed both by Rubio staff and insiders  at the TV network. After seeing the story, three Republican  officials \u2014 all Rubio friends \u2014 wrote a letter to Univision, asking the network to  apologize and fire Lee. They also called on the Republican party and its presidential  candidates to boycott a debate the network was planning to hold before the  Florida  primary. One of the officials is the majority leader  in Florida's  House of  Representatives, Carlos Lopez-Cantera. He says, \"It's about a news  organization threatening to run a story that is irrelevant or embarrassing in  order to coerce or motivate somebody to participate in an interview or appear on  a show on their network.\" By Wednesday, several Republican  candidates \u2014 including Texas Gov. Rick Perry, former Massachusetts Gov.  Mitt Romney and businessman Herman Cain \u2014 said they would not take part in the  Univision debate. Rubio \u2014 the man at the center of the  dispute \u2014 has been mentioned as a possible pick for  vice president. Lopez-Cantera says he expects Hispanic  voters will still have an opportunity to hear from the Republican presidential  candidates. Another Hispanic network, Telemundo, is working with NBC to set up  its own debate before the Florida primary, now set for Jan. 31.",

            "article_content": "Republican presidential candidates at Fox News/Google debate in Orlando, Fla., Sept. 22, 2011.\n                \n                    \n                    Phelan M. Ebenhack/AP\n                    \n                \nhide caption Republican presidential candidates at Fox News/Google debate in Orlando, Fla., Sept. 22, 2011. Accepting the premise that the race for the Republican presidential nomination has come down to a two-man contest between the frontrunner Texas Gov. Rick Perry and Mitt Romney, the former Massachusetts governor, the question is which of those two candidates helped himself the most in Thursday evening's debate in Orlando, Fla.? Looked at that way, the answer has to be Romney. The former front-runner not only appeared to have the advantage over Perry in terms of stamina during the two-hour session hosted by Fox News and Google, he also made his points with more coherence and force.  Having gone through the rigors of a presidential race before, Romney knows how to prepare for these debates and it showed. Romney was disciplined, well-rehearsed and crisp, as one might expect from a one-time CEO of a private-equity firm. Thus, he made the most of his opportunities not only to raise doubts for voters about Perry's hostility towards Social Security as a federal entitlement but Perry's character. Romney had essentially two lines of attack on Perry. He kept on the offensive on Social Security, defending the popular program against Perry's rhetorical assault on it. Judging from Romney's use of the issue, he's decided it's perhaps his best chance to ding Perry, especially in Florida with its large number of Social Security recipients. The former Massachusetts governor combined hitting Perry on Social Security with an expansion of another criticism of the Texas governor Romney made at a previous debate at the Reagan Library in California, to  wit, that Perry's a flip flopper. It's one of the oldest tricks in politics, to neutralize your opponent's attack by accusing him of doing the exactly what you're accused of, making him seem hypocritical. And Perry has given Romney an opening for this by backpedaling from the full-throated indictment of Social Security he made in his book \"Fed Up.\" By contrast, Perry seemed flat literally from the start. He got the first question, from a small businessman who, via a YouTube video, asked Perry what he would do to \"incent\" a small business person like himself to hire. Brett Baier expanded on the question, asking why Perry, unlike the other candidates on the stage, didn't have a jobs plan. Perry basically said the equivalent of \"watch this space\" in terms of the plan. Then he essentially said Texas was his jobs plan, as if invoking the state's economic success was all the answer the small businessman who asked the question needed to be encouraged. For his part, Perry came prepared to be on offensive as well. He wanted to reinforce the view that Romney couldn't be trusted because of his reputation for shifting his positions with changes in the political winds. But Perry never really connected seriously with any of his attacks on Romney along this line. If there was a quintessential moment that captured how Perry's strategy failed, it was an exchange with Romney that occurred well into the debate. Perry seemed to lose his train of thought just at the moment when he was supposed to be delivering the coup de grace to Romney. GOV. PERRY:  I think Americans just don't know sometimes which Mitt Romney they're dealing with.  Is it the Mitt Romney that was on the side of \u2014 against the Second Amendment before he was for the Second Amendment?  Was it \u2014 was before \u2014 he was before the social programs from the standpoint of \u2014 he was for standing up for Roe versus Wade before he was against first \u2014 Roe versus Wade?  Him \u2014 he was for Race to the Top.  He's for \"Obamacare\" and now he's against it.  I mean, we'll wait until tomorrow and \u2014 and \u2014 and see which Mitt Romney we're really talking to tonight. It was a painful to watch. Romney, sensing Perry was on the debate ropes, said \"nice try\" and then went in for the kill: Governor Perry, you wrote a book six months ago.  You're already retreating from the positions that were in that book. Romney also got the best of Perry in an exchange over illegal immigration. Slamming Perry's support for a Texas version of the DREAM Act which allows the children of illegal immigrants to get in-state tuition, Romney said: I \u2014 I \u2014 I don't see how it is that a state like Texas --- to go to the University of Texas, if you're an illegal alien, you get an in-state tuition discount.  You know how much that is?  It's $22,000 a year.  Four years of college, you're \u2014 almost a $100,000 discount, if you're an illegal alien, to go to University of Texas. If you're a United \u2014 United States citizen from any one of the other 49 states, you have to pay $100,000 more.  That doesn't make sense to me.  And that kind of \u2014 that kind of magnet \u2014 (applause) \u2014 that \u2014 that kind of magnet draws people into this country to get that education, to get the $100,000 break.  It makes no sense. When he had his chance to respond, Perry said: ... But if you say that we should not educate children who have come into our state for no other reason than they've been brought there by no fault of their own, I don't think you have a heart.  We need to be educating these children because they will become a drag on our society. I think that's what Texans wanted to do. Judging from the boos from some in the audience and how most others sat on their hands, Perry lost this round, too, at least with the Republican primary electorate. Rick Santorum, the former U.S. senator from Pennsylvania, who has had some of the sharpest criticisms of Perry recently delivered yet another: MR. SANTORUM:  Governor Perry, no one is suggesting up here that-- that you're \u2014 the students that are illegal in this countryshouldn't be able to go to a college and university.  I \u2014 I thinkyou're sort of making this leap that unless we subsidize this \u2014 thetaxpayers subsidize it, they won't be able to go.  Well, most folkswho want to go to the state of Texas or any other state out of statehave to pay the full boat.  (Cheers, applause.)  The point is why arewe \u2014 not that \u2014 not that they can't go.  They can go.  They justhave to borrow money \u2014 find other sources to be able to go.  And \u2014 and \u2014 and why should they be given preferential treatment as \u2014 as an illegal in this country?  (Cheers, applause.)  That's what we'resaying. To this, Perry made the mistake sometimes seen in courtrooms of asking a question he didn't know the answer to. He indignantly asked Santorum if he had ever been to the Texas border, as if to say the Pennsylvanian didn't understand the issue. MR. SANTORUM:  Yes. GOV. PERRY:  I'm surprised if you have, but you weren't payingattention, because the idea -- MR. SANTORUM:  Well, the answer is yes. For many Republicans who have told pollsters that Perry is their top choice and who are turned off by Romney, the Texas governor's debate performance may not matter. They may want a conviction politician so much that they will pick Perry over Romney who has never been mistaken for one. But, given what they've seen so far, others must be asking themselves if Perry will be ready to go head-to-head with President Obama. Aside from the Perry-Romney duel, there was the unfinished business from the last debate of Rep. Michele Bachmann and the HPV vaccine. Baier asked the Minnesota congresswoman the inevitable question: did she still stand by her comment that a woman who approached her after the last debate had told her a daughter became \"mentally retarded\" after getting the HPV vaccine? Further, did she stand by her comment that the vaccine was dangerous even after medical authorities uniformly refuted her claim and called the congresswoman perilous to public health? Bachmann said don't shoot the messenger, then quickly pivoted to an attack on Perry's 2006 executive order that required 12-year old girls in Texas to receive the vaccine. REP. BACHMANN:  Well, first, I didn't make that claim, nor did I make that statement.  Immediately after the debate, a mother came up to me, and she was visibly shaken and heartbroken because of what her daughter had gone through, and so I only related what her story was. But here's the real issue.  Governor Perry mandated a health care decision on all 12-year-old little girls in the state of Texas... Perry defended himself by saying he had been lobbied on the issue by a 41-year old woman who had cervical cancer. According to reports, however, he met with the woman after he signed the executive order. As for the most memorable line of the evening, it came not from Perry, Romney or Bachmann or any of the other well known names on the stage but from Gary Johnson. The former New Mexico governor has been shut out of most other debates because he barely registers in national polls. To the question, what would he do to turn the country around, Johnson started with this: MR. JOHNSON:  My next-door neighbor's two dogs have created more shovel-ready jobs than this current administration. That brought the house down. After the laughter stopped he got serious. Balance the federal budget now. Not 15 years from now, not 20 years from now, but now.  And throw out the entire federal tax system, replace it with the fair tax, a consumption tax that by allmeasurements is just that; it's fair.  (Bell rings.)  It does away with corporate income tax.  If that doesn't create tens of millions of jobs in this country, I don't know what does.  (Cheers, applause.) Johnson's answer spoke to something about these pre-primary debates that happens to greater or lesser degrees in both parties. Because debates at this stage are about appealing to the party's base, many of the offered solutions have a fantasy element to them. What's the real likelihood that the federal budget running a $1.4 trillion deficit could be balanced \"now\" or that we would ditch the current tax system for a consumption tax? And where's the evidence that it would create tens of millions of jobs? And it wasn't just Johnson, who barely can get into the debates, who was guilty of this. As PolitiFact noted, Romney's accusation that Obama has gone around the globe apologizing for the U.S. just doesn't stand up to scrutiny. Indeed, after a fairly extensive scrub of the record, PolitiFact awarded its \"pants on fire\" grade because the charge is so brazenly fanciful. Also participating in the debate were Rep. Ron Paul of Texas, former House speaker Newt Gingrich, former pizza company executive Herman Cain, and former Utah governor Jon Huntsman. It was at the end of the debate that Paul had a chance to let the audience know, in case they hadn't noticed, that he had some momentum. When the candidates were asked by a voter via another YouTube video who on stage he or she might choose as a vice presidential pick, Paul said: I \u2014 I don't plan to make a choice at the moment because I am on national polls.  It seems like I'm in third place now. I think it would be inappropriate. As soon as \u2014 (applause) \u2014 as soon as I'm one of the two toptier, then I will start thinking along that line. Gingrich and Cain, through no fault of their own, became something of a weird thought experiment when Perry said he wished he could create a vice presidential pick by \"mating\" those two men. Meanwhile, Huntsman took the opportunity presented by the question to share what sounded like his daydreams. MR. HUNTSMAN:  You know, I'm tempted to say that when all is saidand done, the two guys standing in the middle here, Romney and Perry, aren't going to be around because they're going to bludgeon each other to death.  (Laughter.) But I'm also reminded of about four years ago, we had two front-runners in similar situations, one by the name of Rudy Giuliani, Ithink, and the other by the name of Fred Thompson.  They seemed to disappear altogether.  I can't remember where they went. All indications are that whereever they went, he's likely to join them.",

Michele Bachmann, former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney and Texas Gov. Rick Perry cover their hearts during the playing of the national anthem before a Republican presidential debate on Sept. 12. Wherever he goes, GOP presidential candidate Rick Perry proudly waves the flag of conservatism, often introducing himself with, \"I simply want to get America working again and make Washington,  D.C., as inconsequential in your life as I can.\" But the Texas governor, a favorite of conservatives overall, is taking criticism for being too moderate when it comes to immigration. The reason: In 2001, his first full year in office, he signed legislation that grants in-state tuition rates at Texas colleges and universities to some illegal immigrants. He was forced to defend that move at last week's CNN/Tea Party-sponsored debate in Tampa. \"If you are working and pursuing citizenship in the state of Texas, you pay in-state tuition there. And the bottom line is it doesn't make any difference what the sound of your last name is,\" he said. \"That is the American way.\" Perry's answer prompted boos from Tea Party activists in the audience. Opponents On The Offensive Minnesota Rep. Michele Bachmann compared Perry's Texas immigration policy to the federal DREAM Act, which is supported by the White House. That proposal would provide a path to legal U.S. residency for people who arrived in the U.S. illegally as minors and who meet certain conditions. And there was this from former Pennsylvania Sen. Rick Santorum: \"What Gov. Perry's done is he provided in-state tuition for illegal immigrants. Maybe that was an attempt to attract the illegal vote \u2014 I mean, the Latino voters.\" Former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney, considered the moderate among the top-tier GOP contenders, has also joined the attack. While Perry does call for a much stronger federal presence patrolling the U.S.-Mexico border, he opposes building a wall. Romney calls for a high-tech fence to be built, and he says, \"As governor, I vetoed legislation that would have provided in-state tuition breaks to illegal immigrants, and I strengthened the authority of our state troopers to enforce existing immigration laws.\" Focus On Latino Voters Perry's outreach to Latinos includes a meeting behind closed doors with Hispanic business leaders Monday in New York City. Among Latino voters, Democrats enjoy a tremendous edge. Mindful of that, the independent group American Crossroads, founded by former George W. Bush adviser Karl Rove, has run Spanish-language ads that keep the focus solely on President Obama and the economy. The message is about the impact the bad economy and the president's policies have had on Latino families. Such ads are a recognition that tough talk on immigration now can hurt the GOP nominee come the general election. But Matt Barreto, a Latino political analyst at the University of Washington, says even a focused economic message is still a very tough sell for Republicans with this group of voters. \"When we ask in our polling ... we find consistently that Latino voters tell us that they trust Obama and the Democrats at much higher rates, almost 3-1, than they do Republicans on fixing the economy,\" he says. \"When we go back to the Bush tax cuts, which President Obama extended, we found that Latino voters were opposed to that. They said they should have let them expire.\" But Roberto Suro of the Annenberg School at the University  of Southern California says the GOP goal is to discourage Latino voters who once supported Obama. He says they may not vote Republican, but you might get them to stay home. \"If you can move a fairly small percentage of Latino voters in the right places, you can have a big difference in the electoral college outcomes,\" Suro says. Look at New  Mexico, Colorado and Nevada, he says \u2014 all states that Obama carried in 2008, but also places where President Bush won four years earlier.  Each has a big Latino population. If Obama's total among those voters falls off significantly, that could be the difference between winning re-election or not.",

            "article_content": "The Barbershop guys weigh in on the NBA lockout that went into effect at midnight. They'll also discuss the Dream Act, and whether President Obama's stance on gay marriage has evolved. Host Michel Martin hears from author Jimi Izrael, conservative columnist Mario Loyola, Sports Illustrated reporter Pablo Torre and editorial director of Colorlines.com Kai Wright.  MICHEL MARTIN, host: I'm Michel Martin and this is TELL ME MORE from NPR News. JIMI IZRAEL: Thanks, Michel. Hey, fellas. Welcome to the shop. How are we doing? MARIO LOYOLA: Good morning. How are you guys? KAI WRIGHT: Lovely to be here. IZRAEL: All right. Well, let's get things started with the stoppage, the National Basketball Association lockout. Pablo, man, looks like pretty soon you'll be covering staring contests and beer pong tournaments if the NFL and the NBA continue... (SOUNDBITE OF LAUGHTER) PABLO TORRE: My college experience finally comes in. MARTIN: I was going to say - right? IZRAEL: I'm saying if they continue to be MIA, man, what's Sports Illustrated going to do, right? Well, last ditch talks broke down and the collective bargaining agreement between the players and the team owners, expired at midnight, Michel. MARTIN: Well, yeah. So, of course, we've talked about the National Football League. And now that's two major pro sports leagues shutting down. This is NBA commissioner David Stern. This is how he characterized the negotiations between players and team owners. Here it is. (SOUNDBITE OF PRESS CONFERENCE) DAVID STERN: We've got a huge philosophical divide. The players' perspective, as annunciated by their economists, says you've been happy losing money, you should continue to lose money. IZRAEL: Thanks for that, Michel. Wow. Profound stuff. Pablo. TORRE: Yeah. IZRAEL: Yeah, I know, right? They're trying to figure out how to work with the league's $4.3 billion in revenue. That's a lot of money. Break this down for us. What's the problem here? TORRE: Yeah. The problem is that the NBA owners are crying poor. I mean, we thought the NFL was bad in terms of the lockout stuff. The NFL is printing money. The NBA claims that 22 of 30 teams are losing it. And obviously there's some clever accounting involved there. But the bottom line is that basketball is, relative to the NFL, in a far, far worse place. So the NBA wants to be more like the insanely profitable NFL. They want smaller player salaries, non-guaranteed contracts, a hard salary cap. Basically all things that would save the owners from their own mistakes, right? These are all things that they can impose on themselves, but they can't seem to do it, so they want legislation in the collective bargaining agreement that says they cannot do it. And so right now, horribly enough, as Michel said, first time in history, actually, we have an NFL and NBA lockout simultaneously. And, honestly, we should prepare to cover tiddlywinks and beer pong. I mean, this is something that will last. At this point, the canyon is so big that it should last for an entire year, an entire season, which is a shame, obviously, given the interest level and the storylines you've been talking about for an entire year with LeBron James and all of that. And so, the NBA, yeah, it goes on and gets on the backburner and we get to cover, you know, clever accounting rules and labor law, which all sports fans love, obviously. MARTIN: But, Pablo, could you just clarify one thing for me? What's David Stern's role in this as commissioner? TORRE: Right. His role is, you know, the cynic will say his role is to answer to the owners and be their whipping boy, essentially. I mean, there's, I mean, realistically there is a certain minority of owner, numerically, who really, you know, the teams that aren't making a lot of money, the smaller market teams and, you know something? Actually, the Boston Celtics owner, Wyc Grousbeck, actually is in this group too. But basically there's a faction that wants to be like the NFL. And David Stern, his job is to, you know, right now he's aligning with them and he's basically doing their bidding - for better and for worse. MARTIN: But aren't the finances of the NBA more transparent than the NFL? I mean, isn't one of the issues in the - I guess what I'm asking is what's the difference between the two? TORRE: Exactly. That's true. MARTIN: Because one of the issues for the NFL players is that they're saying, open your books. TORRE: Right. MARTIN: You're crying poor. We think you're printing money, open your books. They're saying, not going to happen. Whereas, at least on the NBA side, do I have it right that they're - the finances are more transparent? TORRE: Completely. MARTIN: So at least they have a more good faith basis for their negotiations. TORRE: Completely. They do have the documentation. And David Stern, to his credit, has released all of that. The problem still is, you know, and I won't get into the minutia of accounting rules, which I've had to learn about, unfortunately in the past week. There are ways to talk about revenue. I mean, when you get a sports team, that is one aspect of a business. You also get the revenue from all the properties surrounding it. I mean, these companies, these billionaires are not - I mean, some of them are losing money, to be sure. Do I think 22 or 30 are claiming a loss in actual revenue, in real time money? I doubt that. And so it's a question of, you know, it's their right, at the bottom line - it's their right to make profit. It's a business. But are they as poor as they think they are? I think that's a dubious claim, to be sure. IZRAEL: Mm. All right. Thanks. Kai, you're going to be bummed if your Knicks don't take the court, man this fall? (SOUNDBITE OF LAUGHTER) WRIGHT: I think I'm going to go on quite the same. I'm looking forward to the coverage of the tiddlywinks. I think there might be something interesting there, you know. (SOUNDBITE OF LAUGHTER) IZRAEL: Somebody might get an eye put out of something there. WRIGHT: Yeah. You know. MARTIN: Curling. WRIGHT: Curling? MARTIN: You heard it here first. Curling. We're all going to have to learn curling. IZRAEL: Hackensack slaps, you know, we could just go on and on with extreme sports. Mario, what are your thoughts, man? LOYOLA: Well, I just keep thinking about what Winston Churchill had to say about the NBA lockout, and never have so few spent so much time arguing over so much money. IZRAEL: Yeah. (SOUNDBITE OF LAUGHTER) MARTIN: I don't remember him saying that. (SOUNDBITE OF LAUGHTER) IZRAEL: Yeah. Yeah. MARTIN: Are you sure you did? LOYOLA: Yeah, he, it's a little known quote. MARTIN: Okay. (SOUNDBITE OF LAUGHTER) IZRAEL: Evidently it is, right? TORRE: But that's an interesting point there. And this is Pablo just jumping back in. IZRAEL: Go ahead, Pablo. TORRE: I mean, sports fans love these games so much that players and owners despite their, whatever tensions they may have, they can hold this lockout for a year, two years. They know that we're not going to turn our backs on these games. I mean the NFL, the NBA they have to go so far to push and really revolt fans and make them not want to wait and pay for this product that they can really keep this going at least as far as the fan interest goes. So it's really between them. How much money do they think they can get out and right now they're actually finally at the bargaining table with these lockouts. IZRAEL: Well, I mean so you've got the mic, so what's the over and under? I mean how long do you think this thing will last? TORRE: I think this is going 365 days. I think this is going on for a year. IZRAEL: Really? WRIGHT: Wow. TORRE: I do. I do. And I - honestly I think we should get ready for that reality. We're not going to have the NBA. I think we will have an NFL season. It may be a little bit delayed but I think we'll get the NFL going because they are actually making a ton of money. And no NFL owner is claiming what the NBA owners are claiming. NBA owners... LOYOLA: And the Packers just won the Super Bowl. (SOUNDBITE OF LAUGHTER) IZRAEL: And there's - yeah. Right. LOYOLA: They've got to have a season. They just have to. We Packers fans, we've waited too long for this and, you know? (SOUNDBITE OF LAUGHTER) MARTIN: Mario, you're in Texas. TORRE: Yeah, what's that about? (SOUNDBITE OF LAUGHTER) MARTIN: You got the - what - I thought you had America's team, yo. What? LOYOLA: Yeah, but I went to the University of Wisconsin and the whole reason I'm in Texas is that I just want to live in Madison where it's, but for it to be warm all the time. (SOUNDBITE OF LAUGHTER) LOYOLA: And I found that in Austin. IZRAEL: The truth comes out. (SOUNDBITE OF LAUGHTER) TORRE: It's what they call Texas I believe, the Green Bay of the South. IZRAEL: Right. MARTIN: Another quote I've never heard but there you go. (SOUNDBITE OF LAUGHTER) MARTIN: If you're just joining us, you're listening to our weekly Barbershop segment. We're joined by author Jimi Izrael, Sports Illustrated reporter Pablo Torre, columnist Mario Loyola, and editor Kai Wright. Back to you, Jimi. IZRAEL: Thanks, Michel. Well, in happier news, New York state is open for business for same-sex marriages starting in about three weeks. The state legislature - wow, I got caught up in my tongue for some reason - last week approved gay marriage. So Kai, you're an openly gay New Yorker. How significant was this to you? WRIGHT: Well, it was a big weekend. I mean it came over a gay pride weekend at that. I managed to lose my voice and my phone in the course of the weekend. But I picked up a few rights so I'd say was a big wash. (SOUNDBITE OF LAUGHTER) WRIGHT: You know, I... MARTIN: But Kai, do you mind if I ask? I was talking to some of the younger folks on my staff. And I was saying to them look, let's recognize that there are a lot of people who still do not agree with this. But the other point is that a lot of the young people on my staff they don't remember what it's like to be told you can't do something because of who you are. They really don't. I mean they don't remember as girls being told no you can't be an astronaut, no you can't be in politics, no you can't do this. They don't remember as people of color, those are people of color, being told no, you know, you think you can be president but no you can't. And, you know, I just wonder is this the last thing that people are... WRIGHT: Oh, by no means. MARTIN: ...going to be told they can't do because of who they are. WRIGHT: There are many things that gay people are still told they cannot do. It should be told. MARTIN: Exactly. WRIGHT: You know, and there's a lot of, you know, class and race elements to this in terms of who this is going to be useful for. But I think for me there's a bigger picture, you know, I mean, because there's actually, you know, marriage - the whole marriage fight stirs just many emotions inside gay politics and inside gay communities as it does in the nation at large. You know, I mean there's a number of folks, and I've said it some myself, that feel like there's way too much resource put on this when you have things like thousands of gay kids sleeping in the street every night and no money from the state to deal with that. IZRAEL: Mm-hmm. WRIGHT: But the thing about this was, you know, if you are someone who believes in the broad definition of civil and human rights, someone who, as a gay person, believes that, you know, you deserve full access to all of this, there's been a lot of loss in the last like 15 years. And American politics is, let's be clear about winning and losing. And, you know, I've seen a lot of defeats and it was nice to win something. It was nice to see folks line up on each side of a political issue and have human rights win out. And that was a really big deal and I think you felt that in the streets of New York this past weekend. You just people felt like they were on the right side of history for once. TORRE: Completely. WRIGHT: And I think we can't underestimate the importance of that in the national dialogue. All the polling and all of the strategy laid to the side, we can't underestimate the experience of being on the right side of history for human rights for a state the size of New York. MARTIN: Well, can I ask Mario this because he's in a state that, you know, obviously Texas is very diverse but different points of view there. Mario, can I just get the view from there where you are? How does it strike you? LOYOLA: Well, I mean I don't really have an opinion one way or the other. I'm glad that people feel enfranchised and I think it's a good thing when they do. I think that a lot of Republicans, a lot of conservatives, a lot of family values conservative Christians feel somewhat betrayed by, you know, the fact that Republican, a Republican-controlled legislature in New York voted this out. And, you know, I think they want to preserve - what people are concerned about I think on the right is that this society has gotten too far away from family values and they penalize, you know, childrearing and raising children. And they're concerned that the society isn't encouraging the formation of families as much as it used to. I think that's what people are concerned about. But it's very good that people feel enfranchised. I mean, you know, congratulations, Kai. I mean I think it's a good thing and I have a lot of friends who are very happy about this and I guess I am too. MARTIN: Does anybody want - go ahead, Jimi. IZRAEL: Yeah, I mean you know how I feel about it, Michel. You know, I'm down for gay marriage. Not just because everyone deserves to love the way they want it, because but also because you'll never eat better than at a gay reception. (SOUNDBITE OF LAUGHTER) IZRAEL: This is a fact. I've been to a few, you will never eat quite so well. TORRE: Never eat better. IZRAEL: Right. Exactly. MARTIN: No stereotyping here, right? Okay. WRIGHT: We do a lot of things better. (SOUNDBITE OF LAUGHTER) IZRAEL: But what I'm really concerned about is our accommodationist-in-chief, you know, he's kind of, he's riding the middle again. He's not coming out for. He's not coming out against. You know, and I don't know. It's typical Obama. What you want from this guy, right? MARTIN: Well, let me just play a clip so people who aren't following this might know what he - in case you don't know what he's, what Jimi's talking about. He hosted an event honoring Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, and Transgender Pride Month at the White House on Wednesday. But when he was talking to reporters earlier he refused to endorse same-sex marriage, while at the same time kind of praising New York's state legislators for advancing the rights of gay and lesbian Americans. A little bit maybe of what Kai was talking about here, kind of threading the needle. But here's a clip. PRESIDENT BARACK OBAMA: ..TEXT: IZRAEL: Right up the middle. MARTIN: So is anybody else irritated like Jimi is, saying, you know, enough already with that? TORRE: How hollow was that? Jesus. LOYOLA: I mean what's really funny about that quote is Obama's slow process of discovering that the presidency is not about telling everyone what they must do. (SOUNDBITE OF LAUGHTER) IZRAEL: Shock, awe, right Mario? (SOUNDBITE LAUGHTER) WRIGHT: Well, but the presidency is in fact about having the bully pulpit to lead on particularly on moral issues and issues of great national divide. And, you know, I certainly, frankly, will say was offended for him to show up in New York the night before this deeply important vote where so many people, so many politicians in the states on both sides of the aisle were taking principled courageous stances. And to show up here to raise money from gay people and... IZRAEL: Right. WRIGHT: And to split hairs that way on something so important was offensive. But I also want to point out by the way, just going back a little bit on the whole family values question. You know, I think some of the people that are most excited about this ruling are gay families, who in fact, are raising children and trying to those families in the state has been actively standing in the way of their ability to have healthy happy families. So they're some of the most excited folks about this. MARTIN: I think we're going to talk more about this, like what exactly this means and what the fears are about what this does mean for families. I mean this is an issue it seems like the momentum is certainly in the direction of marriage equality. But there are I think it is still worth talking about so people can talk about what it is exactly that they are afraid of and concerned about. Before we let you go, another topic: immigration. Two interesting occurrences on that front recently. This, you know, everybody has said immigration reform is a nonstarter this year, it's too close to the election, no consensus, too many, you know, the jobs and so forth like that. But then there's a Senate hearing on something called the Dream Act, which would grant amnesty to some children whose parents brought them into the country illegally. And then there's the story of this journalist, Jose Antonio Vargas, many of us know him, he's certainly been on this program, who came out as an undocumented immigrant or somebody whose documents were false. He was brought to this country under false pretenses. And I'm just, you know, interested in what we people think about this. Do we think that the immigration debate is in fact alive now? I don't know. Who wants to take this? Jimi, what do you think? IZRAEL: Yeah, of course it is. I think as long as there's - I mean yeah, as long as we have a republic this debate will be alive because there are people that don't understand that this country was founded on immigration. And, you know, if you can't come to America to dream and to be somebody, where can you go? Canada? Really? Pablo? TORRE: Yeah? IZRAEL: What do you think? TORRE: Here's my thing on the Vargas situation. I thought what he did was incredibly brave and admirable, an incredibly well-written and well thought out essay first off. But the thing that kind of troubled by with sort of a tingeing of that argument is kind of - it's this idea that illegals can be successful people and elites also. Like don't, you know, we're not all strawberry pickers and all that. I mean to me I'm kind of like what does that matter, I mean, right? I mean like we're talking about an issue of principle, right? And we're talking about justice. Does it matter what kind of profession? Obviously it's good to nudge the public image, the public perception in one direction to show that there is a swath of people. But on principle should it matter that we're - that some illegal immigrants, some undocumented people rather, are sort of more successful than others? Does that matter versus the strawberry pickers? MARTIN: Mario? LOYOLA: Well, this is a really tough issue. The Dream Act in particular is a really tough issue. I mean we're trying to open up U.S. citizenship for illegal immigrants who attend college or serve in the military and, you know, it's people that came here as children and a lot of times they don't even speak the language of their country of origin anymore. And, you know, but I don't think that this has enough votes to pass in the Senate. I think that the reason Dick Durbin brought this up in the Senate is because it's so painful for Republicans. And, you know, when you're heading into an election cycle, if you want the Republicans - if you want to see Republicans go through pain and suffering, just bring up immigration. That's all you have to do. (SOUNDBITE OF LAUGHTER) MARTIN: You think it's a public policy shtick? LOYOLA: Yeah. But, I can't see myself... MARTIN: Do you support the Dream Act yourself? LOYOLA: Well, I, it's tough, you know, I mean I have to say it's the most sympathetic case of rewarding illegal behavior that I can think of. MARTIN: Something else we're going to be talking about. Okay. That was mario loyola - sorry to cut you off, but time is one thing they're not making more of.

He played a prominent role in ousting Serbia's dictator in 2000, and has worked with Arabs involved in uprisings in their countries during the past year.\n                \n                    \n                    Darko Vojinovic/AP\n                    \n                \nhide caption Srdja Popovic, who runs the Center for Applied Nonviolent Action and Strategies, speaks in Belgrade in February. He played a prominent role in ousting Serbia's dictator in 2000, and has worked with Arabs involved in uprisings in their countries during the past year. Srdja Popovic, a lanky biologist from Belgrade, helped overthrow a dictator in Serbia a decade ago. Since then, he's been teaching others what he learned, and his proteges include a host of Arab activists who have played key roles in ousting Arab autocrats over the past year. \"This is a bad year for bad guys,\" Popovic says with a broad grin in a New York cafe. The Arab uprisings, which began when a frustrated Tunisian fruit seller, Mohamed Bouazizi, set himself on fire last December, caught the world by surprise. Yet young would-be Arab revolutionaries had been beating a path to Belgrade since 2005,  learning Popovic's tactics of peaceful revolt and waiting for the moment when they could apply them. \"One hundred percent of the credit goes to those people. We equipped them with the tools for their struggle,\" he says. He insists that he didn't lead but rather taught pro-democracy activists tactics he developed as the founder of Otpor (Resistance), a nonviolent movement that helped drive out Serbian dictator Slobodan Milosevic in 2000. Now, he heads the Center for Applied Nonviolent Action and Strategies (CANVAS) in Belgrade. He is listed as one of the \"100 Most Important Global Thinkers\" by Foreign Policy magazine, and seen as an international troublemaker by autocrats in the Middle East. \"History proves there is a fair chance that most of the Arab world will end up in some kind of democracy,\" he says, while acknowledging the challenges posed by the turmoil in Egypt, where the military still holds power, and the violence in Syria, where many peaceful protesters have been killed. Training Egyptian Activists Egyptian activists first came to Belgrade in 2009. They had tremendous talent, says Popovic. Even then, he says, they planned for a democratic transition in Egypt. But once President Hosni Mubarak was gone, the movement lost its unity, a key tenet of nonviolent struggle, he says.  He questions the wisdom of trusting the Egyptian military leaders with the transition to democracy after the generals ushered Mubarak off the national stage. This is a bad year for bad guys. Srdja Popovic, of Serbia, who helped train Arab activists involved in uprisings this year \"This is the last authority you would ever give a transition; it's like giving the goat your cabbage to keep,\" he says. \"There is a lesson learned.\" Another lesson Popovic cites applies to the next phase of any successful revolution.  Once the dictator goes, the next stage is building institutions. \"The [fewer] institutions you have, the more turbulent it will be.\" As he's watched the Arab Spring turn into a more violent and uncertain season, Popovic places his hopes in the millions of Arabs who took part in successful nonviolent actions. \"This changes the way people see themselves,\" he says. \"They shift from passive to a very active person\" and become \"shareholders in the victory,\" he adds. Prospects For Tunisia To date, the best outcome is in Tunisia, where the regional revolt began. With an 86 percent turnout in the first free elections on Oct. 25, Tunisia appears to be on course for a successful transition to democracy. \"The number of women in parliament is bigger than in Serbia and in the U.S. Senate,\" says Popovic. But Tunisia is a small, relatively prosperous country, with a homogeneous population, and had the best chance for a soft landing. In other parts of the region, the challenges are mounting. Ethnic, tribal and sectarian divisions complicate transitions to democracy. Long years of autocratic rule corrupted institutions and have divided, undermined or wiped out civil society. \"My biggest depression came when I saw what happened in Libya,\" says Popovic. The combination of a violent uprising and an international intervention, tribal conflicts and the slaughter of Moammar Gadhafi in front of cellphone cameras was \"the worst-case scenario\" for a believer in the transformative power of a nonviolent struggle. Success With Nonviolence His own experience in Serbia, his involvement in successful pro-democracy movements in Georgia, Ukraine and the Maldives, plus academic studies have convinced him that nonviolent struggles have better outcomes than the violent kind. In a study of 130 conflicts over the past 100 years, nonviolent struggles are three times more likely to succeed in a democratic transition, he says. \"It's all about the numbers,\" he explains, saying it's crucial to engage from 2 to 5 percent of the population in an active, daily, nonviolent struggle. Violent struggle has a dismal outcome, according to research, with only a 5 percent chance of creating a democracy. This is why the developments in the Syrian uprising have alarmed him. The Syrian uprising was particularly inventive, he says. It's been a little bit of Egypt, a little bit of Serbia, as well as tactics that are purely Syrian. Organizers have employed songs and humor, developed unity and discipline, and crafted a message that delivered the numbers on the street. But as government forces continue to use force, with thousands of people killed, there is a growing part of the movement that favors using arms. \"My response to this is that it will destroy the movement,\" Popovic says. In Syria, a new force of army deserters has joined the rebellion, targeting army installations and intelligence centers. A protest movement that was largely peaceful in the early months of the rebellion is sliding toward a more violent conflict. For Popovic, violence changes the outcome and drives those \"stakeholders of the victory\" off the streets. \"When the bullets start whistling, everybody stays home, and I hope that Syrians understand this,\" he cautions. The anniversary of the Arab uprisings will be marked on Dec. 17, the day that Bouazizi, the young Tunisian fruit seller, doused himself with gasoline. He later died of his wounds, but is credited with setting off the regional revolt. However, the recent revolutions can also trace their roots to groups of young Arab dreamers who met with a successful revolutionary in Belgrade.",

            "article_content": "German Chancellor Angela Merkel says Europe's economic turmoil is the continent's greatest crisis since World War II. But critics say she has been doing too little and lacks a bold vision for solving Europe's problems.\n                \n                    \n                    Sean Gallup/Getty Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption German Chancellor Angela Merkel says Europe's economic turmoil is the continent's greatest crisis since World War II. But critics say she has been doing too little and lacks a bold vision for solving Europe's problems. European leaders gather in Brussels Thursday night for the  start of their latest summit effort to save the eurozone from crushing debt  that now threatens the global economy. All eyes will be on  German Chancellor Angela Merkel, who is looking to build support for efforts to get nations to submit  their economies to greater scrutiny and fiscal discipline. Merkel's approach to the debt crisis currently roiling Europe has been calm, logical, methodical and \u2014 according to detractors, especially outside Germany, too slow and unimaginative. Critics are seething that she insists on austerity as the main medicine for debt-ridden southern neighbors while she offers no new ideas for growth and fiercely resists efforts to let the European Central Bank intervene more. Merkel has also flatly rejected collectivizing eurozone debt through so-called  \"euro bonds.\" She has called Europe's debt morass the continent's biggest crisis since World War II. But in a speech to the German Parliament recently, she  likened the  effort to find a lasting solution to  \"a marathon,\" not a  quick sprint. \"The government has constantly made it  clear that the European  debt crisis cannot be fixed overnight in one  fell swoop. There isn't one simple  solution,\" Merkel said. As leader of Europe's strongest economy, Merkel is \"the decider.\" She'll play a key role at the Brussels summit that some say will decide the fate of the euro. And the intensity of opinions about her underscores the fact  that she is now one of the most powerful figures on the world stage. Long-Term Approach Or Dithering? So far, though, many would say Merkel has done very little tough decision-making. \"The German leadership has been jumping from crisis to crisis, and too little, too late. And her leadership, I think, has been very disappointing,\" says Gayle Allard, an economist at IE Business School in Madrid. Even the Polish \u2014 who still harbor deep mistrust of their neighbor  \u2014 are calling for more daring leadership from Berlin. In an astonishing  comment for a senior Polish official, Foreign Minister Radoslaw  Sikorski recently told a Berlin audience that the biggest security  threat to his nation is \"the collapse of the eurozone.\" \"I will  probably be the first Polish foreign minister in history to say so,\"  Sikorski said, \"but here it is: I fear German power less than I am  beginning to fear German inactivity. You have become Europe's  indispensable nation.\" Allard says Merkel should communicate to the German people how much their export-dependent economy has gained from the euro and how its banks are partly to blame for the crisis by aggressively lending to their southern neighbors. In an undated photo from the early 1990s, Merkel, then Germany's minister for women and youth, is shown beside Chancellor Helmut Kohl. Unlike Kohl, Merkel did not live through World War II and was not shaped by history in the same way as her predecessor.\n                \n                    \n                    AP\n                    \n                \nhide caption In an undated photo from the early 1990s, Merkel, then Germany's minister for women and youth, is shown beside Chancellor Helmut Kohl. Unlike Kohl, Merkel did not live through World War II and was not shaped by history in the same way as her predecessor. \"I think there is maybe fear \u2014 fear of telling the truth to German citizens that if the euro founders, it's going to hurt German industry badly. German industry has benefited enormously, and the slowdown right now in Germany is due to the crisis in their export markets on the periphery in Europe,\" she says. But Elmar Brok, a member of the European Parliament and of Merkel's Christian Democratic Union, says the German chancellor is using the crisis as an opportunity to reshape European fiscal policy more in tune with German postwar sensibilities of frugality, caution and historical fear of inflation. \"She wants to have a long-term solution, not a cheap way [out]. And this is sometimes difficult in politics, which look for the next election date,\" Brok says. Ferdinan Fichtner, a leading German economist, warns that there is a huge danger in prioritizing improving the European Union's fiscal structure that led the eurozone crisis.   \"I fully agree with her this is necessary. But I think now is not the time to change the institutional setup,\" Fichtner says. \"This is a risky game given that the crisis could change and turn into a major banking crisis within days.\" Critics call Merkel's long-term approach dithering. And that cautious, methodical approach is rooted in her personality as well as her political and personal background. Logical And Unpretentious Merkel is a bit of an anomaly as leader of the CDU, a party deeply influenced by Catholic social teachings with its core support traditionally in western Germany. By contrast, she is the daughter of a Protestant minister who grew up in the then-Communist east of the country and trained to be a physicist before entering politics. Merkel biographer Gerd Langguth says her family had two cars and traveled relatively freely between East and West Germany, leading him to conclude that her pastor father had what he calls a \"sympathetic relationship\" with the Communist dictatorship. He says little in her orderly upbringing suggests she is capable of truly courageous leadership. \"She is not a dreamer, she is not a historian. She does not have big visions. She does not like to create big pictures of the future. She is a step-by-step decision-maker,\" he says. Langguth finds the popular image of Merkel as charismatically challenged and aloof unfair. She is a logical, unpretentious woman, he says, who still lives in the same apartment with her husband \u2014 a chemist who abhors media or public attention \u2014 that she did before becoming chancellor. Yet Langguth says Merkel was not shaped by history the way her CDU predecessors Konrad Adenauer and Helmut Kohl were. As chancellor, notes Langguth, Kohl would sprinkle speeches with personal memories of hardship, of American aid in the rough years after the war. His late wife had been raped by the Red Army and thrown out a window as a preteen. Experience shaped Kohl's efforts to build a united Europe and strong trans-Atlantic relationship. \"Helmut Kohl was much more European by heart,\" says Langguth. \"He knew what European unity means because he lived during World War II.\" Despite Criticisms, Embraced By Most Germans But for Merkel, Langguth says, the European project is much more a rational and matter-of-fact decision. She was born in 1954, nine years after the war, and learned about the conflict in school. It was an ideologically loaded communist curriculum, the biographer notes, which glorified so-called anti-fascist fighters, downplayed atrocities and sidestepped the full historical picture. \"It was not treated in the political and civic education in the same manner as in Western Germany. And of course, younger people do not feel personally responsible for World War II and for the Holocaust. So the experience never made [an impact on] Angela Merkel in her youth.\" She is acutely aware of the European sensitivities toward a powerful, resurgent, economically dominant Germany, Langguth says, but adds that she may not appreciate it the same way as her predecessors did. Merkel often says that \"if the euro fails, so does Europe.\" But some wonder if she really feels the weight of history and her crucial role at this moment. As one biographer put it, in her years in power, Merkel has not made a single truly memorable speech. Yet that may not matter: A majority of Germans embrace their even-keeled chancellor. Her personal approval rating today remains near 60 percent, and more than half of her fellow Germans say they trust her to guide Europe out of the crisis.",

Many white Americans now believe that they are victims of racial bias more often than African-Americans are. That's the upshot of a recent study from the Harvard Business School and Tufts University. Black people surveyed did not share that point of view. So what do African-Americans \u2014 especially the most privileged \u2014 think about the current state of race relations and their prospects for the future? Two award-winning journalists \u2014 former Newsweek columnist Ellis Cose and Washington Post Columnist Eugene Robinson \u2014 have explored this question in their recent work. Cose writes about it in his new book The End of Anger: A New Generation's Take On Race and Rage. His conclusions are influenced by two elaborate surveys he conducted: one with 200 black Harvard MBAs, and another with more than 300 graduates of A Better Chance, a program founded in 1963 that sends minority children to elite high schools across the U.S. Ellis Cose is a former columnist and contributing editor (1993 through 2010) for Newsweek magazine and former chairman of the editorial board and editorial page editor of the New York Daily News.\n\n                    \n                    Steven Kramer\n                    \n                \nhide caption Ellis Cose is a former columnist and contributing editor (1993 through 2010) for Newsweek magazine and former chairman of the editorial board and editorial page editor of the New York Daily News. In his conversation with Tell Me More host Michel Martin, Cose says, \"One thing that's very interesting about the younger cohort is not only have their experiences been different in terms of what they've had to deal with when it comes to racial animus, but their associations have been different.\" In other words, the whites they interact with are different from the whites their parents dealt with. Today, many middle class blacks associate with whites who, since little on, have been taught that all people should be treated equally. Cose originally focused on these issues in 1994 in his best-seller The Rage of a Privileged Class. Cose explains that, when he interviewed African-American subjects for that book, they felt that regardless of how hard they worked or what credentials they accumulated, they could not break the glass ceiling. But in the years since that book was published, many African-Americans have risen higher, notably former Secretary of State Colin Powell and President Barack Obama. With those accomplishments in mind, Cose says young black men and women still see discrimination, but feel that they can overcome those challenges to achieve professional growth and success. At the end of Cose's new book, readers find a section entitled \"Black Harvard MBAs Share Their Rules For Success.\" Rule 10:  \"Never talk about race (or gender) if you can avoid it, other than to declare that race (or gender) does not matter.\" Cose explains \"The point is not that you can't talk about being black. The point is you can't gripe about being black.\" He observes that, when black people complain about discrimination, others are inclined to see them as crybabies or marginalize them. The Washington Post Columnist Eugene Robinson is the winner of the 2009 Pulitzer Prize for Commentary. Robinson won for his columns on the 2008 presidential campaign focusing on the election of the first African-American president.\n                \n                    \n                    Anonymous/Pulitzer Board\n                    \n                \nhide caption The Washington Post Columnist Eugene Robinson is the winner of the 2009 Pulitzer Prize for Commentary. Robinson won for his columns on the 2008 presidential campaign focusing on the election of the first African-American president. Eugene Robinson sees the issues of race and class differently. His recent book is Disintegration: The Splintering of Black America. He tells Michel Martin that he began investigating race in America because of his \"nagging\" sense that when people talked about black America, they were having a conversation \"that went nowhere because we weren't talking about anything real.\" Robinson says that, by looking into academic and marketing studies and talking to people, he finds four distinct black Americas divided by education and culture. He further argues that, in order to have an intelligent conversation about race, there is some objective information that must be considered, including correlations between being black and poor, and being black and incarcerated. He adds, \"There's a sector of black America that hasn't made it to the middle class; that is less likely to make that leap now than in decades past, and that we're losing and that can't be allowed to happen.\" Cose agrees that despite progress and hope, the civil rights movement has unfinished business. He believes part of that is figuring out how to argue for equality in a way that transcends race. \"We're going to have a movement that is interlaced with race, but I think more and more is going be driven by issues of disparity,\" says Cose.",

From Connecticut to California, new regulations to be enacted on  July 1, when most states begin a new fiscal year, will change how people live in  ways big \u2014 Illinois is repealing its death penalty law \u2014 and small \u2014 California is mandating carbon monoxide detectors. While each state has distinct needs, legislation approved  across the nation addresses many of the same issues, such as budget shortfalls,  immigration, voter eligibility, health care and workers'  rights. Connecticut will start taxing yoga sessions on July 1.\n                \n                    \n                    iStockphoto.com\n                    \n                \nhide caption In this nascent economic recovery,  many states found ways to raise revenue without taking the politically suicidal  step of raising taxes. So, people may not see more money removed from their  paychecks, but they will shell out more at the cash register in the form of  higher sales taxes. For instance, Connecticut residents will be taxed on yoga  sessions, manicures and even valet parking. (Unlike other states, Connecticut didn't flinch  in imposing the largest tax increase in state  history.) \"The key issue has been money and  budgets. Everybody is dealing with that,\" says William Pound, executive director of  the nonpartisan National Conference of State Legislatures. \"It has been  through reductions or increases in fees. Like raising tuition at higher  education institutions, or fees at state parks. We're putting more of the cost  of the service on the individual using it rather than on the taxpaying public at  large.\" Immigration was another common  target. More than 1,500 related bills and resolutions were introduced in state  legislatures this year, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures.  By the end of March, 26 states had enacted 63 laws addressing the education and  employment of illegal immigrants, human trafficking or enforcement of existing laws. Here's a sampling of new laws taking effect Friday: Immigration:  Crackdowns And Expansions Job candidates in  Georgia now face felony charges for  submitting false information and documents to potential employers. That's the only major  provision in the new state law that takes effect Friday. The other provisions,  which include allowing local police to verify a suspect's immigration status and  detain them, are under temporary injunction by a federal judge as part of a lawsuit aimed  at overturning the law. On Sept. 1, a similar law takes  effect in Alabama. That state's version is regarded as  the strictest in the nation in part because it requires public schools to  determine the immigration status of pupils. On the other side of the immigration  divide, Illinois will enact its version of the DREAM  Act (Development, Relief and Education for Alien Minors), becoming the first  state to establish a private scholarship fund for the children of illegal immigrants. And, in Connecticut, illegal immigrants who are high school graduates will be eligible for in-state tuition at state colleges. A  similar law passed in Maryland and was scheduled to take effect  Friday but likely won't because of an ongoing petition drive aimed at forcing a  voter referendum to overturn it. Both laws require students to be on a path to  gaining legal status. Digital Don'ts:  Gabbing, Bullying And Sexting Connecticut raised fines for talking on a cellphone and texting while driving. A first offense will cost $125, up from $100, a  second offense between $150 and $250, and future citations could reach $400. Connecticut also banned school bullying, both  in person and virtually, via the Internet and digital  devices. Florida eased punishments for minors caught  \"sexting,\" the practice of sending lewd photos via text message. The law, aimed  at protecting children from prosecution for more serious crimes such as child  pornography, imposes a $60 fine or eight hours of community service for  first-time offenders. A second violation is a first-degree  misdemeanor. Dead  People Do Vote ... Others Must Show  ID In Virginia, if you send in  an absentee ballot but die before Election Day, your vote still will be  counted. In Oklahoma, voters now must  present identification at the polls. Separately, new voter ID legislation was  introduced in 20 states and passed in Kansas  and Wisconsin,  where the laws will take effect in 2012. Pot Or Not Minnesota outlawed synthetic marijuana,  otherwise known as K2 or Spice. These herbs are  sprayed with synthetic chemicals that mimic the effects of the real stuff, and  were sold in stores with no restrictions as incense or potpourri. Connecticut went in the other direction,  eliminating criminal prosecution for adults caught with up to half an ounce of  marijuana. The offense now carries a fine, and no jail time. In Virginia, patrons may be  allowed to bring their own wine to restaurants. The law is voluntary, leaving  the decision up to the individual restaurant. Establishments can also charge a  fee for corkage. Miscellaneous:  Hog Huntin' And California  Carpooling Those rugged types in  the woods of south Georgia who use bait to hunt deer and wild hogs now will be permitted to move as  close as they'd like to their prey. Previously, they had to remain 200 yards  away and hidden. Drivers of hybrid vehicles might  start hunting for the off-ramp in California, now that they no longer can travel  solo in HOV lanes. The ban affects some 85,000 motorists with vehicles that run  on a combination of gasoline and electricity. HOV access for solo drivers now will shift to  vehicles entirely powered by electricity and natural  gas.",

            "article_content": "President  Obama plans to pivot this week from foreign affairs and the targeted killing of  terrorist Osama bin Laden to a domestic issue that continues to bedevil his  administration: comprehensive immigration reform. Or the lack  thereof. Given the  expectations preceding the president's scheduled speech Tuesday in El Paso, Texas, on immigration  reform and border security, a comprehensive overhaul appears as elusive as the  Sept. 11 mastermind proved to be. Politicos \u2014  even those in the president's own party \u2014 are largely ignoring the Texas  messaging effort, and Hispanic leaders are taking what can charitably be  described as a wait-and-see attitude. \"Latinos  see the disjunction between the rhetoric and the reality of what the  administration is saying about immigration, and what they're doing about  immigration,\" says Sylvia Manzano, a political science professor at Texas A&M University. Most groups polled support providing a path to citizenship for illegal immigrants currently in the country, and stronger enforcement of measures to keep the undocumented out. Source: Pew Research Center Credit: NPR Source: Pew Research Center Credit: NPR \"He brought  up reform; he campaigned on it,\" she says, yet the situation has, in many ways,  worsened under his watch. Bipartisan  congressional efforts have hit dead ends, hung up in large part on how or  whether the estimated 11 million immigrants living here illegally should be  offered a path to citizenship. States such  as Arizona and Indiana have been taking immigration  enforcement into their own hands. Arizona Gov. Jan Brewer announced Monday that she plans  to appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court to overturn a lower court ruling barring  some of the more controversial aspects of her state's new immigration  law. And the  administration's stepped-up deportation efforts have both angered Latino groups  and been dismissed as too little by critics like Dan Stein of the Federation for  American Immigration Reform. \"The  president is going to El  Paso to engage in political theatrics,\" Stein asserts.  \"It's a cynical attempt to drive a wedge between the Hispanic voter and the rest  of America.\" Ethnic  Politics Obama's  renewed engagement on immigration reform is destined to be seen through a  political lens. In the  weeks since he announced he would run for re-election, the president has met with  members of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus. He held a White House meeting with  what even some Latino critics characterized as a \"celebrity brigade\" that  included actress Eva Longoria. More events are planned this  month. Last week,  the Justice Department's civil rights division sent a letter to schools  reminding them that children are entitled to a public education no matter the  citizenship or immigration status of their parents. And the department also  recently moved to suspend the deportation of an illegal immigrant in a same-sex  relationship recognized by a  legal civil union in New  Jersey. \"This is a  massively political issue,\" says Stein, whose organization advocates for  significant reductions in immigrants allowed into the country, including the  elimination of what critics refer to as \"chain immigration\" that allows, for  example, family reunification in the United States. \"I don't  think there's a possibility for any bipartisan agreement because there's no  communication going on between the two sides,\" he says. \"The entire immigration  debate has come to a screeching halt.\" Glimmer Of  Hope At the  liberal Center for American Progress, immigration expert Angela Kelley writes  that she sees an opportunity for the president to \"present a careful assessment  of what more is needed\" to ensure a \"functional border\" and sound immigration  policy. The center  in the past has estimated that it would take $300 billion and 200,000 buses to  undertake mass deportation of immigrants living in the U.S.  illegally. She and  other advocates for reform that includes a path to citizenship for illegal  immigrants have been pointing to a recent Pew Research  Center poll that showed 72  percent of those surveyed favored such a path. According  to Pew, Americans of all political persuasions \u2014 with the exception of staunch  conservatives \u2014 favored the notion that illegal immigrants who \"pass background  checks, pay fines and have jobs\" be given an opportunity to work toward  citizenship. Staunch  conservatives were sharply divided, with 49 percent endorsing a path and 49 percent  opposed. Opponents  of such a path call it tantamount to amnesty and have resisted efforts to move  on reform until the border is secured. Kelley and others argue that securing the  border, an inherently difficult and imperfect undertaking, should not be a  prerequisite to reform. The same  Pew poll also showed overwhelming support for stronger enforcement of  immigration laws, even among those surveyed whom Pew identified as \"solid  liberals.\" Democrats'  Problem But another  measure that Democrats have been closely watching is the softening of Latino  support not just for Obama but for the Democratic Party as a  whole. Though  nearly 70 percent of Latinos call themselves Democrats, according to Latino  Decisions, a polling and research firm, only 38 percent say they find the party  \"very welcoming\" to Latinos. In  recent days, members of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus called for  a  moratorium on the president's \"Secure Communities\" deportation  effort, asserting  that it has strayed from its stated intent of  targeting illegal immigrants who  have committed serious crimes. In 2008, 67  percent of Latinos voted for Obama, and 31 percent voted for the GOP  presidential nominee, Arizona Sen. John McCain. Manzano,  the Texas A&M professor, said that she sees the soft Hispanic support as  more problematic in 2012 for down-ballot Democrats than for the  president. \"I don't  think this is specifically about President Obama,\" she said. \"But there's a  long-standing relationship with the Democratic Party, which has not been  particularly responsive or attentive to Latinos.\" She noted  that Democrats controlled both the Senate and the House last year when the DREAM  Act failed. The legislation would have provided children of illegal immigrants a  path to citizenship through college or the  military. \"Today, I  don't know that Barack Obama has a strong opponent,\" she says. \"Given where we  are, Obama is not the one who needs the Latino  votes.\" But, she  says, if Latinos don't come out to vote for president next year, they're also  not coming out for Senate, House, state legislature and county commissioner  races, either. Though the  president will have an interested audience for his speech Tuesday, the prospect  that immigration reform will move forward in any appreciable way under his  current watch is unlikely. But then,  most Americans had, as of last year, pretty much given up hope that the  terrorist who had eluded capture for nearly a decade after he masterminded the  Sept. 11 attacks would ever be found.",

President's origin has once again been questioned in a resurgence of the \"birther\" controversy. Mary C. Curtis is a Charlotte, N.C.-based journalist and a contributor to The Root. It's not surprising to get involved in a heated discussion about race when you're strolling through a museum exhibit called \"Race: Are We So Different?\" And wouldn't you know that President Barack Obama would get caught right in the middle of it. Not all charges that the president isn't who he says he is come from Donald Trump's \"Birther\" fantasies or a California GOP official's crude email. A young mother and fan had her own issues with Obama when we talked while strolling through the latest attraction at Discovery Place, Charlotte,  N.C.'s hands-on science museum. \"Race: Are We So Different?\" \u2014 with its science-based displays showing that human beings are more alike than any other living species, and its assertion that no one gene or set of genes can support the idea of race \u2014 shouldn't be controversial or particularly revelatory. That the exhibit, in fact, reveals how invested so many people are in racial differences and in the ranking of one race over another. The show \u2014 which closes May 8 \u2014 has inspired discussions by school and business groups in a city with an African-American mayor whose residents have nonetheless scored low on measures of trust among the races. The mother, with a young daughter at her side and a son in a stroller, couldn't contain her disappointment \u2014 anger, even \u2014 that the president had marked \"black\" instead of indicating \"biracial\" or one in the long list of multiracial alternatives on the 2010 census form. She was white; her husband \u2014 not in attendance that day \u2014 was black. And their children were the reason she was upset at the president of the United States and why it was personal. \"He's president. He could have been an example,\" she insisted. I tentatively engaged her. Since she and her children had the right to choose, wasn't it hypocritical for her to criticize others for their choices? And since \u2014 as the exhibit around us made clear \u2014 race is an uneven line that has shifted throughout history, depending on political and economic expediency, why does a check mark on a page matter so much? Suppose, at some later date, one or both of her children checked \"black\" on that census form. Would she love them any less? I asked her. Her face turned red and she walked away. And although I had not raised my voice, I admit that the exchange could have been smoother. (I do hope she comes up with a better response by the time her kids start to ask questions, because \u2014 social construct or not \u2014 I don't think a multiracial paradise is going to arrive by the time they hit middle school.) Though Barack Obama never made his race a part of his presidency, he has become a national Rorschach test on the topic just by being. His election did not ease America into a postracial utopia, as a few dreamers had hoped. Instead, his very eligibility to hold the office has become an issue. A recent poll found that 45 percent of Republicans believe that the president was not born in the United States, despite confirmation of his citizenship by officials in his birth state of Hawaii. It's not a stretch to link an uncertain economy and census figures that show an increasingly black and brown America to efforts to paint Obama as \"the other.\" (Would the election of a president whose parent was born not in Kenya but, rather, a European country have launched the same conspiracy theories and proposed state legislation forcing future presidential candidates to prove their citizenship?) Others turn his self-identification as black into a rejection of his white mother and grandparents. It's a shame that Obama has to take on yet another of the country's challenges, one that existed before he was born (in America) and will persist long after he leaves office. The poor guy has to deal with the budget \u2014 and this, too?",

Once, when you looked in the dictionary to find \"most popular Republican in Indiana,\" a photo of Richard Lugar would invariably pop up. And why not?  He has won six Senate elections, more than any other Hoosier in history.  In fact, in 2006, the last time he was on the ballot, Democrats didn't even put up a candidate against him.  True, he has never been Mr. Warmth, and never wowed crowds with his speaking style.  But he is hard working, bright, soft spoken, respectful and, though this is now in dispute, conservative. It wasn't always in dispute. Yes, he does have a history of bipartisanship, and yes, he has voted for environmental protection and gun control legislation, issues anathema to the right.  But for the most part, he was a reliable member of the Senate's conservative wing; CQ's Politics in America 1996 noted that only three Senate Republicans supported President George H.W. Bush more than he, and that his average score from the liberal Americans for Democratic Action was only a \"10\" (out of a hundred) over his career. But that view may no longer be widely shared in Indiana.  Amy Kremer of the Tea Party Express \u2014 the same group that was behind the primary upsets of Joe Miller in Alaska and Christine O'Donnell in Delaware in 2010 \u2014 earlier this month called Lugar the \"epitome of what is wrong in Washington, D.C.\": Enough  is enough - Dick Lugar voted for the bailouts.  He then voted against the bill  that would have refunded the unused TARP bailout funds back to taxpayers.  He  voted for the big government SCHIP program.  He criticized those who were  opposed to earmarks.  He supports  amnesty.  He was given the grade of \"F\" by Gun Owners of America. As we here at the Tea  Party Express prepare to unveil our Target List for the 2012 elections, it is  clear that someone like this needs to go. And then, on Tuesday, state Treasurer Richard Mourdock announced he would challenge Lugar in the May 2012 primary, saying he is supported by three-quarters of the state's GOP county chairs.  On his Web site, Mourdock listed a slew of issues where he and the senator differ:  on President Obama (Lugar \"has been cited\" as Obama's \"favorite Republican\"), on Supreme Court nominees (he voted for Obama's \"liberal activist\" Supreme Court nominees Sotomayor and  Kagen ), on illegal immigration (Lugar \"has repeatedly voted for amnesty\"), on abortion (Lugar voted for federally funded research on human embryos), on gun rights, \"Obama Care,\" the auto industry bailout, TARP, earmarks, you name it. Lugar was derided as Nixon's \"favorite mayor\" during his unsuccessful 1974 Senate bid against Democratic incumbent Birch Bayh.\n                hide caption (As for being \"President Obama's favorite Republican\" \u2014 you cannot help but love the irony of that.  When he first ran for the Senate, against incumbent Birch Bayh in the Watergate year of 1974, his Democratic opponents taunted him for being President Nixon's \"favorite mayor,\" which Nixon did say during Lugar's tenure as Indianapolis' chief executive.) Mourdock is not the only Hoosier Republican with eyes on the Senate seat.  But the Tea Party folks are cognizant of what happened in 2010, when two conservatives \u2014 Marlin Stutzman and John Hostettler \u2014 took on establishment favorite Dan Coats, a former senator who is probably considered even more conservative than Lugar, in the primary.  Coats won with just 40 percent of the vote, with Stutzman and Hostettler splitting much of the rest.  Conservatives don't want to make that mistake again, and are holding a caucus in June, with the goal of uniting against one conservative challenger. Many are intrigued about how Lugar is dealing with this challenge.  There was a good story in Politico earlier this week that talked about the two different strategies being taken by Lugar and another Senate GOP veteran who may have run afoul of the right, Utah's Orrin Hatch.  Hatch, mindful of how the Tea Party took out fellow Utah Sen. Robert Bennett (R) at the 2010 state convention, has done everything he can to \"prove his conservative bona fides.\"  Lugar, on the other hand is \"defiant,\" someone who \"pokes fingers in the eyes of his critics on the right\": Other than a two-hour meeting with tea party leaders in  Indianapolis in December, Lugar has shown little sign of recalibrating his  support for TARP, the DREAM Act, President Barack Obama's Supreme Court nominees  or anything else that has the conservative grass roots roiling. That's why when the Tea Party Express recently announced its first Senate  targets of 2012, Lugar made the list but Hatch did not. \"Honestly, I'm shocked that Lugar has been so defiant, because November  wasn't that long ago,\" said Tea Party Express Chairman Amy Kremer. \"He's digging  in his heels and going to fight us. It makes you want to defeat him even more.  It also angers activists across the country, so it has the potential of becoming  a nationwide race where conservatives everywhere want to defeat him.\" While Lugar is sending the message that, after six terms in the Senate, he  won't kiss the tea party's ring \u2014 or anything else \u2014 it's not entirely clear  that his approach is working. On Tuesday, Indiana state Treasurer Richard  Mourdock formally announced his intention to challenge the senator in a 2012  primary. Mourdock claimed to have already secured the support of 77 percent of  the state's GOP county chairmen \u2014 a stunning figure, if true, against an  incumbent of Lugar's stature. At the end of their recent column praising Lugar, journalists Steve and Cokie Roberts wrote this:  \"His critics say Indiana can 'do better' than its senior senator, but they  have it exactly wrong. Congress doesn't need fewer Dick Lugars. It needs more of  them.\"  But the senator, who turns 79 in April, may feel that having to prove his conservative bona fides is beneath him.  Still, he has to realize that this is a completely different Republican Party electorate than the one that sent him to the Senate six times.  This is not a challenge that should be immediately dismissed. Experts weigh in. I asked some Indiana political analysts for their take.  Here were some of their responses: Brian Howey, publisher of the \"Howey Politics Indiana\" newsletter: Clearly there is a movement afoot whether it is the Tea Party or rural Republicans skeptical of internationalism and doesn't want to negotiate with President Obama. To them, \"compromise\" is a dirty word. Lugar's career in public service is all about compromise. Mourdock's candidacy is just one more coming across America in waves where the political center is in the crosshairs. Lugar has much work to do to attain a seventh term. Mourdock, however, is facing the best political organization in modern Indiana times, and the most prolific Republican vote-getter in history. And this race is still 15 months away. There is much definition left. One thing worth noting:  When Evan Bayh announced he was leaving the U.S. Senate in 2010, he lamented the  lack of \"bipartisanship.\"  When Mourdock declared his challenge to Lugar, he blamed  \"bipartisanship\" for the current state of affairs. Former Rep. Mark Souder (R): My biggest fear is that the Indiana  Tea Party thinks it is bigger than it is but Lugar just is so defiant that I  think he may be in real trouble.  Mourdock has a chance but there's still a long way to go.  I  have not seen [Mourdock's] list of county chairman but would assume they are mostly the  smaller,  less populated counties and not the Indianapolis area (58% of the primary vote   is Indy TV).  But the key thing is this: if Lugar keeps sticking his   finger in the eyes of Republicans, Mourdock, who has been everywhere in  Indiana, will be in place for the huge upset. Jim Shella, political reporter for WISH-TV in Indianapolis: Party leaders admit that Lugar has not done enough  to stay in touch with county chairmen and the state Republican Committee in  recent years, but he has universal name identification and widespread respect.   He has also built networks outside the party with, among other things, an annual  seminar for leading high school students, the Lugar Series (political training  for Republican Women).  Lugar has vulnerabilities but will be tough to  beat. Brian Vargus, PhD Professor, Political Science, Indiana University,  Indianapolis: Murdoch is more noise than substance but his supporters will show up in the  primary. Lugar has a substantial war chest \u2014 much more than Murdoch. He knows he  has to get his base out. Note than Govenor Daniels has endorsed [Lugar].  Bet Lugar  to win, especially big in Fall. Murdoch will show about 30% in primary. Look at  2010 and how Coats beat Stutzman ... who has same base as Murdoch. From the Archives:  \"Democrats May Be Hard Pressed to Retain Evan Bayh Senate Seat\" (Political Junkie, Feb. 16, 2010). Dick Lugar has been virtually indestructible in Indiana since coming to the Senate in 1977.  But he was passed over as Reagan's running mate in 1980, and his bid for the White House went nowhere in 1996.\n                hide caption Talk of the Nation: Wednesday's Political  Junkie segment focused on the increasingly tense budget situation in the states, with special guest Rick Snyder, the new governor of Michigan.  Host Neal Conan and I also talked about Rahm Emanuel's victory in the Chicago mayoral race, Sen. Jeff Bingaman's (D-N.M.) decision to call it quits, Sen. John Thune's (R-S.D.) decision to stay out of the 2012 presidential race, the conservative challenge to Lugar, and the weird behavior of Rep. David Wu (D-Ore.).

            "article_content": "There aren't enough votes in the Senate to repeal the new health care law. That was pretty much a given even before a repeal attempt by the Senate GOP failed late Wednesday. Senate Republicans needed 60 votes to advance their repeal legislation and they clearly don't have that, the GOP minority having only 47 votes in its caucus. All 47 voted for the GOP amendment to repeal the health care law. Fifty one Democrats and independents voted against it. Sen. Mitch McConnell, however, the Senate minority leader, and his fellow Republicans don't have to win now to win later, as in 2012. It was McConnell who forced Wednesday's vote by introducing an amendment to a Federal Aviation Administration bill to repeal the health overhaul law. Republicans hope that by forcing some Senate Democrats facing tough re-election campaigns to vote against repeal, they would further weaken those Democrats' re-election chances and improve the odds the GOP will gain the four seats needed to take control of the Senate. The repeal vote would also let Senate Republicans energize their base by arguing that just a few more Republicans would get them over the top. As Josh Kraushaar outlined in a National Journal piece, attacking Democrats for their support of President Obama's health care agenda is an important part of the Republican plan to recapture the Senate majority. It's a path that goes through a number of states, including Nebraska, Montana and Virginia where, respectively, senators Ben Nelson, Jon Tester and Jim Webb face super competitive re-election contests. An excerpt: The GOP's most recent recruiting coup was convincing Rep. Denny Rehberg, R-Mont., to challenge Sen. Jon Tester, D-Mont. As the state's at-large representative, Rehberg is a popular figure and already has been on the statewide ballot. Since he was first elected in 2000, he's won at least 59 percent of the vote. Like many Democratic incumbents in Republican-leaning states, Tester will have to defend his votes on health care and spending. He'll also have to do some fence-mending with progressives, who helped propel him to the nomination in 2006. His vote against the Dream Act led Daily Kos publisher Markos Moulitsas to declare that Tester \"is the Blanche Lincoln of 2012\u2014the Democrat I will most be happy to see go down in defeat...\" ... Tester is far from the only Democrat who begins the year in a tough situation. Sen. Ben Nelson, D-Neb., represents an even more conservative state but has thrived due to the independent image he's carefully cultivated with his support for tax cuts, the Iraq war, and other GOP initiatives. But that changed over the last year after he spent much of 2010 defending his pivotal vote in the push to pass health care reform and took heat for trying to secure funding for his state in exchange for his vote\u2014derisively labeled the \"Cornhusker Kickback.\" Republican Attorney General Jon Bruning wasted no time entering the race, at the beginning of January. Both Democratic and Republican polling have shown Nelson trailing the GOP candidate. Meanwhile, Democrats are counting on the GOP efforts backfiring. They plan to continually tout popular provisions in the law, its ending of insurance companies' redlining of people with pre-existing conditions, for instance. As Alex Bolton reported for The Hill: Voting for McConnell's amendment could also open Republican candidates, such as Sens. Scott Brown (Mass.) and Olympia Snowe (Maine), to political scrutiny. \"They are going to have a hard time explaining why they voted to repeal the most popular consumer protections in the law,\" said a Senate Democratic aide.",

Luis Gutierrez, D-Ill., third from right, wait to be arrested while performing an act of civil disobedience at a rally for supporting the DREAM Act and immigration reform outside the White House in Washington, on Tuesday, July 26, 2011.  MICHEL MARTIN, host: Now to what many consider a crisis happening closer to home. Congressman Luis Gutierrez, along with labor and immigration activists was arrested in front of the White House last week to call attention to the hundreds of thousands of people who've been deported since President Obama's election. More people have been deported under this administration than any other. Representative Gutierrez, who is serving his 10th term representing the 4th congressional district in the president's home state of Illinois, is outspoken on a number of issues, but most recently he's been pushing his colleagues to pass the so-called Dream Act that would open a path to citizenship for some young people who were brought to the U.S. illegally as children. And Congressman Luis Gutierrez joins us now from member station WBEZ in Chicago. Congressman, welcome back. Thank you for joining us once again. Representative LUIS GUTIERREZ: Pleasure to be with you today. MARTIN: So, why did you decide to get arrested? Why did you feel a need to take that step? GUTIERREZ: One million people deported. Many, many, many of whom never been involved with our criminal justice system. Four million American citizen children who have one or both parents that are undocumented, being left behind each and every day because we have Specialist Nunez here in Chicago, whose wife was deported back to Mexico while he received orders to serve our country in Afghanistan. Because our immigration system is broken and the president, quite frankly, knows better and should have not only a better understanding, but a more compassionate treatment. I understand gang bangers and drug dealers and rapists and murderers and people who are bad, who come to the United States of America. I'm happy to put more resources so that we can rid ourselves of them. But that's not the Windex-wielding, cleaning lady at two in the morning that they're deporting. MARTIN: Sure. Well, let me just talk to you about this for a minute, if you would. 'Cause you and the president had an exchange of letters over this. And the president sent you a letter last week, which in response to your arrest and your other advocacy around this point. And he says, and his administration says that what they have done is shift the priority to those who are either - three categories: people who have committed serious offenses; you say you agree with that. People who are repeat offenders, which is to say people who have repeatedly violated the immigration laws. And also people who have recently arrived. And thus his argument would be that he's not, in fact, disrupting families and so forth. What accounts for this difference of perspective on this? GUTIERREZ: Well, number one, if today I decided I was going to change my behavior and I said, oh, by the way, for the last week here's how I've done it, I could say I've changed statistically how things are being done. So there's no doubt in my mind that they're attempting. But even as of yet, the fact is that most people deported from the United States of America, although they claim it, it's just not true. I sat with the president in May at the White House and he said to me, well, Luis, I guess you're talking about people - you're saying we should go after - I get that that we should go after the really, truly bad people. We are going to improve that system. So he didn't say to me, oh, Luis, you're wrong. He said, we're going to improve this. And so it's a recognition throughout the Obama administration. OK. So, Illinois, Governor Quinn says no to Secure Communities, the very program which is creating so many - so when you get arrested by a police officer, your name - your fingerprints go over to the Department of Homeland Security and they go, oh, you're undocumented, boom. You go through a deportation system. But you know that I'm a woman, I'm calling because I'm being abused by my husband. And my husband simply tells the police officer, oh, guess what, you have an immigration issue here, a much greater - and that's what - and the woman gets deported. And yet she didn't commit a crime. She just was revealed to authorities. MARTIN: I understand what you're saying, Mr. Gutierrez. But, you know, two points - and we only have about three minutes left. I'm sorry. I appreciate your trying to work with me here. GUTIERREZ: Yes. MARTIN: On the one hand there are those who would say that immigration violation is a crime. So therefore people should be deported. On the other hand, the president is also saying that the Department of Homeland Security does have the authority to make case by case decisions to grant relief to individuals in the circumstances that you just described where a person is being abused, but that it's not appropriate to use this authority in a categorical way to protect, you know, students or any other group of people. So what do you say to that? GUTIERREZ: Well, since we have such little time, three things. Number one, 22 U.S. senators, including Leahy, the chairman of the Judiciary Committee, and Durbin, the senator from the state of Illinois, a very close friend of Barack Obama, sent him an open letter 10 weeks ago saying, use your discretionary authority and stop the deportation of young people who came here at a tender three, four, five, six - the dream kids. Just stop them. Defer them and set them aside. So I'm not alone in this. That's about justice and fairness. MARTIN: Do you think he can use that authority categorically to protect a certain class of people? Do you think he can? GUTIERREZ: We know he can to the point that Lamar Smith has the Halt Act, which would take away that discretionary power away from him 'cause he fears he might use it. Number one. Number two. When I met with the president last December, he said, Luis, we will not have any progress on immigration reform until after I'm reelected President of the United States. Now, that's what he told me in December, yet that letter that you have and that you're sharing with the public that he sent back to me - it ends - that letter ends by saying, hey, Luis, why don't you go do your job and use that moral authority and energy you got to go get the Congress of the United States to act. Well, he told me that was futile. He told me that last December. He knows that that's a road that isn't going to lead to success. So why would he suggest that I use an opportunity which he knows doesn't exist. And the last thing is, he was at National Council of La Raza last week Monday to give a speech. But I would just like to - 'cause I think it's important - why does Luis Gutierrez and others make this demand? Because in the summer of 2008, he said, and I'm going to quote him almost exactly, right? When ICE raids terrorize communities, tearing babies from their mother's arms and having children arrive home from school to find their parents missing, when all these things are happening, it's time for a change. He called the raids - and as you have suggested earlier, there are more deportations under his administration and more raids. So does the terrorism continue? MARTIN: Well, I don't know about the raids, Mr. Gutierrez. Forgive me, we can attest to the number of deportations. But we can't attest to the raids per say. So but I do take your point, I do take your point on that. Well, finally, what is your assessment of this as a person? And we only have about a minute left. But as you're a person who's working in the same environment that he is in, you're in the Congress, you passed this bruising fight over the budget and the debt ceiling. People had to make some tough votes there. What is your assessment of whether it's possible to actually make more progress right now? GUTIERREZ: I agree with the president when he said that last December to me. I agreed with him then. And I would just like to say for two years he said to our community, I will make this a top priority. I want to get this past the first year of my administration. And yet the first two years of his administration, when we had 60, then 58 U.S. senators and we had 50 plus in the House of Representatives, not one initiative was taken in order to bring about comprehensive immigration reform. So the opportunity was missed. It's not there. But he can use his power, the discretionary power of the president to bring out fairness and justice and equity in these cases. MARTIN: Congressman Luis Gutierrez represents the 4th congressional district of Illinois. He was kind enough to join us from member station WBEZ in Chicago. Congressman Gutierrez, I hope we'll speak again. Thank you so much for joining us. GUTIERREZ: Look forward to it. Copyright \u00a9 2011 NPR.  All rights reserved.

            "article_content": "As the 2010 Census says Ohio's Latino population has grown 63.4 percent in the last decade, the League of United Latin American Citizens is having its convention in Cincinnati this week. To learn about Latinos in the Midwest and the pressing issues addressed at the convention, guest host Tony Cox speaks with LULAC national executive director Brent Wilkes.  TONY COX, host: I'm Tony Cox, and this is TELL ME MORE, from NPR News. I'm sitting in for Michel Martin, who is away. New studies show that black and Latino youth have found their own way to the Internet through their cell phones. But is that enough to close the racial digital divide? That's coming up in a bit. But first, when you think of a growing Latino population, you probably don't think of the Midwest or Ohio. But in the last 10 years, the Latino population in Ohio has grown by 63.4 percent, according to the 2010 census. It's one of the reasons why LULAC, the League of United Latin-American Citizens, decided to host their annual convention in Cincinnati this week. LULAC is the oldest Hispanic civil rights organization in the country. And to find out where the group stands on some of today's important issues facing Latinos, we invited Brent Wilkes, national executive director of LULAC. He joins us now from Cincinnati. Brent, nice to have you. BRENT WILKES: It's great to be on the show, Tony. COX: We think of Cincinnati - let's begin with this - as home of the oldest team in professional baseball, the Cincinnati Reds, of course, and its festive river boats, not necessarily a growing Latino population. What drew LULAC to have its convention there, considering other cities with Latinos in much larger numbers? WILKES: Well, what really drew us was the phenomenal growth of the Latino population not only in Ohio, but in Kentucky, just south of the river here, an explosive growth. And by coming to Cincinnati really early on in the process -and we're hoping to have an impact and get folks off to the right start, so that the future of the state - we've seen figures that show that the 75 percent of the growth in Ohio is due to the Latino population in the last 10 years. And that's going to continue. So we're trying to pave the way for the future and help the state prepare for its growing Hispanic population. COX: What are the key issues to be addressed at the convention? I know that you have Secretary Solis and Secretary Sebelius, who were participating this week. Is immigration reform at the top of the list? WILKES: Well, it is and it isn't. It is in the sense that immigration reform is extremely important to our community. It's something that we've been working very hard to try to pass, especially things like the Dream Act. But we also recognize that it's a difficult political climate. So, really, the focus of this convention is to prepare for the 2012 elections and to be a force to be reckoned with in those elections, because we really believe that in order to move this issue forward, we're going to have to show up at the ballot box and make our opinions heard. And so that's really a big push at this convention. We're registering thousands of voters across the country. We hope to make sure that the Hispanic population is not only growing, but voting, as well, and we think that that'll help position ourselves in the coming years for a chance at getting comprehensive immigration reform passed. COX: If you're joining us, I'm Tony Cox sitting in for Michel Martin, and you're listening to TELL ME MORE, from NPR News. And we are here with Brent Wilkes, national executive director of LULAC, talking about their convention currently taking place in Cincinnati, Ohio. I want to follow up on a point about the election next year. President Obama, Brent, has come under criticism for his - what some would call a not-so-aggressive stance in support of immigration reform. It's also suggested that his position could cost him Latino votes in 2012. What is LULAC's position with regard to supporting the president, given his record on immigration reform? WILKES: You know, there is a sense of disappointment. Certainly, you can understand that. There was a lot of hope when the president came in promising change. We thought that we had the position in Congress to be able to get this done this session. But what ended up happening, I think, is that the president did focus on other issues at the beginning of his term first, hoping to get to immigration reform a little bit later. But by the time he got there, his honeymoon had subsided and his political capital was not strong enough to, you know, allow him to get immigration reform through Congress this past year. COX: Does that mean, then, that LULAC is going to move from the Democratic column to the Republican column? And I ask that because, just this week, as you are aware, Michele Bachmann announced her candidacy, joining a number of others in the GOP fold who say that it's time - I'm not saying that she's saying this, but other candidates are saying it's time for the Republican Party to more aggressively court Latinos. So are you up for grabs in 2012 - the Latinos in your organization? WILKES: You know, we're non-partisan at LULAC, first of all. So we're not really picking sides in the campaign. But I do have to say that we do want to educate our community about who's supported our issues and who hasn't. Now, is it good to have Republicans courting the Latino vote? Absolutely. Especially considering the alternative, which is using the Latino vote as a wedge issue and trying to, you know, pick up white votes based on picking on the Latino community. And we've seen that happen, too, especially from some of the more conservative elements. So they got their work cut out for them, because their positions had been pretty tough on immigration reform. I think they've been the ones really stirring up the resentment in the country. And that's unfortunate, because when you pit people against each other for, you know, electoral gain, you might gain politically personally, but you really harm the country. COX: One of the issues that we don't normally hear much about from the Latino community, at least not publicly, has to do with gay marriage and gay rights. Now, given last week's landmark vote in New York legalizing gay marriage, how does your organization view these changes? Are you in support of gay marriage? WILKES: We absolutely are in support of gay marriage. We understand that this is a civil rights issue, just like all the other civil rights issues that we've dealt with. And there's so many people within our community that are affected by this issue, we want to make sure that they have all the rights and privileges of every other American. COX: One of the other issues that I'd like to bring up with you in the time that we have left has to do with the border and the violence that has taken place between Mexico and the United States along the border involving the drug cartels. What position has your organization taken with regard to how the United States should handle its policy toward fighting drug cartels in Mexico? WILKES: Well, we really are concerned. I mean, I think that our focus has been on the Middle East, unfortunately, in the last decade, and we're not really looking at a very troubling situation in Mexico. We don't want to have an Afghanistan next door. And we've got to step in and we've got to support the government there to combat a very virulent threat. But we can't do it just by enforcement alone. We could help, for example, by honoring Mexico's request and trying to cut down on the flow of guns south of the border from the United States. We can also work on development. We've never provided the type of aid to help develop the economy of Mexico. And what ends up happening when you have a bad economy is not only are you having lots of immigrants, of course, wanting to come here, but you also have the seeds for the cartels to operate in. And I think we've got to be a stronger partner with Mexico. Our history and our future is linked to them much more than many Americans realize. COX: Last thing: We began the conversation talking about immigration reform and noting the fact, correctly, that your organization is meeting in Cincinnati as part of the sign that Latinos in America are moving around, and sometimes they're moving to the Midwest. And we also have had stories about Latinos moving into the South. And you know about the states, Alabama, certainly Arizona and others who have come up with what some consider draconian anti-immigration reform measures. How concerned are you about that trend in America? And to what extent is that having an impact on where Latinos decide to live? WILKES: Well, we're very concerned. These laws are extremely troubling, especially considering the fact that the people promulgating them are the same ones that are blocking us from getting immigration reform passed at the federal level, where the responsibility for immigration really lies. And so these laws are not really designed to target immigrants or undocumented immigrants, they're actually designed to harass Latinos within their state, because they say things, like, anybody that looks like they might be an immigrant, you can stop them and ask for their papers or you can discriminate against them safely because, you know, they might be an immigrant. Well, who are they talking about when they say they might look like an immigrant? They're not talking about non-Latino whites. They're talking about primarily the Latino community and other communities. So what's happening is they are driving their Latino populations to other states. Nobody seems to notice that, you know, Georgia had 40 percent of their crops not picked. And those things hurt their economy. And it's as if they're cutting their nose off to spite their face, and they don't seem to realize it. COX: Brent Wilkes is the national executive director of LULAC, the League of United Latin-American Citizens, the oldest Hispanic civil rights organization in the country. He joined us from member station WGUC in Cincinnati, where the group is having its annual convention. Brent, thank you very much for joining us. WILKES: It's great to be on. Thank you.

Yesterday, Obama spoke to the U.S.' largest Latino civil rights group. To learn about Latinos' priorities and political strategies of getting them addressed, host Michel Martin speaks with the National Council of La Raza's Janet Murguia.

MICHEL MARTIN, host: I'm Michel Martin and this is TELL ME MORE from NPR News. Coming up, when we learned of the gunman who killed dozens of people in Norway last week saying he was waging a war against Islam, most people probably thought one of two things: the work of a terrorist or the work of a madman. But what is the line between the two? Is extreme bigotry itself a mental illness? We'll explore that question in just a few minutes. But, first, we just spoke with two of the nation's leading civil rights leaders. Now we have a third: the leader of a group that President Obama chose to address even in the middle of his work on the debt issue. The group is the National Council of La Raza. It's holding its annual conference here in Washington, D.C. The group is the largest Latino civil rights organization in the country. And the president talked about his efforts to reach out to the community, including a recent meeting of Latino leaders at the White House. President BARACK OBAMA: We weren't just paying lip service to the community. Our work together, not just that day, but every day, has been more than just talk. MARTIN: Some Latinos, though, are beginning to question whether that is, in fact, true. We wanted to talk more about that, so we've called upon Janet Murguia. She is the president of the National Council of La Raza. And she was kind enough to take a break from the conference to speak with us now. Thank you so much for joining us. JANET MURGUIA: Thank you. It's a pleasure to be with you. MARTIN: I wanted to ask, though, about the big meta issue in Washington right now, which is these ongoing negotiations over the debt and the deficit. Do you feel that this issue is crowding out other issues that are also of concern to you? Are you concerned? Do you think there will be a deal? MURGUIA: Well, I guess we don't know for sure. But I do know that this is an issue that affects all of us, including the Latino community. In fact, the stakes are quite high for the Latino community because of our demographics. The large level of growth that we've seen since the last census demonstrates a couple of key things. Latino children are going to be the cohort of individuals on which Social Security will rely on in the next 10 to 20 years. And at the back end it is Latino seniors who rely disproportionately on those Social Security checks as their single source of income. So we've got a lot at stake in these discussions and they do appear to be very much in flux. MARTIN: What are the priorities of the people at the conference meeting here? Many people associate your group with fighting for immigrants rights or around the issue of comprehensive immigration reform. And I wonder if that's still at the top of the agenda, given all the other things going on, including, you know, the ongoing economic troubles, which are, as the president and as you just said, affecting Latinos disproportionately hard. MURGUIA: What we have found is that typically the economy and jobs, education have been at the very top of the list when it comes to issues of concern to the Hispanic community. But interestingly enough, we have done a straw poll at our conference and we've seen that polls done with the Latino community since the Arizona law that was passed, SB1070, since that time, Latinos have ranked immigration as one of the top issues. And so there is a shift in the Latino community. Immigration has risen to the top of the list of priorities for the Latino community. MARTIN: Well, to that end, though, during his campaign - his campaign for the presidency, then Senator Obama told your group that he was not going to be just another guy who talks the talk, but who's going to be somebody who walks the walk and actually does something about immigration reform. How do your members evaluate his promise along those lines? MURGUIA: I think the Latino community and in particular Latino voters are pretty thoughtful about this. And I think they understand that when it comes to comprehensive immigration reform, the president does, as he stated at our conference, need a dance partner. And that the Republicans really have to step up in a way where he can engage and it can be a bipartisan solution. We understand that. But there is the issue around the level of deportations that are occurring today during the Obama administration that are at the highest levels that we've seen in the country's history - even higher than when President Bush was in office. And that is very, very alarming to the Latino community only because we do not disagree that violent criminals and gang members should be deported. But what's happening right now is that the priorities of how people are being deported, we're seeing, unfortunately, regrettably, many students who would qualify for the Dream Act. Students who have been here for their whole lives, but were brought to this country by their parents when they were very, very young and who are now in situations where they are facing deportations. We're seeing a lot of families being separated because, in fact, some of the folks that are being targeted are farm workers or dishwashers or maids. And we think that there ought to be a prioritization that occurs with enforcement so that we're targeting those who are higher risk felons or higher risk criminals. MARTIN: Well, what does the administration say when you make this case to them? I mean, what do you make of the administration's response? MURGUIA: Well, I believe that there's an honest disagreement, but, you know, from the perspective of our community, we've been looking at the data to date. And it does reflect that there have been families that are separated and those who have been in the least risk in terms of the nature of infractions who have been - still being deported. And so, you know, again, we have no issue with violent criminals and gang members who we all agree should be removed. But we are talking about the millions of farm workers, hotel maids, cooks and landscapers who work hard every day to provide for their families. And I do believe that there is a disagreement between many of the folks who we know have reviewed the president's level of authority in this area and what the Department of Homeland Security, I believe, is advising the president. But we believe that he has some authority to provide relief in this area to the separation that's occurring among these families. And we believe he ought to use it. MARTIN: And we've talked about the president, what about the Republican presidential candidates of which there are a number of declared candidates at this point. Are any of them addressing the conference as well? MURGUIA: Well, that's been something that's been very disappointing for us because, in fact, we invited at least five of the candidates running for president in the Republican Party, and were turned down and that's disappointing because clearly they have chosen other priorities, you know, with just 16 months before the election. I think it's fair to remind them that key analysts in their own party has said that no Republican can win the presidency without at least 40 percent of the Latino vote. And, frankly, when you look right now at what the leading individuals in the Republican Party are doing, it is alarming to the Hispanic community right now. At the federal level we've seen many in the Republican senators and House members who have been at the lead of blocking comprehensive immigration reform. And at the state level, it's been worse. It has been Republicans who have been leading the effort to pass legislation that attacks immigrants and Latinos. So, the Republicans do not seem to be positioning themselves to be even in the conversation. And I do give a lot of credit to President Obama for at least being in the conversation. Look, our organization, the Latino community, has not agreed with him on every issue. And we are taking him to task on the level of deportations, but he came. And the same cannot be said about the Republicans and the Republican Party right now. MARTIN: Janet Murguia is the president and CEO of the National Council of La Raza. It's the largest Latino civil rights organization in the country. She was nice enough to take a break from the conference that the National Council is holding in Washington, D.C. to speak to us on the line. Janet Murguia, thank you so much for joining us.

            "article_content": "As protests continue across Egypt, the city of Alexandria is tense. Pro-Mubarak forces seem to be dominant in the streets, despite scattered demonstrations organized by the banned Muslim Brotherhood.  LIANE HANSEN, host: After nearly two weeks of street protests, residents of Egypt's second largest city, Alexandria, are trying to return to their everyday lives. NPR's Soraya Sarhaddi Nelson visited Alexandria and found that many people in the Mediterranean city are tired of the chaos. And even some who support the protests feel it's time to get their economy back to normal. (Soundbite of traffic and vendors) SORAYA SARHADDI NELSON: Business is good for vendors selling oranges, bananas and cauliflower at a makeshift market they've set up at this Alexandria intersection. Fresh produce is a welcome sight to many Alexandrians who struggled in the past week with bread shortages, and a tripling of prices on staples like meat and milk. (Soundbite of gas pump) NELSON: A few gas stations have reopened, although their offerings are limited. This station is out of everything but premium gas. Even some banks are opening their doors again. And volunteers are out on the streets, bagging garbage that's been accumulating for 10 days now. (Soundbite of machinery) NELSON: Locksmith Michael Roushdy William grinds a key for a customer who comes in. This is the second day he's reopened his shop and business is picking up. But William is deeply unhappy about what is happening in Egypt. He says the never-ending television footage of protestors packing Tahrir Square in Cairo is enough to make his blood boil. Mr. MICHAEL ROUSHDY WILLIAM (Locksmith): Do you think what is inside Tahrir represents the 85 million? I don't think so. NELSON: Yet every Egyptian is suffering the consequences. A report issued by Credit Agricole Bank estimates the political crisis is costing Egypt $310 million every day. William's friend Raymond Fraig, who runs a construction firm, is one of the few Alexandrians who kept his business open. Mr. RAYMOND FRAIG (Construction): The people working with me, I told them if anyone didn't came to work, he considers to be - pppft- hired and fired. You want to work, okay. You want to protest, go to the protestors and go to hell. NELSON: But William closed his shop for a week because of the protests and subsequent vandalism and looting in Alexandria. Mr. WILLIAM: My friend made a group over the Net, telling that we shall go work and leave what's inside Tahrir to leave inside Tahrir, and life will go on. NELSON: How life will go on for Alexandrians in the coming weeks is another matter. Tourism isn't likely to rebound anytime soon in this city, which heavily depends on it. A growing xenophobia in Alexandria, spurred by Egyptian officials who blame international media for the political crisis, make it unsafe for foreigners to be out on the streets. In addition, the police here have yet to return to their posts, leaving it up to residents armed with sticks, bars, knives, and sometimes guns to protect their homes and businesses. Reached by phone after curfew, Dr. Magid Etman was one of those who patrolled with his neighbors. Dr. MAGID ETMAN: That's why most people don't go to work. They spend the night in the streets trying to, like, protect themselves and protect their families. This never happened before. You know, you used to sleep at night, you know, nothing would ever happen. NELSON: Karim El-Sawaf, who patrols with neighbors in another part of the city, agrees. The unemployed electrical engineer, like others interviewed for this story, wants the protestors to go home. Mr. KARIM EL-SAWAF (Electrical Engineer): It's useless, I'm sorry. They are not get anything now. People are not listening to them now. When was the last time Mubarak speak? He did not say anything more. And he will not say anything more. (Soundbite of chanting protestors) NELSON: But the banned Muslim Brotherhood, which is strong in Alexandria and continues to organize large protests here, like this one on Friday, appears unwilling to give up. Mr. SOBHI SALEH (Former Secretary General, Muslim Brotherhood's Parliamentary Group): (Foreign language spoken) NELSON: Sobhi Saleh, a former independent lawmaker aligned to the Brotherhood, says the group's supporters will march or go on strike for as long as it takes until Mubarak steps down and free and fair elections are guaranteed.

Host Michel Martin hears from author Jimi Izrael, civil rights attorney Arsalan Iftikhar, sports editor David Zirin and syndicated columnist Ruben Navarrette.

Now it's time for our weekly visit to the Barbershop where the guys talk about what's in the news and what's on their minds. Sitting in the chairs for a shapeup this week are author Jimi Izrael, civil rights attorney and editor Arsalan Iftikhar, syndicated columnist Ruben Navarrette and sports editor at the magazine The Nation, Dave Zirin. Take it away, Jimi. JIMI IZRAEL: Thanks, Michel. Hey, fellas. What's good? Welcome to the shop. ARSALAN IFTIKHAR: Hey, hey, hey. RUBEN NAVARRETTE: Doing good, man. DAVE ZIRIN: Hey. IZRAEL: Hey, man, so check this out. It's like Obama is kind of - he's trying to double down all this good will he's getting because he's doing a U.S. troop withdrawal down in Afghanistan. President Obama took to the airwaves on Wednesday to say he's pulling 10,000 troops out by the end of the year and another 23,000 troops by the end of next summer. Wow. What do you guys think of that? MARTIN: Arsalan, why don't you go first? IFTIKHAR: Well, you know, for anybody who has been following the war in Afghanistan, especially, you know, recent developments, we all remember his December 2009 speech at West Point where he essentially doubled down on the troop levels that were currently there to increase it by 33,000. And essentially now what he's doing a year and a half later is saying, well, I'm taking that double down back now by next year. What's important, I think for us as Americans is there are certain figures out that say that it costs about $1.2 million per soldier to keep a soldier in Afghanistan for one year. So a 10,000-troop drawdown would be $12 billion in savings that could obviously go - better spent here on items. And, you know, it's nothing to sneeze at. And so, you know, sadly, he can't catch a political break either on the left or the right. I think that people are just going to, you know, take out their haterade bottles and, you know, try to undermine him in whatever he does. IZRAEL: Well, yeah, count me there, man. I'm sorry. You know, I'm something of a cynic. This may be of - some shock to you, but I'm something of a cynic. You know, I'm certainly glad to see the men and women come home. I'm down with that, but I wonder if it's too early and I hope the job is done, you know, or really close to done. And another thing I'm wondering about is, I mean, so the people that are playing cleanup, will they be safe? You know, I'm concerned about that. I don't know. And I'm hoping - the timing is kind of hinky. We've got the elections coming up - is that a coincidence? I don't know. Ruben, what do you think? (SOUNDBITE OF LAUGHTER) NAVARRETTE: I think it's a lot more complicated than my friend, Arsalan, would like us to believe in terms of haterade. I think it's really interesting and a very complicated issue because he's right that you have people on the left - Democrats in Congress - who are really upset with Obama. Most of the criticism he's gotten for this plan has come from the left, from Democrats who say 5,000 troops out this year isn't enough. They wanted 15. 35,000 overall isn't enough in the next two years. They wanted 65,000 out. A lot of the criticism he's getting and has gotten over the last two and a half years have been from Democrats in Congress, Howard Dean, the anti-war faction of the Democratic Party that used to love, love going after Bush because they hated Bush and they hated war, so it all worked together nicely. Now they're with Obama, they love Obama, but they hate war and their heads are about to explode. So it got very, very interesting that way. But I got to say, I got to say, the Republicans are likewise blowing it because they're in a really tough spot, right? We're in a place where our politics is. If I'm running against Jimi, anything he says I'll just say the opposite. So basically the Republicans have been pulled into this dovish position. The elephant has gone dovish. The elephant's a dove. All of a sudden all of the Republicans are talking about being isolationists and pulling back and getting out of Afghanistan. And I got to say, if you believe, like a lot of Americans, that it's too expensive to be in Afghanistan and we ought to come home, but at the same time we still live in a dangerous world, do you really think I'm going to get - Mitt Romney is going to protect me? Is Tim Pawlenty going to protect me? Is Rick Santorum going to protect me? No, no, no. Get ready, because we're about to see a fascinating election where the guy who's a tough guy is Obama who stands up and says, listen, my name is Barack Obama and I did Osama, OK? I protected you all. I took care of this business. And these guys over here on the far right, they want to pull out of the world. So it's going to get freaky. It's really, really interesting stuff. ZIRIN: Yeah. MARTIN: Just to - you know, Ron Christie was on - Dave, we want to hear from you, obviously, but you're not a Republican. So - at least we don't think so. (SOUNDBITE OF LAUGHTER) MARTIN: But on the program earlier... ZIRIN: Safe bet, Michel. NAVARRETTE: Hey, I want to say I'm not a Republican either. I just play one on the radio. MARTIN: You just play one on the radio. Yeah, we know. NAVARRETTE: OK. MARTIN: Better you than me. (SOUNDBITE OF LAUGHTER) MARTIN: But saying that, but Ron Christie earlier, though, giving the other position kind of the - who obviously worked for President George W. Bush and Vice President Dick Cheney, giving the other side of that argument. You know, his argument was that this is not the time to pull out. The situation isn't resolved yet. So I guess why, Ruben, I'm just reinforcing your point that... NAVARRETTE: Right. MARTIN: ...there are fractures on both sides of the aisle on this. Yeah. NAVARRETTE: Oh, absolutely. MARTIN: So Dave, go ahead. ZIRIN: There are fractures on both sides, and I would argue it's overwhelmingly governed by political opportunism. I mean you can go back to the Kosovo war and find speeches by Tom DeLay where he sounds like a peacenik just because Bill Clinton was pushing it. I think we have to push aside the political opportunism and ask ourselves the question: does a continued and prolonged U.S. occupation of Afghanistan, the graveyard of empires from Alexander the Great to the USSR, actually make you and me, Joe and Jane Six Pack, safer here in the United States, and does it actually make life better for people on the ground in Afghanistan? I actually - I stand with NBC reporter Richard Engel who's been on the ground and has been making the talk-show circuit, saying we got to not only pull out of there now but end this war on terror nonsense, because what it is is propaganda taking the place of politics. MARTIN: Can I just - one more point there. One of the things that I think contributes  to the restiveness in this country is the sense that historical parallels are always dangerous, but the sense that Americans have that the Afghans aren't really pulling their weight in this and there are, in fact, somewhat hostile... NAVARRETTE: Right. MARTIN: ...to the United States.  I just want to play... NAVARRETTE: Right. MARTIN: ...that the leadership I mean by that, a couple of weeks ago, asking Afghan President Hamid Karzai warned NATO that quote, \"if it turns to the behavior of an occupation, of course, the Afghan people know how to deal with that.\" Sort of implying that, you know, we're taking the U.S. on. And then in response to that here's a clip from parting U.S. ambassador to Afghanistan, Karl Eikenberry last week. KARL EIKENBERRY: When Americans, who are serving in your country at great cost in terms of lives and treasures, when they hear themselves compared with occupiers, told that they are only here to advance their own narrow interest, and likened to the brutal enemies of the Afghan people, my people in turn, they're filled with confusion and they grow weary of our effort here. MARTIN: Arsalan, final thought here? IFTIKHAR: Well, you know, everybody who knows anything about Afghanistan knows that Hamid Karzai is sort of known as the mayor of Kabul. Basically his power extends to the city limits and that's about it. I mean Afghanistan is, you know, like Dave said, the graveyard of empires and essentially you have fiefdoms. You know, you have the south and Helmand province. You have north. You know, to go in there for over a decade and, you know, purport to, you know, create a Jeffersonian democracy is slightly Pollyanna-ish. And so I do agree that, you know, Hamid Karzai has not been an honest broker or an honest partner. But again, I don't think that a prolonged occupation in Afghanistan is going to get them any closer to a Jeffersonian democracy. MARTIN: Just to clarify for folks who may have missed it, the troops that are expected to be pulled out by the end of next summer, that's 33,000. IFTIKHAR: Right. MARTIN: That's 33,000. Just want to clarify that. If you're just joining us, you're listening to our weekly Barbershop segment with author Jimi Izrael, civil rights attorney Arsalan Iftikhar, syndicated columnist Ruben Navarrette, and sports writer Davie Zirin. Now here's a little something to set us up for our next topic. (SOUNDBITE OF SONG, \"PANTS ON THE GROUND\") GENERAL LARRY PLATT: (Singing) Pants on the ground. Pants on the ground. Looking like a fool with your pants on the ground. Gold in your mouth. Hat turned sideways, pants hit the ground. Call yourself a cool cat. Pants on the ground. Pants on the ground. Looking like a fool... (SOUNDBITE OF LAUGHTER) MARTIN: Who could forget General Larry Platt, who sang, if you can call it that, this song for the \"American Idol\" audition in 2010. It became a cultural hit. Just thought I'd share that. Jimi, back to you. (SOUNDBITE OF LAUGHTER) IZRAEL: Thank you. Just as I was able to get back to sleep from having heard that song one time too many. (SOUNDBITE OF LAUGHTER) IZRAEL: Yet it comes back. MARTIN: Oh, you love it. IZRAEL: Thank you. Well, I guess it's kind of apropos, because last week, a young college student named Deshon Marman was kicked off a US Airways flight for refusing to pull up his sagging pants. Now the pants were reportedly hanging mid-thigh revealing his underwear. Now, this week photos surface of a man dressed in drag, wearing either... NAVARRETTE: Not much. IZRAEL: ...a bikini or a bikini or a bra and panties or some such at the airport. Now despite passenger complaints, he was able to fly, and but the kid wasn't. (SOUNDBITE OF LAUGHTER) IZRAEL: The college kid wasn't. What's up with that? MARTIN: But, Jimi... NAVARRETTE: That's underwear profiling, baby. I'm not into that. MARTIN: Underwear profiling. IZRAEL: Right. (SOUNDBITE OF LAUGHTER) MARTIN: But you're leaving out one relevant detail I think... NAVARRETTE: That's not all right. MARTIN: ...which is that Deshon Marman, the University of New Mexico football player who was arrested, says that he couldn't - his hands were full and he couldn't pull up his pants because his hands were full and that he became - and then they arrested him rather than giving him an opportunity to comply. And he is African-American, and the gentleman who was flying with his thigh-high stockings and his underwear, and a little shrug, a little sweater, was white. So that's part of the... IZRAEL: Thank you for filling in the blanks, Michel. I appreciate that. Ruben, lucky you. NAVARRETTE: Yo, man. IZRAEL: Your first in, dog. (SOUNDBITE OF LAUGHTER) IZRAEL: You're first in. Go ahead. NAVARRETTE: Thank you. What did I do to you? IZRAEL: What do you think about this? The dress codes in the friendly skies, man. NAVARRETTE: Yeah. Yeah. I think that when most people I think have understood this at least since 9/11 if not before - that as a law professor once put it to me, you know, if you read the back of the ticket that you buy when you buy to fly, you know, you'd realize you'd be shocked at all the rights you've given away to the airlines. And the airlines have lots of different rights to discharge you off airplanes for lots of different reasons. And a lot of times they've done this, particularly after 9/11, in very unfair and egregious ways that have been unfair, amounted to profiling and other things. And so I think that you have to look at this in this context. I think it's very possibly, that - possible that these people overreacted on the ground. I don't know about, you know, my hands were full, I couldn't pull up my pants. I'm not sure that's all credible. How long, were your pants down to your ankles? Whatever. MARTIN: But who cares that his pants were sagging? IFTIKHAR: Yeah, you're under arrest. You're under arrest. MARTIN: What if he was wearing - I mean so what, if he was wearing a sarong or a skirt. NAVARRETTE: I don't know. I don't know. I... IZRAEL: Right. Yeah. Exactly. MARTIN: So what? NAVARRETTE: I don't, I don't know where that's coming from in terms of what they did on the ground. But I do know that airlines have a lot more power than most people realize in terms of policing the air, finding out who flies and who doesn't, and they sometimes abuse that power. This may be a case of that. This other case is weird though, the guy who just showed up in women's underwear like as a protest, you know, and they let him on. I mean that's disruptive in another way. But it's not, I think the two are not really comparable. The other one about the woman, the guy in the women's underwear is just the way to weird and way too off the wall to compare to anything. IFTIKHAR: Well, I think that, you know, this is Arsalan. IZRAEL: Go ahead, A-Train. IFTIKHAR: I do think that there is double standard at play here. And I think that they can, you know, and that a parallel can be made. And the parallel that I would make is, you know, let's imagine that the guy in the women's panties was an African-American male. And let's say, you know, there was a white dude who had his pants down, you know, at thigh-high level, you know, would an African-American male in women's panties be allowed to fly? I don't know. You know, the jury's... IZRAEL: No, man. No, that would be a scandal. IFTIKHAR: What? IZRAEL: I can't  that would be a scandal. I can't see that happening. NAVARRETTE: But wrapped up... IZRAEL: Will shutdown the whole airport. Serious? IFTIKHAR: And, you know, Ruben did make a good point in that, you know, after 9/11, you know, this is just a pattern of, you know, some egregious behavior by the airline. I mean we've had, you know, cases where people who had, you know, Arabic writing on their T-shirts were kicked off planes. NAVARRETTE: Right. IFTIKHAR: Or people wearing Muslim garb, you know, as our friend Juan Williams likes to say, who were kicked summarily. You know, again, I think that there is, you know, certain double standards at play here and, you know, I think that it's important for it to be called out when it happens. IZRAEL: Dave? ZIRIN: Well, I feel like I have to recuse myself from this discussion, because currently I am not wearing pants. (SOUNDBITE OF LAUGHTER) MARTIN: Oh no. Oh no. What are you wearing, a tasteful sarong? NAVARRETTE: I am so glad this is radio. I am so grateful this is radio. MARTIN: A tasteful sarong or what? IFTIKHAR: This is NPR. (SOUNDBITE OF LAUGHTER) ZIRIN: A tasteful sarong. Yeah. MARTIN: A tasteful sarong or something. NAVARRETTE: Thank God it's not television. (SOUNDBITE OF LAUGHTER) IZRAEL: There's nothing wrong with sarongs, brothers. I rock a sarong when it gets hot. as I mentioned in my... ZIRIN: I wear a muumuu. MARTIN: Well, before, okay... (SOUNDBITE OF LAUGHTER) MARTIN: Well, Dave, all right. So Dave, why don't you tell us a little bit of last night's NBA draft. ZIRIN: Good gracious, that NBA draft was something. Two of the stories that are - people are talking about today is in the top of the first round you had two Lithuanian guys, a Turkish guy, a Congolese guy, a Serbian guy, a Czech guy, a Latvian guy, a Croatian guy and a lot of broadcasters who are looking at each other like, yeah, I don't know anything about him. Let's go to the video that looks like it was taken in a hostage situation and see if this person can actually play or not. And it actually, I know on good authority that it got so uncomfortable with a lot of the announcers just not knowing any of the players, that one of the producers had to call into them and say hey, ease on the xenophobia a little bit, guys because it's getting a little too... MARTIN: That's interesting. ZIRIN: Who are these guys? Their names are funny to me and I can't pronounce them. But despite all that, there's some really great stories there. There are the Morris twins, Markieff and Marcus Morris, Markieff identical twins, born seven minutes before his brother then drafted seven minutes before his brother. Then the story of Jimmy Butler. IFTIKHAR: Right. ZIRIN: Homeless at 13, drafted by the Chicago Bulls, which is an amazing spot for him. That's the last pick in the first round, which is also great because that means there is guaranteed money. And Butler's insistence of saying I do not want your pity because pity is the one thing - he says that every time he does an interview - yeah, I was homeless, yeah, it's been tough, but pity is the one thing I do not want. He's an amazing kid. MARTIN: Arsalan, who do you like? Anything exciting? IFTIKHAR: Yeah, no, I mean the Jimmy Butler story obviously, you know, for someone from Chicago and, you know, going to Marquette, the kid's story is amazing. You know, obviously the Morris twins at 13 and 14 was great. What we, you know, there are a lot of whispers and pre-draft buzz, you know, about major, you know, blockbuster trades that could potentially happen. You know, Tony Parker might be leaving the San Antonio Spurs. Steve Nash, is he going to, you know, be dealt. I think with the impending lockout and, you know, the labor talks that are going on, I think that it's going to affect a lot of free agency and blockbuster trades are going to happen. MARTIN: Well, I didn't understand. I'm sorry. Forgive me for interrupting, but can I hear a little bit more about this potential lockout. So the NFL is locked out. Are you telling us, Dave, that the NBA may lockout too? ZIRIN: As of July 1st, yes. And there are huge gaps between the Players Association and David Stern, the NBA commissioner. They've been doing long meetings - like nine, 10-hour day meetings in New York this whole past week. There's a last meeting today, and if a deal isn't pounded out today then you will most likely see a lockout July 1st, and that would mean no summer league, which will be terrible for the players. And these are some big name players too who didn't even get drafted last night  big name players - Ben Hansbrough, Scotty Hopson who aren't going to have the summer leagues to be able to prove themselves going forward. MARTIN: And Ruben, I have a curveball for you. We only have about a minute-and-a-half left. NAVARRETTE: Yeah. Yeah. MARTIN: You know that our dear friend, Jimi Izrael, has some big news this weekend. (SOUNDBITE OF LAUGHTER) NAVARRETTE: Tell me. MARTIN: He's about to tie the knot. NAVARRETTE: Oh. IFTIKHAR: Oh, mazel tov. MARTIN: And I thought in a minute that we have left... NAVARRETTE: Yeah. MARTIN: ...we wanted to wish him our very best. But I thought you, as our senior married man here... NAVARRETTE: Oh, yeah. MARTIN: ...as part of the crew, the Barbershop crew, that I thought... NAVARRETTE: Sure. It's 10 years now.  Yeah. MARTIN: ...you would want to speak on behalf of your brethren... NAVARRETTE: Yes. MARTIN: ...to offer him what? Best wishes? What? IFTIKHAR: Godspeed. (SOUNDBITE OF LAUGHTER) NAVARRETTE: God bless you. No. I think it's great and I think that you are, you know, marrying a wonderful woman, as we all know. And I think that this is great and this is a start of another important chapter. But just always keep your priorities. You learn from other mistakes, mistakes I've made, others have made, in terms of work takes over sometimes, but it's about family first. And stay focused on that because that's the enduring thing, man. Jobs come and go and opportunities come and go, money comes and goes and all. But at the end of it it's about family and about, you know, keeping it together and spending that quality time with folks. So make it happen, baby. ZIRIN: And enjoy yourself because... MARTIN: Dave, go ahead. ZIRIN: Enjoy yourself. Just enjoy yourself because the first marriage is always the best. MARTIN: Oh, man. IFTIKHAR: Ouch. Ouch. MARTIN: Yeah, man. Arsalan, very quickly. IFTIKHAR: The last... NAVARRETTE: Is it the third or my fourth? IFTIKHAR: Listen, the last word in marriage, you can be right or you can be happy, but you can't be both. So mazel tov and Godspeed, Jimi. IZRAEL: Thank you. Thank you, everybody. MARTIN: And Jimi, you know, my advice is yes dear. Remember these words: Yes dear. (SOUNDBITE OF LAUGHTER) NAVARRETTE: That's right. You're right. I'm wrong.

            "article_content": "Frank Henkel addresses a press conference in Berlin on September 19th. The Interior Minister has called for a ban on the populist NPD party. \n                \n                    \n                    Michael Kappeler/Getty Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption Frank Henkel addresses a press conference in Berlin on September 19th. The Interior Minister has called for a ban on the populist NPD party. Berlin's newly appointed  Interior Minister called for a ban on the right-wing populist NPD party at a meeting  of Germany's interior  ministers in Wiesbaden. Minister Frank  Henkel (CDU) said a clear signal must be sent to what he called right-wing extremists. \"I  believe the interior ministers will intensify the fight against right-wing  extremists and agree on a common strategy moving forward,\" Henkel said on the first day of the three-day  conference, which started Wednesday. Calls for an end to  the NPD (Nationaldemokratische Partei Deutschlands) have been growing since the  arrest of ex-party functionary, Ralf Wohlleben, in connection with a series of  racially motivated murders. Wohlleben is suspected of having aided Beate  Zsch\u00e4pe, Uwe B\u00f6hnhardt and Uwe Mundlos, who made up the far-right  Zwickau cell  accused of committing at least ten murders, mostly of immigrants,  between 2000 and 2007. Berlin's newly formed  CDU/SPD cross-party government also announced a legally binding ban on the NPD   as one of its main aims during the presentation of its coalition agreement last  week. If the courts approve the measure, the NPD's headquarters in the  Berlin  district of K\u00f6penick would have to be dissolved. The party would also lose its  mandates on the Lichtenberg, Marzahn-Hellersdorf and Treptow-K\u00f6penick district  councils. Berlin Mayor, Klaus  Wowereit (SPD), told party members on Sunday that a \"quick ban\" on the NPD is  necessary. The state must guarantee protection for immigrants and all of its  citizens, he said. Not everyone thinks  an outright ban on the NPD is the right move. Oliver Igel, the SPD Mayor of  Treptow K\u00f6penick (an NPD stronghold), told Die Tageszeitung that the problem of  right-wing extremism will not disappear with the  NPD. It's much more  important for society to engage in open debate, he says. A previous attempt  to dissolve the NPD was rejected by the German Constitutional Court in 2003 because  of the presence of police informants in top NPD positions. The court ruled that  the party could not be prohibited as its policies may have been partly shaped by  law enforcement agencies. The NPD failed to win seats on the  Berlin Senate in  September's elections, but gained seats in three district parliaments. It also  came under fire during the election campaign for what were described as  xenophobic campaign  posters.",

The Pirate party won a surprising 8.9 percent of the vote. The Pirate Party's electoral gains in the Berlin senate and district elections proved so unexpected it may not have enough candidates to fill all of its seats. In what was an otherwise largely predictable election, Berlin's Pirate Party (Die Piraten) surpassed expectations and the 5 percent threshold for parliamentary representation with a surprising 8.9 percent of the vote. This is the first time a faction of the Pirate Party, which was founded in 2006, has won seats in a state legislature in Germany. The party, which is modeled on Sweden's Pirate Party, campaigns for copyright reform, free public transport, information privacy, and free wireless internet. The party won 15 seats in the Berlin senate, as well as representation on all 12 of Berlin's district parliaments. It polled at 14.3 percent in Friedrichshain-Kreuzberg, where with just 8 candidates, the party cannot fill all 9 seats it secured. Three Pirate candidates were elected simultaneously to the Friedrichshain-Kreuzberg district parliament as well as the senate. As each political representative is allowed only one mandate, the candidates will have to choose between the senate and the district parliament. Fabio Reinhardt, Oliver H\u00f6finghoff and Alexander Morlang said they will forgo their seats in Friedrichshain-Kreuzberg, which means the party will lose a seat on the district council. (Each district has a parliament with 55 members and a district council made up of the district mayor and four councilors chosen according to the strength of their party faction in the parliament). If they do so, the council seat will go to the Die Linke (The Left) instead. Incumbent Berlin mayor, Klaus Wowereit, secured a third term in office despite electoral losses suffered by his Social Democratic Party (SPD) in the senate elections. The center-left SPD gained a 28.3 percent share of the vote, winning 48 of the 149 seats up for grabs in the senate. This fell short of a projected vote-share of over 30 percent and the 53 seats the party won in the 2006 elections. The SPD's current coalition partner, Die Linke dropped 3 seats bringing its number of representatives down to 20, which raises the prospect that  Wowereit will reach out to either the Greens or the CDU as possible coalition  partners. The Greens increased their number of representatives by 7 to take  30 seats in the senate and will take part in talks with the SPD this week. The  controversial extension of the A100 Motorway around Berlin is the main point of  dispute between the SPD and the Greens. Prior to the elections the Greens ruled  out any coalition with a party that supported the building project, but are now  taking a soft approach so as not to upset talks with its potential coalition  partner. \"We will calmly take part in talks, and then present the results,\"  Bettina Jarasch said, state leader of Berlin's Green Party. Chancellor Angela Merkel's Christian Democrats (CDU) put in a reasonable performance, winning 23.4 percent of the vote. While the CDU polled slightly better then it did in in 2006, the party is unlikely to form a government in the senate. This is the sixth of 7 regional election defeats suffered by the chancellor's ruling party. The CDU's junior coalition  party in the federal government, the liberal FDP, failed to breach the 5  percent threshold for entering the senate. In what was its fifth regional  election defeat this year, the business-friendly party slumped from 7.6 percent of the vote in the last election to just 1.8 percent this time around. The party's drubbing saw them win fewer votes then the more conservative NPD. The FDP's political decline could complicate Merkel's efforts to contain the euro-zone debt crisis amidst increasing dissent flowing from the FDP ranks. FDP leader, Phillip R\u00f6sler, has become increasingly critical of the Chancellor's willingness to use German cash to help heavily indebted EU countries in recent months. The SPD won majorities in four of Berlin's district parliaments, while the CDU topped the polls in five districts. The Greens will be the majority party in Friedrichshain-Kreuzberg, and Die Linke in Marzahn-Hellersdorf and Lichtenberg. Berlin's populist and anti-immigration parties put in a poor showing at the polls. The NPD, Die Freiheit, and B\u00fcrgerbewegung Pro-Deutschland failed to win seats in the senate, while the NPD was the only one of the three to gain seats in the district parliaments. The party, which came under fire during the election campaign for what were described as xenaphobic posters, won seats in Marzahn-Hellersdorf, Lichtenberg and Treptow-K\u00f6penick. Just over 60 percent of Berlin's 2.5 million eligible voters turned out for the election, an increase of about one percent from 2006.",

            "article_content": "Just as the Tea Party drew heavily on a public backlash against government spending, another new political movement \u2014 the Tequila Party \u2014 aims to use the latest crackdown on illegal immigration to motivate Latinos to vote in 2012. Arizona Republican DeeDee Garcia Blase formed the National Tequila  Party Movement as an answer to a Tea Party influence she blames for  increased political opposition to immigration. The group has no aspirations to become a third political party. Its focus will be registering as many of the nation's 21 million voting-age Latinos as it can, targeting young voters in presidential battleground states. Unlike the Tea Party groups, which have generally aligned with Republicans, the Tequila Party pledges no allegiance to either major party. Blase has dropped her affiliation as a lifelong Republican \u2014 and plans to resign as president of Somos Republicans \u2014 to protest the Republican-led immigration enforcement law passed in her home state of Arizona. The Tequila Party held its launch party in Tucson last month. \"It's been very, very frustrating. I'm embarrassed for the state of Arizona and the Republican Party there,\" Blase says. \"I'm a Republican, but I'm a reasonable Republican.\" Arizona's immigration policy has resurfaced this week as Phoenix prepares to host Major League Baseball's All-Star game Tuesday. Latinos, particularly those from other countries, make up roughly a third of big leaguers and nearly half of minor league rosters. The players' union has publicly opposed Arizona's law, but the league itself has remained silent. The law, which is being challenged by the Obama administration in federal court, would tighten the surveillance, prosecution and deportation of suspected illegal immigrants. Stricter versions recently were passed in Alabama and Georgia, and both also are being challenged in federal court. The Tea Party Isn't The Only Target Most of Blase's ire is reserved for Tea Party groups, which she believes have pushed state and congressional Republicans to adopt tougher positions against illegal immigration. \"We have no choice but to empower ourselves and work on a massive national movement to counter the message of the Tea Party. We believe the Tea Party is an anti-immigration movement,\" Blase says. Leaders of the largest national Tea Party groups have insisted their official platform is focused on cutting the federal budget and shrinking government. Mark Meckler, co-founder of  the Tea Party Patriots, one of the largest national groups of its kind, said  immigration \"isn't an issue for us.\" He acknowledged that the organization's  roughly 3,500 chapters take up a wider range of issues affecting their  communities. He said he didn't know of any local affiliates that advocate on  immigration policy. \"At the national level, the  only position we've taken on immigration is that the borders should be secured,\"  Meckler says. \"Once we secure the borders, we can have more legitimate  discussions about those other issues.\" However, smaller Tea Party groups in Arizona, North Carolina and other  states have publicly placed immigration enforcement high on their  advocacy lists. And many Tea Party-backed Republicans in Congress are  leading the crackdown on illegal immigration, such as Rep. Steve King  (R-IA), who has introduced a bill to eliminate automatic citizenship for  children born in the U.S. to illegal immigrants. Many Hispanics have also grown frustrated at Democrats for failing to help push immigration reform bills through Congress. And that failure to pass federal legislation has hurt President Obama's standing among Latinos who looked to him to deliver on his campaign pledge to sign an immigration reform law in his first year in office. In a national survey released in June, 41 percent of Latinos said Obama isn't serious about getting immigration reform passed and that he instead is only \"saying what Hispanics want to hear.\" Half of those polled also faulted congressional Republicans for the failure of reform legislation, while a third of them said Obama hasn't pushed strongly enough for passage. The poll, conducted by Latino Decisions, a California-based firm that tracks opinions of Hispanic voters, also found that immigration was the most important issue for Latino voters, topping jobs and the economy by some 15 points. Last week, a Gallup poll found that Hispanics' support for Obama had declined by nearly a third since 2009, to 52 percent in June. Since President George W. Bush took about 40 percent of the Latino vote in 2004, the Republican Party's hardening line on immigration has led an increasing majority of Hispanics to vote for Democratic candidates. In 2008, Obama took two-thirds of the Hispanic vote, according to the Pew Hispanic  Center. On Tuesday, issues affecting immigrants will be among those addressed in a Hispanic policy forum hosted by the White House. Voter Registration Doesn't Necessarily Equal Voting The Tequila Party faces a big challenge. Although the Latino voting-age population has nearly doubled in the past decade and now stands at 21 million, voter turnout remains anemic. Only 31 percent voted in the 2010 midterm elections \u2014 compared with 50 percent of whites and 44 percent of African-Americans \u2014 according to the Pew Hispanic  Center. The Tequila Party will focus on registering Latinos, particularly in states with rapidly growing Hispanic populations. That will include activism in states with policies that the group believes unfairly target Latinos. These groups trying to organize like the Tea Party show how terribly they misunderstand the Tea Party movement. Nobody chose the name and decided, 'Oh, gosh, we need to start a movement.' It was organic. You can't force these things. They are trying to force something to look like or have a movement like the Tea Party. It's simply not possible. Mark Meckler, Tea Party Patriots First up on a 20-state campaign, on July 29, will be Kansas, where an Arizona-style immigration bill failed to pass the state Legislature this year. But next year, the state will enact a so-called voter ID law, requiring people to present identification at the polls that proves U.S. citizenship. Pursuing a bipartisan approach, Blase has recruited veteran Latino Democratic operatives Fernando Romero of Nevada and Gus Garcia of Miami. Romero, who supported Republican John McCain for president in 2008, is credited with devising the group's name. And Garcia, who was the national Latino co-chair for Hillary Clinton's 2008 presidential campaign, will act as the group's primary political adviser. One problem Latino groups have traditionally faced in mobilizing Hispanics as a voting bloc is the wide array of differing Hispanic ideologies. For instance, Cuban-Americans in south Florida tended to vote Republican because of that party's conservatism and their historic distrust of the Democratic Party following the failed Bay of Pigs invasion under President Kennedy. Yet Mexican-Americans in California have leaned Democratic because of that party's strength in heavily Hispanic urban areas, advocacy of social programs and support for pro-amnesty immigration reforms. The Tequila Party hopes the latest immigration struggles will prove to be a unifying force. Its strategy is to target young voters in 10 presidential battleground states, including Florida, Illinois and California. \"We're the only society in America that gets their political information from the young, because they get the news first,\" Garcia says. \"They are our translators. And they are getting to the point where they are saying 'Where's the beef?' on this issue.\" Historians say U.S. political movements formed along racial or ethnic lines traditionally have met with mixed results for a variety of reasons, starting with the limits of organizing to change one policy. \"Single-issue movements are just that. What else do you have to offer?\" says W. Jelani Cobb, an American history professor at Rutgers  University and author of the 2010 book The Substance of Hope: Barack Obama and the Paradox of Progress. \"To create national infrastructure or state infrastructure is almost impossible these days because it's difficult to get up enough numbers to influence the Electoral College.\" Cobb says voter registration drives are standard fare for many political, civic and advocacy groups, such as the NAACP and the National Council of La Raza, which, respectively, are the oldest African-American and Hispanic civil rights groups. \"Those,\" he says, \"are not all the ingredients for a movement. There's no emotional appeal. Maybe the best thing that can happen for them is some high-profile anti-immigrant xenophobe begins attacking them.\" Cobb says that such extreme opposition has surfaced, but he's \"skeptical\" that it will galvanize Hispanics \"because of the entrenched stability of the two-party system, the difficulty of instituting reform and the short life span of these organizations even when they have charismatic leaders and timely issues.\" Meckler, the co-founder of the Tea Party Patriots, also contends that efforts to duplicate the Tea Party may  fall flat. \"These groups trying to organize like the Tea Party show how  terribly they misunderstand the Tea Party movement. Nobody chose the   name and decided, 'Oh, gosh, we need to start a movement.' It was organic.  You  can't force these things. They are trying to force something to  look like or  have a movement like the Tea Party. It's simply not   possible.\"",
