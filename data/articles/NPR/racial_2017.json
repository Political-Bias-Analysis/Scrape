            "article_content": "by Sam Graham-felsen Hardcover, 301 pages | Your purchase helps support NPR programming. How? It's 1992. Your hair is gelled up, you're sporting high-tops and maybe still listening to Run DMC on cassette. That's the setting for Sam Graham-Felsen's Green, a new coming-of-age novel that's also a look at race in America. It follows a friendship between two adolescent boys in Boston \u2014 one black and one white. \"The narrator is a 12-year-old boy named Dave Greenfeld,\" Graham-Felsen says. \"... He's one of only three white kids in his entire middle school, and the last thing he wants is to also stand out for being Jewish. So he sort of gives himself a nickname, Green.\" On the thing Green describes as \"the force\" So the first time Dave sort of comes up with this concept, he's watching the news on the day of \u2014 or one of the days \u2014 of the LA riots, and there's a particular moment during the LA riots where a guy named Reginald Denny, who was a trucker, was stopped at an intersection where there was a lot of rioting going on. He was pulled out of his truck and beaten, and he was a white guy and presumably targeted because of that. And Dave sees this on TV and he finds himself \u2014 even though he grew up in a very progressive household \u2014 he finds himself sort of rooting for this white trucker. And he feels kind of ashamed and embarrassed of it. And he says that what comes over him is something called \"the force.\" The force is kind of this amorphous thing that intrudes on various aspects of life, and Dave is slowly starting to wake up and realize that the origins of the force are some pretty serious things, like institutional racism. On being the chief blogger for Obama's 2008 campaign and how it informed the book I was helping to further the message of hope and change, and I really felt hopeful that an Obama victory would signal a sea change in America and would bring about real racial progress. I never thought we would turn into a post-racial country overnight, but when I saw the, sort of, enormity and swiftness of the backlash against Obama from the Tea Party, it really gave me pause. I had the kind of idea [for the book] in my head as I was working on the Obama campaign, and then after the campaign I sort of felt more of a sense of urgency. I wanted to explore, you know, why is racism such an intractable problem in this country? And I realized, hey, you know, I have this fairly unique experience as a white kid who went to mostly black schools growing up, and maybe if I dive as deep as possible into my own past, I can kind of understand what happened to me better, and maybe a little bit better about what happened to my city, and even my country. On political similarities between the 1990s and today This book is set in 1992, and I felt like the early '90s in some ways feel so similar to our current moment. There was the explosive incident of the LA riots, which followed the acquittal of the police officers who beat Rodney King brutally on videotape. And you know, we're seeing echoes of incidents like that all the time right now. There was a presidential election that was very racialized, where Bill Clinton famously threw rappers, including Sister Souljah, under the bus in order to appeal to the white working class. And obviously we had a highly racialized presidential election this time around as well. So I mean in some ways it was disheartening to deep dive into the '90s and to see kind of how much things have stayed the same, but there's also a lot of sort of cultural fusion going on, you know, through hip-hop, through the comedy scene. And that kind of cultural mixing gives me hope that the country just very, very slowly is trying to figure out how we can actually not just live together, but thrive together.

Tony Cardenas, D-Calif., on their way to a meeting with members of the Congressional Black Caucus, at the Capitol, on October 12, 2017, in Washington, DC. This week in the Russia investigations: Facebook hits Washington with a P.R. blitz, the imbroglio sucks in more tech giants and the White House weighs how nicely \u2014 or rudely \u2014 to treat Robert Mueller. Facebook Chief Operating Officer Sheryl Sandberg is a billionaire titan of Big Tech who looks down on the world from the peak of empire \u2014 but she tried to sound as contrite as she could this week in Washington. Sandberg visited with members of Congress; did a public Q&A with the insider's insider, Axios reporter Mike Allen; and, according to Politico, met with leaders of African-American, Latino and Muslim-American rights groups all to make clear that Facebook gets it: The social giant played a role in Russia's attack on last year's presidential election, she abhors that role, and that the company will do better down the line. \"Things happened on our platform that shouldn't have happened,\" Sandberg told Allen. But each of her visits appears to have been a little rocky, in its own way. Allen asked, for example, whether any Americans were involved with targeting the ads Facebook sold to Russian influence-mongers. What \"overlap\" has she found between Facebook and people who might have worked for President Trump's campaign? Sandberg did her utmost not to answer. And what about the racially focused, racially divisive ads traced back to Russian accounts? Sandberg's comments to lawmakers went unrecorded but the members of Congress themselves spoke out. \"The manipulation of Facebook by foreign actors to interfere with our elections and fan the flames of racial hatred is an existential threat to our democracy,\" said Rep. Hakeem Jeffries, D-N.Y. \"We cannot allow Facebook and other social media platforms to be used as kerosene, spreading fake news throughout our country designed to misinform and divide the American electorate.\" The content of the ads could appear in public before Nov. 1 hearings scheduled before the House and Senate Intelligence Committees, although Facebook and members of Congress appear to be wrangling about who'll release them and how. In the interim, look for Big Tech to continue trying to set itself up for the softest landing it can manage on Capitol Hill. Russia's overt influence campaign against the U.S. last year \u2014 in addition to its much-discussed covert campaign of spy stuff and cyberattacks \u2014 turns out to have been bigger than anyone knew. Not only did it involve Facebook and Twitter, but Google has discovered that it sold tens of thousands of dollars worth of ads, the company has acknowledged. And remember, this is the Internet we're talking about \u2014 everybody posts stuff everywhere. So, as the Washington Post reported, even if Russian influence-mongers didn't surface material in some places, other users spread it on their own. One key example: Pinterest, which as the Post says is better known as \"the place where people go to get ideas about home decor, fashion and recipes.\" Internet users last year also were taking posts linked to the Russian influence campaign from, say, Facebook, and copying them to their Pinterest boards. There, they took on lives of their own within that separate ecosystem. Likewise on YouTube, which is owned by Google, and on Thursday CNN reported that influence-mongers even operated inside the mobile phone game Pokemon Go. What has vexed congressional and tech investigators, however, is that for as much evidence as they're uncovering about this campaign, there are gaps in what they can confirm. Some of that is because the Russian agents involved here are professionals at disguising their conduct. Some of that is because the data from last year don't exist anymore. About the only thing that is clear to everyone, as one source told NPR this week, is that nobody knows how deep this rabbit hole goes. Special counsel Robert Mueller, center, leaves after a closed meeting with members of the Senate Judiciary Committee on June 21, 2017, at the Capitol in Washington, D.C.\n                \n                    \n                    Alex Wong/Getty Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption Special counsel Robert Mueller, center, leaves after a closed meeting with members of the Senate Judiciary Committee on June 21, 2017, at the Capitol in Washington, D.C. How should the White House staff deal with Justice Department special counsel Robert Mueller? According to reports this week, there are two schools of thought (as Mueller's team continues its investigation including a daylong interview Friday with Reince Priebus): One says be nice. The other says to give him the stiff arm. Team Nice Guys made their case via The New York Times: \"White House officials once debated a scorched-earth strategy of publicly criticizing and undercutting ... Mueller .... Now, President Trump's lawyers are pursuing a different course: cooperating with the special counsel in the hope that Mr. Mueller will declare in the coming months that Mr. Trump is not a target of the Russia inquiry.\" But Team Hard Case fired back soon after via the Associated Press: \"Trump supporters and associates inside and outside the White House see the conciliatory path as risky to the maverick president's tenure. Instead, they want the street-fighting tweeter to criticize Mueller with abandon. The struggle between supporters of the legal team's steady, cooperative approach, and the band of Trump loyalists who yearn for a fight, comes as the Mueller probe begins lapping at the door of the Oval Office. Mueller, who is investigating the firing of former FBI director James Comey and other key actions of the Trump administration, has signaled that his team intends to interview multiple current and former White House officials in the coming weeks and has requested large batches of documents from the executive branch.\" What will be the difference-maker? No one can know but the president. Trump might not decide on any single strategy, or he might not even consider the issue until it flares up again on cable TV news coverage. The way the networks present and frame issues has a huge effect on Trump, reports Politico's Josh Dawsey, and cable news remains one of the most important ways he perceives which things are real and urgent or otherwise. Per Dawsey: \"Sometimes, advisers and people who know him well deliberately engage the media. [Tennessee Sen. Bob] Corker has told others on Capitol Hill that Trump doesn't listen unless he hears the criticism on TV or reads it in the paper. Chris Ruddy, a longtime Trump friend, said on television in June that he thought Trump might fire special counsel Bob Mueller on TV, creating a firestorm \u2014 a calculated attempt to pre-empt what he feared could be a politically fatal move by the president.\" In short, what could help decide this inside the White House may be the decisions of TV producers and executives in New York or Atlanta. The next big milestone for them \u2014 barring unexpected news beforehand \u2014 could be the hearing scheduled for Oct. 25 in which Trump's longtime attorney Michael Cohen is set to appear before the Senate Intelligence Committee.",

No one was injured, but the explosion damaged an imam's office at the Dar Al Farooq Islamic Center in Bloomington, located near Minneapolis. The FBI Minneapolis Field Office is now leading an investigation in cooperation with the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, Bloomington police and other agencies. \"The FBI said the preliminary investigation indicated the explosion was caused by an improvised explosive device, but would not characterize the device further,\" reports Peter Cox of Minnesota Public Radio. \"They said their focus was to determine the 'who and why' behind the incident.\" Bloomington police said they received a call at 5:05 a.m. reporting an explosion. First responders arrived and \"observed some smoke and some damage to a limited portion of the community center,\" Bloomington Police Chief Jeff Potts told reporters. Pictures from the outside show a broken window on the side of the building. The Muslim American Society of Minnesota posted pictures of the damaged office on its Facebook page: \"One of our congregation saw a pickup truck leaving from the parking lot at a very unusual, you know, speed,\" said the mosque's executive director, Mohamed Omar. Faith leaders and community members gathered to denounce the attack. \"An attack on a mosque is an attack on a synagogue is an attack on a church, is an attack on all faith communities,\" Curtiss DeYoung, the CEO of the Minnesota Council of Churches, told reporters. \"And so we stand with you, a million protestants in Minnesota.\" \"The Dar Al Farooq Center welcomes and expresses gratitude to members of different faith-based communities who turned up in large numbers to show their solidarity and support to us in our time of grief,\" the center wrote on its Facebook page, adding, \"United We Stand and Divided We Fall.\" The center has received threatening calls and emails before, Omar told the Star Tribune. Callers have said \"that we shouldn't be here, that we are a burden to the community or we are harming it,\" the newspaper reports. The Muslim American Society of Minnesota and the Minnesota chapter of the Council on American-Islamic Relations are each offering a reward for information leading to an arrest in the case. \"CAIR has noted an unprecedented spike in hate incidents targeting Muslims and other minority groups since the November 8 election,\" the group said in a press release.",

Since then, cities across the South \u2013 and beyond \u2013 have been grappling with what to do with their Confederate symbols. Here's a look at some of the places that have seen major public debate over Confederate memorials in recent months: New Orleans One of the most controversial decisions happened in New Orleans, where four monuments honoring the Confederacy and white supremacy came down earlier this year after tense protests. That decision was supported by New Orleans Mayor Mitch Landrieu \u2014 the city's first white mayor in more than 30 years. \"This is a history we should never forget and one that we should never, ever again put on a pedestal to be revered,\" Landrieu said in a speech praising the monuments' removal. Charlottesville, Va. Over the weekend in Charlottesville, Va., about 1000 counter-protesters surrounded a few dozen KKK members who'd come to town to demonstrate against the planned removal of a statue of Confederate General Robert E. Lee. That was just the latest of several local disputes and over the issue. Richmond, Va. Memorials to Confederate leaders like Thomas \"Stonewall\" Jackson, pictured, Jefferson Davis and Robert E. Lee line Monument Avenue, a stately historic street in downtown Richmond.\n                \n                    \n                    Sarah McCammon/NPR\n                    \n                \nhide caption Memorials to Confederate leaders like Thomas \"Stonewall\" Jackson, pictured, Jefferson Davis and Robert E. Lee line Monument Avenue, a stately historic street in downtown Richmond. In one of the former capitals of the Confederacy \u2013 Richmond, Va. \u2013 the city's young, African-American mayor is trying to compromise. Mayor Levar Stoney recently created a commission charged with finding ways to contextualize memorials to Confederate leaders like Jefferson Davis and Robert E. Lee that line Monument Avenue, a stately historic street downtown. Stoney has suggested adding signs to explain the markers' history or new statues honoring other historical figures. \"Removing monuments doesn't change race relations in our city; I'm just as insulted by those statues as anyone else,\" Stoney said at a press conference discussing the commission. \"But what I'm most insulted by is the fact that those statues currently stand up there without telling an ounce of the truth.\" Baltimore Baltimore's Mayor, Catherine Pugh, has said she also wants to explore removing the city's monument to several Confederate leaders. Her predecessor, Stephanie Rawlings-Blake, had ordered interpretive signs to be placed alongside the monuments, a move she described as a short-term solution at the time. Mississippi Mississippi's state flag includes a Confederate battle symbol.\n                \n                    \n                    Rogelio V.

Mississippi's state flag still incorporates a Confederate battle symbol into its design. For that reason, the city of McComb recently stopped flying the flag \u2013 over some local objection. A black Mississippi resident, Carlos Moore, is challenging the flag in court, arguing that it is a symbol of white supremacy. And the University of Mississippi announced this month that it will put up a sign recognizing that some campus structures were built by slaves. Norfolk, Va. In Norfolk, Va., in late May, someone spray-painted the word \"SHAME\" in giant letters across the city's monument to the \"Confederate Dead,\" which is positioned prominently downtown. Norfolk News \u2018SHAME\u2019 spray-painted on Confederate monument in downtown Norfolk https://t.co/CekRiRVPhn pic.twitter.com/47pNaMeZkd Rayla Young of Virginia Beach was walking by as a city crew cleaned off the paint. Young, who's African-American, said she's resigned to the statue's presence. \"I just walk past it like I don't even see it ... Of course it hurts, but I mean, there's nothing that I can do to tell anybody to take it down,\" Young said. Steve Turner, a white construction worker from North Carolina's Outer Banks, was also passing by. He said there's no need to stir up controversy about things that happened in the past. \"I mean, everything's offensive nowadays. It doesn't matter what you do or what you say, it's still offensive,\" Turner said. \"But it's American history \u2013 it should be left alone.\" \"I hate to say it, but you know, it's getting so bad we are the minority now ... white people are,\" he said. \"Since Obama took over, back then, that's what created all this crap right now.\" Whatever cities do with their Confederate symbols, there will still be deeper racial issues for the nation to confront. Brandy Faulkner, a political science professor at Virginia Tech who studies race and public policy, also points to President Obama's election as a turning point that sparked racial resentment among some white Americans. \"We like to think that we've made so much progress in this area, when in fact we haven't made very much at all. And what happens is the level of resentment grows depending on the visibility of progress,\" Faulkner said. \"So with the election of Barack Obama, we had, for the every first time, a visible symbol of the nation that was African American, and I think it was a shock for so many people.\" Faulkner says taking down monuments, or adding context to the ones that stay up, may temporarily settle local debates \u2013 but the larger conversation about race in America is far from over. \"We have yet as a country to be honest that we are still having a race problem, and until we can have that discussion openly and honestly, I don't think there will be a resolution,\" Faulkner said.",

            "article_content": "Civil rights advocates and Democrats are celebrating after the U.S. Supreme Court ruled Monday that the Republican-controlled North Carolina Legislature had drawn two congressional districts that amount to unconstitutional racial gerrymanders. Election experts say the decision is likely to boost the prospects for success in similar challenges across the South. For more than a quarter century, the Supreme Court has been struggling with the question of race and partisanship in drawing both state and congressional legislative lines. In 1993, the court said partisanship is permissible, but redistricting based on race is not. Since then, the question, increasingly has been how to tell the difference, especially when party affiliation correlates with race, as it does in much of the South. In North Carolina, for instance, roughly two-thirds of white voters cast their ballots for Republicans, while some 90 percent of African-Americans vote Democratic. With Republicans controlling state legislatures throughout the South, experts say the Supreme Court has handed Democrats and civil rights advocates a powerful tool, reviving racial gerrymandering claims once thought futile. \"This case is a big deal because it's going to make it much easier for voting rights plaintiffs, especially in the American South, to challenge gerrymanders that are done by Republican legislatures,\" says Richard Hasen of the University of California, Irvine. The court's decision centered on two congressional districts that previously contained a substantial percentage of African-American voters, but not a majority. After the 2010 census, however, the GOP-controlled North Carolina Legislature reshuffled tens of thousands of black and white voters into and out of the two districts, one around Durham, and the other in a different part of the state snaking from south to north. Writing for the court on Monday, Justice Elena Kagan said the redistricting deliberately concentrated black voters in the two districts and diluted their voting clout in neighboring districts. By a unanimous vote, the justices rejected North Carolina's argument that it was required by the Voting Rights Act to create these two majority black districts. And by a 5-3 vote, the court found that the evidence in the case \"debunked\" the state's contention that in setting racial targets, it was acting not with any racial motive, but only for partisan advantage. Justice Clarence Thomas, the court's most conservative justice, and its only African-American, cast the decisive fifth vote, joining the court's four liberal justices. He agreed that the court correctly deferred to the lower court's \"plausible\" interpretation of the evidence. In addition to the practical consequences that Monday's ruling could have for redistricting in North Carolina in 2018, and in the rest of the country after the 2020 census, there is a fascinating political twist to the North Carolina case. In 1993, it was conservatives who first challenged the state's redistricting plan, arguing successfully that race played an unconstitutionally large role in drawing district lines. Liberal Democrats hated the decision back then; conservatives loved it. But now the sides have flipped, observes UC's Hasen. \"This is a transformation of the racial gerrymandering cases,\" he says. \"It went from a tool being used by conservatives to stop the creation of majority-minority districts to now a tool to try to police Republican gerrymanders in Southern states.\" But what of purely partisan gerrymanders, especially in the rest of the country? In 2004, a four-member Supreme Court plurality all but ruled out challenges to even extreme partisan gerrymanders, while four members of the court would have allowed some limited challenges. Justice Anthony Kennedy cast the fifth and deciding vote, declaring that he might someday embrace a challenge to a partisan gerrymander if someone could come up with workable standards. Now there is a case from Wisconsin waiting in the wings at the Supreme Court \u2014 a case in which the plaintiffs purport to have found such a workable standard. So, as long as Justice Kennedy remains on the court, the possibility of limiting partisan gerrymanders remains a live one.",

(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) FRANCOIS FILLON: (Through interpreter) I'm not asking you to like me but to support me. We're not choosing a buddy. We're choosing a president. KAKISSIS: Fillon is also the only presidential candidate who speaks openly about his faith. He's Catholic, and he told French TV what that means to him. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) FILLON: (Through interpreter) I'm a Christian, meaning I never make a decision that would be contrary to respecting human dignity or solidarity. KAKISSIS: France is officially a secular nation, and only a third of the population identifies with a religion. Many voters are actually turned off by religion, says Pierre Brechon, a political scientist who studies religion in public life. He spoke to NPR via Skype from the French city of Grenoble. PIERRE BRECHON: (Through interpreter) In 1905, back when religion was at the center of political life, France introduced the law of laicite, the concept of constitutional secularism. But religious orientation does still color political views today. UNIDENTIFIED SINGERS: (Singing in French). KAKISSIS: Catholics, Brechon says, tend to vote for conservatives, and Fillon is appealing to them. Fillon's got several supporters in the congregation of La Madeleine, a landmark Roman Catholic Church in a well-heeled neighborhood in central Paris. Emmanuel Alain Cabanis, a professor of medicine at the University of Paris, holds palm fronds as the congregation celebrates Palm Sunday. He says he'd love to hear a fourth word added to the French national motto and says Fillon is the only candidate who seems comfortable with spirituality. EMMANUEL ALAIN CABANIS: I am a Fillon supporter for reason of liberty. I think he's the best guarantee of liberty, equality, fraternity and spirituality. KAKISSIS: And the professor is not swayed by allegations that don't seem very spiritual at all, that Fillon gave his family fake jobs that cost taxpayers hundreds of thousands of euros. MONIQUE GOBERT: (Speaking French). KAKISSIS: Neither is Monique Gobert, a church member who takes care of the flowers here. GOBERT: (Through interpreter) He's a churchgoer. I cannot see him stealing from the state. We gave him a certain amount of money for his campaign to do what he likes. Maybe he paid his wife too much, but he had the right. UNIDENTIFIED CROWD: (Chanting in French). KAKISSIS: Fillon is counting on supporters like these who see him as responsible and moral no matter what. Thousands turned out for his recent rally in Paris, including Silim Mourid, a 29-year-old aviation manager. Mourid is Muslim, and he says he believes Fillon's sense of Christian values also make the presidential candidate appreciative of other religions. SILIM MOURID: (Speaking French). KAKISSIS: \"We have candidates like Marine Le Pen talking about banning Muslims,\" Mourid says. \"There's no getting around religion. We need to talk about it.\" For NPR News, I'm Joanna Kakissis in Paris. Copyright \u00a9 2017 NPR.  All rights reserved.

Yesterday was International Women's Day, a holiday that commemorates the global fight for gender equality and women's rights. It was celebrated across the world with labor strikes, commentaries on the status of women and plenty of posts on social media. Many musicians got involved in the conversation; notably, Beyonce, Coldplay, John Legend, Madonna \u2014 among other artists and activists \u2014 signed an open letter in support of women's rights. The letter, posted by social action platform Global Citizen, calls the fight for gender equality \"the emergency and the opportunity of our time.\" Though its language about the persistent need to fight for women's rights was not particularly new, it was framed as a reaction to increasing threats faced by women in the current political climate. Chime for Change, who sponsored the open letter, is a campaign started by Gucci to raise awareness of (and money for) women's and girls' rights. And it wasn't the only music-and-fashion collaboration of the day; Madonna released \"Her-Story,\" a deeply glamorous (if mildly tone-deaf) short film, made in collaboration with Vogue Italy, about the fight for women's equality. (These collaborations are slightly ironic, given that International Women's Day was originally organized as National Working Women's Day by the Socialist Party of America in honor of protests against working conditions in garment factors.) Elsewhere on the internet, some of music's most famous women shared relatively benign reflections on the holiday \u2014 unsurprising in an era where women musicians are expected to give an enthusiastic \"Yes!\" whenever interviewers ask if they're feminists, but when that response is hardly ever expected to evidence substantive political engagement. Adele tweeted a quotation about female dominance: \"Whatever women do they must do twice as well as men to be thought half as good. Luckily, this is not difficult\" #internationalwomensday pic.twitter.com/3jzQcEpKnH Katy Perry expressed her gratitude for the women in her life: #internationalwomensday \u2764\ud83c\udf39\u2757 pic.twitter.com/jw3MsPh5rn Nicki Minaj gave herself props for reaching a feminist milestone... kinda: she tied Aretha Franklin for most singles among women on the Billboard Hot 100: A post shared by Nicki Minaj (@nickiminaj) on Mar 8, 2017 at 8:53am PST Britney Spears took a moment to express her love for two \"of the many women who inspire\" her: .@Madonna & @Beyonce... 2 of the many women who inspire me. Always fierce throughout their careers. Thank you for being amazing \ud83d\udc96 Happy #IWD pic.twitter.com/tJsqNhuvaV Beyonce telegraphed her admiration for an inspiring woman, albeit one with less star power than Britney's picks. Bey shared a blog post that honored Lynn Clark, the executive director of Habitat for Humanity of Greater Baton Rouge, who has been helping to rebuild the city following a massive flood in August 2016. It's fitting, as Beyonce has family roots in Louisiana, and the state has become a cornerstone of her recent music and charity work. International Women's Day brought expressions of social media solidarity from many male artists who were happy to renew their allyship credentials \u2014 mainly by reminding fans how much they love their moms: Bon Iver & #2ABillion stand w/ @womensmarch in making March 8 a #DayWithoutAWoman on this International Women\u2019s Day https://t.co/FS7MO0kZ2l pic.twitter.com/DbFSVyrbOS The group that organized January's post-inauguration Women's March called for a general strike on International Women's Day, aptly named \"A Day Without A Woman.\" Questions about whether musicians could or would strike are complicated and invoke larger questions about when art counts as work, what women artists' silence means and what artists owe their fans. When women's voices are already underrepresented in many areas of music, would these musicians' silence force things to shut down \u2014 as the strike intends \u2014 or further marginalize their perspectives? In an interview with MTV News, Laetitia Tamko of Vagabon said, \"I'm always striking every day! I strike by existing, by demanding respect, by forcing my way into places that people make it difficult for women \u2014 all women \u2014 to be in and to thrive in. That feels like resistance, personally.\" Other artists, like Margo Price and Katie Bennett of Free Cake for Every Creature, told MTV that striking from music would be akin to silencing themselves in an industry that needs more women's voices to be heard. Still, some musicians publicly supported the strike. Sia, for example, posted a call to action to join on Instagram. A DAY WITHOUT WOMEN. #RESIST - Team Sia A post shared by SIA (@siathisisacting) on Mar 7, 2017 at 5:20pm PST Some musicians chose to tackle more complicated aspects of the feminist struggle. Folk duo First Aid Kit released a fiery rebuke of rape culture, called \"You Are The Problem Here.\" It's direct in its exasperation with entitled men, with lyrics like \"You are the problem here / No one made you do anything / That's not how liquor works ... And I hope you fucking suffer.\" Songwriter and activist Taina Asili released a protest song and video, called \"No Es Mi Presidente,\" about interconnected feminist struggles. In an interview with Rolling Stone, Asili explains that the video is a means of pushing back against the forces of \"white supremacy, patriarchy, the desecration of sacred sites and harm to our earth.\" The song is in both English and Spanish; Asili explains that \"as the Trump regime has taken hold, Latinos in this country are being targeted,\" so she \"wanted to use this language as a voice to express our dissent, our resistance.\" Downtown Boys's Victoria Ruiz, who has been involved with the pushback against SXSW's immigration language, shared some more terse thoughts on the racial divide in last year's election and its relation to the feminist movement. In Seattle, members of Russian political punk group Pussy Riot appeared at a rally for women's economic and social equality, focused mainly on access to healthcare and union organizing rights, before playing a show later that night. Other musicians took International Women's Day as an opportunity to speak out about the challenges that gender inequality poses to nonbinary and trans people. Musician Mal Blum, who uses they/them pronouns, posted about the persistent misgendering they receive from the media. The most inspiring and emoji-studded message of the day, though, probably \u2014 and not all that surprisingly \u2014 came from Cher.

President Obama reflected on the achievements of his eight years in the White House on Tuesday night, telling supporters in his hometown of Chicago that they were instrumental in helping him boost the nation's economy, create his signature health care reform law and extend equal rights to more Americans: \"If I had told you eight years ago that America would reverse a great recession, reboot our auto industry, and unleash the longest stretch of job creation in our history, if I had told you that we would open up a new chapter with the Cuban people, shut down Iran's nuclear weapons program without firing a shot, and take out the mastermind of 9/11, if I had told you that we would win marriage equality, and secure the right to health insurance for another 20 million of our fellow citizens \u2014 you might have said our sights were set a little too high. \"But that's what we did. That's what you did. You were the change. You answered people's hopes, and because of you, by almost every measure, America is a better, stronger place than it was when we started.\" The roughly one-hour farewell address was replete with the kind of soaring, hopeful rhetoric that propelled a first-term, 47-year-old senator to the Oval Office eight years ago and got him re-elected four years ago. He reflected on his roots as community organizer and how the Windy City had shaped who he was as a man and as a public servant. And he grew emotional at points, especially when he thanked his wife, Michelle, daughters Sasha and Malia and Vice President Biden. \"That faith I placed all those years ago, not far from here, in the power of ordinary Americans to bring about change \u2014 that faith has been rewarded in ways I couldn't possibly have imagined. I hope yours has, too,\" the president said. But Obama also acknowledged the country's deep divisions that have been exposed by a tumultuous election and defended the very foundations of democracy in the U.S. and abroad, just a week before President-elect Donald Trump is sworn in. \"For too many of us, it's become safer to retreat into our own bubbles, whether in our neighborhoods or college campuses or places of worship or our social media feeds, surrounded by people who look like us and share the same political outlook and never challenge our assumptions,\" the president said. \"The rise of naked partisanship, increasing economic and regional stratification, the splintering of our media into a channel for every taste \u2014 all this makes this great sorting seem natural, even inevitable. And increasingly, we become so secure in our bubbles that we accept only information, whether true or not, that fits our opinions, instead of basing our opinions on the evidence that's out there.\" He added emphatically: \"This trend represents a third threat to our democracy. Politics is a battle of ideas; in the course of a healthy debate, we'll prioritize different goals, and the different means of reaching them. But without some common baseline of facts; without a willingness to admit new information, and concede that your opponent is making a fair point, and that science and reason matter, we'll keep talking past each other, making common ground and compromise impossible.\" It was the most direct allusion the president would make toward his successor and his supporters, coming the same day that stories broke that top U.S. intelligence officials had documents alleging collusion between Russia and the president-elect. Trump has denied those allegations. Obama mentioned the incoming commander in chief by name only once, saying, \"I committed to President-elect Trump that my administration would ensure the smoothest possible transition, just as President Bush did for me.\" Obama quieted the crowd's boos when he added, \"In 10 days, the world will witness a hallmark of our democracy: The peaceful transfer of power from one freely elected president to the next.\" But with Obama's later comments about the future of democracy, it was clear he had concerns about the president-elect's rhetoric on foreign adversaries, such as Russia, and throughout the campaign, especially against Muslim-Americans. \"Democracy can buckle when we give in to fear. So just as we, as citizens, must remain vigilant against external aggression, we must guard against a weakening of the values that make us who we are. That's why, for the past eight years, I've worked to put the fight against terrorism on a firm legal footing. That's why we've ended torture, worked to close Gitmo, and reform our laws governing surveillance to protect privacy and civil liberties. That's why I reject discrimination against Muslim-Americans,\" Obama said, drawing a sustained standing ovation from the crowd. \"So let's be vigilant, but not afraid,\" the president continued. \"ISIL will try to kill innocent people. But they cannot defeat America unless we betray our Constitution and our principles in the fight. Rivals like Russia or China cannot match our influence around the world \u2014 unless we give up what we stand for, and turn ourselves into just another big country that bullies smaller neighbors.\" Obama reflected on his own historic place as the country's first African-American president, but he admitted that his election did not do away with racial tensions \u2014 and that it never was going to. \"After my election, there was talk of a post-racial America. Such a vision, however well-intended, was never realistic,\" Obama said. \"For race remains a potent and often divisive force in our society. I've lived long enough to know that race relations are better than they were 10, or 20 or 30 years ago \u2014 you can see it not just in statistics, but in the attitudes of young Americans across the political spectrum.\" Ultimately, the theme of Obama's speech was one encouraging all Americans \u2014 regardless of race, religion or political beliefs \u2014 to come together and focus on what unites them, rather than divides them. \"Understand, democracy does not require uniformity. Our founders quarreled and compromised, and expected us to do the same,\" Obama said. \"But they knew that democracy does require a basic sense of solidarity \u2014 the idea that for all our outward differences, we are all in this together; that we rise or fall as one.\" Telling the country, \"It has been the honor of my life to serve you,\" Obama said his service wasn't over and that he looked forward to contributing \"as a citizen, for all my days that remain.\" \"For now, whether you're young or young at heart, I do have one final ask of you as your president \u2014 the same thing I asked when you took a chance on me eight years ago. I am asking you to believe. Not in my ability to bring about change \u2014 but in yours,\" he said. Obama ended with a familiar refrain, looking both back and ahead: \"Yes we can. Yes we did. Yes we can.\"",

            "article_content": "The Supreme Court upheld the rejection of two congressional districts in North Carolina by a lower court. The lower court ruled the districts had been unlawfully drawn to diminish the voting power of African Americans and ordered them redrawn.  AUDIE CORNISH, HOST: Now to a decision from the U.S. Supreme Court that's likely to affect how congressional and state legislative districts are drawn. Today, the court ruled that North Carolina's Republican-controlled legislature redrew two of the state's congressional districts based on race. The court said that amounted to an unconstitutional racial gerrymander. Election experts said the decision could help similar challenges in other southern states. NPR legal affairs correspondent Nina Totenberg reports. NINA TOTENBERG, BYLINE: More than a quarter-century ago, the Supreme Court ruled that drawing legislative district lines based on race is unconstitutional. But, the court said, gerrymandering district lines does not violate the Constitution when it's done to gain partisan advantage. The question increasingly has been how do you tell the difference, especially when party affiliation correlates with race as it does in much of the South? Today, the high court ruled that placing a substantial number of voters inside or outside a district because of their race is forbidden, even when, as here the state contends, it acted not with a racial motive but to gain partisan advantage. In North Carolina, roughly two-thirds of white voters are Republican and about 90 percent of black voters cast their ballots most often for Democrats. In one congressional district, the Republican-controlled state legislature had to add about 100,000 more voters after the 2010 census. It did that by adding mostly black voters to the district from the heavily black neighborhood of Durham and creating a district that now was majority black instead of a district with a substantial but minority share of black voters. The state maintained that it was required to do that under the Voting Rights Act, but today the Supreme Court unanimously rejected that argument, as it has in similar cases from Alabama and Virginia. A second district, District 12, which has been the subject of Supreme Court litigation five times, did not need to add or subtract voters after the census. But the state legislature nonetheless added 35,000 African-Americans to the district and subtracted 50,000 whites of voting age. The result created another black-majority district. Writing for the court, Justice Elena Kagan said that this reshuffling of voters had the effect of packing black voters into two districts and diluting the clout that black voters had in neighboring districts. Justice Clarence Thomas, the court's most conservative justice and the only African-American on the court, provided the fifth vote in the case. Dissenting were Justices Samuel Alito, joined by Justice Anthony Kennedy and Chief Justice John Roberts. Justice Neil Gorsuch did not participate in the case. Election experts across the board said that the decision in North Carolina is a very significant one. Richard Hasen teaches election law at the University of California, Irvine. RICHARD HASEN: This case is a big deal because it's going to make it much easier for voting rights plaintiffs, especially in the American South, to challenge gerrymanders that are done by Republican legislatures. TOTENBERG: Marc Elias, who successfully argued the case on behalf of a Democratic group headed by former Attorney General Eric Holder, was elated. MARC ELIAS: I think that today is a warning siren to Republican legislatures that they are not going to be able to engage in the kind of cynical racial gerrymandering that they've engaged in the past without being held accountable in court. TOTENBERG: In addition to all the practical consequences that today's ruling could have for redistricting in North Carolina in 2018 and the rest of the country after the 2020 census, there is a fascinating political twist to today's Supreme Court decision. A quarter of a century ago it was conservatives who challenged the redistricting plan in North Carolina and elsewhere, arguing successfully that race played an unconstitutionally large role in drawing district lines. In recent years, observes UC's Hasen, the sides have flipped. HASEN: This is a transformation of the racial gerrymandering case. It's been progressing. It went from a tool being used by conservatives to stop the creation of majority-minority districts to now a tool to try to pull these Republican gerrymanders in southern states. TOTENBERG: Liberal Democrats who hated the earlier decisions are now celebrating this one. Nina Totenberg, NPR News, Washington. Copyright \u00a9 2017 NPR.  All rights reserved.

Jason Isbell may not have his own key to Nashville's beloved RCA Studio A, but he is someone who can head in by the back door, warmly greeted by an engineer. That Isbell seems to have the run of the place isn't surprising: After all, this was where the guitar-slinging singer-songwriter and his band, The 400 Unit, crafted a brand-new album that also pays tribute to this space. The album's title, The Nashville Sound, refers to the velvety production style made famous in part by legendary guitarist and producer Chet Atkins in the very same studio in the 1960s. All records made during that period carry a proud label: \"Recorded in RCA's Nashville Sound studio, Nashville, Tennessee.\" \"That particular era's gone,\" Isbell says, \"and it still remains that there's gonna have to be something that represents the way music that comes out of Nashville sounds.\" Since his last album, Something More Than Free, topped the folk, country and rock charts in 2015, Isbell has reached an undeniable level of visibility. It's made him think about how he represents the Southern music scene he's part of, and the South in general. Growing up in rural Alabama, Isbell didn't leave the region until he was out of high school. Tours with the Southern rock band Drive-By Truckers took him to New York City, and the hectic, intimidating pace there made him reluctant to venture out. The turning point? \"When curiosity defeated my fear,\" he says. \"When I wanted to know what was out there more than I was afraid of it killing me, that's when I really made a step in the right direction.\" During his time with the Truckers, Isbell also took note of how the band's more experienced songwriters humanized the Southern characters they wrote about. He refined his own approach to portraying blue-collar people like his dad, who Isbell says \"gave up on politics years and years ago.\" \"He's put in decades of work, either making other people money or doing more work than he was getting paid for,\" Isbell says. \"That's really, I think, who I'm talking about, [though] maybe not who I'm always talking to.\" An empathetic songwriter, Isbell renders the characters in his lyrics with intimate detail, a practice that acclaimed novelist Walter Kirn appreciates. \"He gives everyone a kind of distinctiveness that doesn't occlude or obscure their individuality,\" Kirn says. \"One of the reasons I feel he's such a necessary artist for these times is that in an age when people are kind of all in their bubbles and their little social media isolation chambers, he \u2014 like Walt Whitman did, say \u2014 gives us a portrait of ourselves as a collective, piece by piece, person by person.\" Isbell sings in the first-person, and there's often a lot of him in his characters. After he and his wife, Amanda Shires (who also plays fiddle in The 400 Unit), had their daughter, and after watching the 2016 presidential election stir up anger and resentment around issues of race, he was moved to make some political statements of his own \u2014 like on the songs \"White Man's World\" and \"Hope The High Road.\" \"Doors are open to me and I'll be damned if I'm not gonna walk through 'em,\" Isbell says, \"but I'm also gonna try to hold 'em for somebody else before they slam in their face.\" The very least he can do, Isbell says, is discuss sensitive issues of race and politics with people. And in this, he has an edge: His audience, captivated by his lyricism, is more likely to listen than ever.",

DOJ veterans took note for a different reason: the fact that Kellyanne Conway, a counselor to President Trump, had ventured down Pennsylvania Avenue and past Justice Department security to hear the announcement in person. It's unusual for a White House adviser to appear at a news conference about an enforcement matter. And for Trump administration critics in Congress and out, it's yet another example of how the administration is refusing to respect the independence of the Justice Department. \"Although we've had attorneys general who view their job as serving the president and as an extension of the White House, I do not believe that's the job of the attorney general,\" Sen. Dianne Feinstein, the top Democrat on the Senate Judiciary Committee, said in a hearing last week, one day after the fentanyl event. \"The attorney general's master is the people and the law.\" Matthew Miller, who led the Justice Department's public affairs office during the tenure of President Barack Obama's long-serving attorney general, Eric Holder, said he could not recall a time when an Obama White House official traveled to the Justice Department to hear an enforcement announcement that was being livestreamed online. \"It sends a message that these law enforcement activities are coordinated, directed by the White House,\" Miller said. \"It's an appearance thing.\" Ian Prior, a spokesman for the Trump DOJ, told NPR in a written statement: \"The Department of Justice is an agency in the Executive Branch and the President, like presidents before and after, is free to communicate with Executive Branch appointees.\" As for Conway, Prior said: \"It is concerning that lawmakers would be so offended by an administration official, who is focused on the opioid crisis, being in the crowd at an open press event where opioid related prosecutions were publicly announced. Perhaps the better focus would be on how to address a drug crisis that saw 64,000 people overdose in 2016.\" But for Democrats on Capitol Hill, and veterans of Democratic administrations, it is the pattern of breaches that matters. They're asking why President Trump took the step of interviewing U.S. attorney candidates in Washington, D.C., and New York, venues that have legal jurisdiction to investigate his government and business activities. Preet Bharara, the former U.S. attorney in Manhattan who was fired by Trump earlier this year, told WNYC's Brian Lehrer Show on Wednesday that those meetings are cause for concern. \"It's a terrible look for the president,\" Bharara said. \"It doesn't inspire confidence in the president.\" Bharara's remarks follow an MSNBC interview with Holder earlier this week, when Holder asserted, \"The Justice Department really is different from other Cabinet agencies,\" because of its law-enforcement investigations into public corruption, financial fraud and other sensitive subjects. \"There has to be a wall,\" Holder said, between political operatives in the White House and investigators at Justice. And, he added: \"History has shown us that when that wall is too low, that's when Justice departments get in trouble.\" Former Deputy Attorney General Sally Yates, who was fired by Trump in January after she refused to defend the administration's travel ban, has said she's been alarmed by the president's public berating of Sessions, whose recusal from the investigation into Russian election interference seemed to send Trump into a rage. \"I believe that Attorney General Sessions respects the role of the Department of Justice, and it's really going to be up to him to protect the institution of the Department of Justice,\" Yates, who spent 27 years at the Justice Department as a career prosecutor, told All Things Considered in July. In his confirmation hearing this year, Sessions pledged to respect Justice Department traditions. But last week, in his first oversight hearing in front of the Senate Judiciary Committee, he cited the possibility the White House would invoke executive privilege in refusing to answer several questions. The attorney general said he could not discuss conversations he had before the president fired FBI Director James Comey and a separate instance, in which, the Washington Post reported, Trump asked Sessions to short-circuit the prosecution of former Arizona Sheriff Joe Arpaio. The Justice Department proceeded with the case, and Trump later pardoned Arpaio.",

Circuit.\n                \n                    \n                    Alex Wong/Getty Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption Deputy White House counsel Gregory Katsas  is the leading candidate for the seat on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit. Deputy White House counsel Gregory Katsas is the leading candidate for a judgeship in one of the most important federal appeals courts in the nation, NPR has learned. While the White House has not yet named its pick for the seat on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit, a Katsas nomination would open the door to confirmation hearings that could plumb a series of legal controversies from the first six months of the Trump administration. Katsas, 52, appears to want the post and it may be his for the taking, according to three legal sources familiar with the vacancy. Katsas ran the Justice Department's Civil Division during the George W. Bush presidency. Earlier, he served as executive editor of the Harvard Law Review and clerked for Justice Clarence Thomas during his first year on the Supreme Court. Katsas' White House biography says he's argued more than 75 appeals including cases in the high court and \"every federal appellate court.\" But it's Katsas' work for President Trump this year that could overtake all that other experience in any Senate hearing. Katsas served on the Justice Department transition team before becoming the right-hand man to White House counsel Donald McGahn after the inauguration this year. The two men had worked together before, as partners at the Jones Day law firm in Washington, D.C. By all accounts, inside the tumultuous Trump White House, McGahn has depended on Katsas for legal advice and day-to-day management of the White House legal operation that includes more than two dozen attorneys. The administration has had a rough time in the legal arena. Trump had to withdraw his first executive order banning visitors from seven majority-Muslim countries after courts imposed a temporary halt, and signaled it might be unconstitutional. The new, revised version also met with legal challenges, which the Supreme Court will hear in October. Another judge issued a nationwide injunction over the Trump executive order that threatened to pull funds from so-called sanctuary cities, which decline to share certain information with federal immigration authorities. Attorney General Jeff Sessions eventually issued guidance limiting the scope of the White House order. Then, there's the stormy relationship between the White House and the Justice Department, a role typically managed by the White House Counsel's Office. The president fired FBI Director James Comey in May, with nearly seven years left to go on his 10-year-term. Trump gave conflicting reasons for the dismissal, finally telling an interviewer at NBC News he let go of Comey to relieve pressure over the DOJ investigation into Russian interference in last year's election. Yet, the pressure only intensified after the Justice Department named a special counsel to lead the Russia probe, which the president has called a \"witch hunt\" and a waste of time. Meanwhile, Justice Department veterans from previous administrations have blown the whistle over what they said are violations of long-standing policy that's supposed to protect law enforcement independence by barring most people in the White House from inquiring about ongoing investigations. New White House communications director Anthony Scaramucci recently told The New Yorker he had consulted with DOJ and FBI about leak investigations. And chief of staff Reince Priebus reportedly pulled aside an FBI official to ask about Russia earlier this year. In a confirmation hearing for a lifetime-tenured judgeship, especially on the D.C. Circuit which is known as a \"feeder\" court for the U.S. Supreme Court, all of those issues could be fair game, veterans of the judicial nominations process said. Katsas could be asked about his involvement, knowledge and advice on a host of controversies, though the White House could decide to assert legal privileges over his communications with the president. There's no dispute about his pedigree. He graduated from top schools, won an award for his previous Justice Department service and, in fact, has played an important role in meeting and vetting Trump's picks so far for the federal courts. Filling court vacancies is a preoccupation for the president, who told an audience on Long Island, N.Y., Friday, \"We need to have those judges quickly.\" At the end of a month where Trump has attacked his attorney general, his deputy attorney general and the acting director of the FBI, one of the few legal-related mechanisms that appears to be functioning smoothly is the president's judicial nominations process. With the Senate under Republican control, Trump has won relatively easy confirmation for Supreme Court Justice Neil Gorsuch and three other lower-court judges already this year. The White House has selected more than two dozen other nominees awaiting hearings and Senate votes. Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Charles Grassley, R-Iowa, said in a tweet this week that the remainder of his calendar this year would be devoted to confirming judges and sub-Cabinet level nominees. At the White House, spokeswoman Kelly Love told NPR, \"we do not have any official announcements at this time.\"",

By day, Don McGahn is a straight-laced lawyer, but by night, he's a long-haired rocker. In the White House drama that occupies almost every news day \u2014 from the firing of the FBI director, to the Russia probe, to the controversial travel bans \u2014 there is one crucial name that hardly ever is mentioned publicly: Don McGahn. He is the White House counsel, the president's official lawyer, and his job description puts him at the center of every legal decision made in the White House. McGahn is filling some impressive shoes as the president's counsel. Some of the most respected lawyers in the country have served in the job, beginning in 1943 when President Franklin Delano Roosevelt created the office and appointed as its first occupant Sam Rosenman, a formidable New York lawyer and former judge who moved easily in the corridors of power. McGahn, in contrast to most of his predecessors, however, is not widely known \u2014 even in conservative Republican circles. Indeed, in some ways he is an odd fit, or at least, like the president he serves, an unconventional one. Lawyer by day, rocker by night McGahn's friends joke that he has something of a split personality. By day, a straight-laced lawyer, and by night, a long-haired rocker, the former guitarist for Scott's New Band, which performed all over the Mid-Atlantic states for more than a decade \u2014 until Aug. 25 of last year. By day, Don McGahn is straight-laced lawyer, but by night, he's a long-haired rocker. That day, two things happened: The Trump campaign announced McGahn as its general counsel, and the band announced it was retiring. Now, McGahn finds himself the man in the middle, as the Trump administration lurches from one controversy to another, and as parallels are increasingly drawn \u2014 fairly or unfairly \u2014 to the Watergate scandal that sent top White House aides to jail and drove President Richard Nixon out of office. If there is a single word most frequently used to describe McGahn, it is \"iconoclast,\" defined in multiple dictionaries as a person who attacks settled or cherished beliefs and institutions, a \"cynic,\" \"nonbeliever\" or \"nonconformist.\" That is certainly the role he played when Republican Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell chose McGahn to serve as one of three Republicans on the Federal Election Commission, the government agency charged with enforcing campaign-finance regulations. The three Democrats on the FEC soon saw the three Republicans voting in lockstep as never before. The result: a deadlocked commission that didn't enforce much in the way of campaign-finance rules. That, at least, is the view of Democratic Commissioner Ellen Weintraub. \"McGahn came in with the mission of trying to make the agency as ineffective as possible,\" she said. McGahn, a libertarian, never tried to hide his antipathy for campaign-finance regulation. In one infamous incident, he became so angry that he literally tore up the agency's rule book and threw the pieces across the table at a Democratic commissioner. He may have led the charge, becoming chairman of the commission in the process, but even some Democratic election lawyers concede that he was carrying out the wishes of the Republican congressional leadership. Still, he was uncommonly good at exploiting potential loopholes in the campaign-finance law. Now, he is in charge of dozens of legal issues at the White House, including ensuring that its staff and the president's appointees across government comply with the nation's ethics laws and regulations. Some see that as something of a \"fox-in-the-chicken-coop\" role for the former FEC chairman. \"McGahn seemed to really enjoy trying to find ways around the rules,\" Weintraub said. \"I don't know what kind of advice somebody like that is giving.\" Leonard Leo, executive vice president of the conservative Federalist Society, responded that McGahn is \"the right person to be counsel to the president,\" because \"he has the trust and confidence of Mr. Trump, and that's probably the most important skill or attribute.\" Leo noted that in a job that often requires a fast legal opinion with little time to research, character and good judgment are essential \u2014 qualities that he said McGahn has demonstrated time and again. \"Every day, the White House counsel has to say, 'No' to the president, to explain to his boss that either he can't do what he wants to do, or he has to do it differently,\" Leo observed. Parallels to Watergate Ethics watchdog Fred Wertheimer contends that Trump's administration has \"gotten dangerously close\" to some of the problems that Nixon did in Watergate. \"The smoking gun in the Watergate scandals was a White House tape in which President Nixon was caught laying out the plan to get the CIA to intervene with the FBI to block an FBI investigation of Watergate,\" Wertheimer said. \"Here, President Trump has gotten dangerously close to the line of doing the same thing.\" Indeed, at a Senate hearing last month, a clearly uncomfortable director of national intelligence, Dan Coats, declined to comment on news reports that the president tried to enlist him and the head of the National Security Agency in getting the FBI to shut down the Russia investigation. But when Sen. Richard Blumenthal, D-Conn., pressed the issue, asking Coats if he had discussed the matter with the NSA chief, there was an eight-second silence before Coats haltingly said he \"would like to withhold that question at this particular time.\" Two weeks earlier, former acting Attorney General Sally Yates testified that she warned McGahn, less than a week after Trump was sworn in, that Trump's national security adviser Michael Flynn was subject to blackmail by the Russians. She said she told McGahn that the Justice Department had evidence Flynn had lied to Vice President Pence about the nature of his discussions with the Russian ambassador when President Barack Obama was still in office. Yates quoted the White House counsel as asking, \"Why does it matter to DOJ if one White House official lies to another White House official?\" She said she had explained to him, \"To state the obvious, you don't want your national security adviser compromised with the Russians.\" Despite the warning, Flynn wasn't fired until 18 days later. Shortly after Yates' public testimony in May, Trump fired FBI Director James Comey. The president ultimately admitted he did it, at least in part, because of his dissatisfaction with the Russia probe, and not, as the White House had originally claimed, because of Comey's conduct in the Clinton email investigation. And this week, Comey's testimony on Capitol Hill has become one of those rare mega news events that is so high profile that at least one of the commercial networks, CBS, is planning to carry the testimony live in place of its usual entertainment fare. \"The job of the White House counsel is, in part, to prevent and protect the president from getting into these dangerous situations,\" said Wertheimer, president of Democracy 21, a group that advocates for ethics and transparency in government. \"One of two things is happening here,\" he contended. \"Either the White House counsel is out of the loop and doesn't know when these things are happening, or the White House counsel does know, and he either isn't trying to prevent it or can't prevent it.\" Although Trump, at McGahn's urging, has now hired a private lawyer to represent him in these investigations, the White House counsel just might be reading up on the Watergate scandals. After all, the 48-year-old McGahn was in grade school when revelations of those abuses of power riveted the country for nearly two years. Back then, the White House counsel's office was a very different animal from what it is today. Back then, the job was not nearly as important. There were just three lawyers in the office then, compared to today's 30-plus. But most importantly, back then, there were no clear lines about the role of the White House counsel. \"During Watergate, I wasn't sure who my client was,\" said John Dean, who served as White House counsel to Nixon and went to jail for the role he played in Watergate. The president \"thought I was his private lawyer, as well as some kind of White House lawyer,\" he adds ruefully. Dean noted that in the aftermath of the scandal, the American Bar Association enacted a new code of ethics, which has been adopted nationally. It makes clear that the counsel to the president represents the institution of the presidency, not the president personally. And yet, Dean added, despite this clear division of responsibility, the White House counsel \"has got to be aware of what's going on, so he can protect the office,\" and to protect the office, the counsel \"should ask for information.\" The same rules apply to corporate legal counsel when a corporation's CEO is being investigated for his personal conduct, Dean observed. Moreover, he noted, there is no lawyer-client privilege requiring confidentiality in these situations. If the White House counsel learns of wrongdoing, Dean said, he or she has an obligation to disclose the misconduct. McGahn's allies say he is fully able to thread the narrow eye of that needle. \"Sometimes you're going to have to make seat-of-the pants determinations and judgments,\" said the Federalist Society's Leo. \"Don does, I think, as good a job of that as any White House counsel has.\" For this story, NPR talked to more than a dozen people, including former White House counsels, officials from the Department of Justice and McGahn's former law partners. Strikingly, most of those who know and like McGahn \u2014 even Democratic lawyers \u2014 asked not to be quoted by name. The reason? They do business with the White House or the Trump business empire. Leo is an exception. He points to one of McGahn's signal successes: the appointment and confirmation of now-Justice Neil Gorsuch to the Supreme Court. Unlike the rest of the Trump administration rollout, Gorsuch's confirmation process \u2014 with Leo as the outside man and McGahn as the inside man \u2014 was flawlessly executed, a no-drama affair. And the conservative effect on the Supreme Court will likely be profound. Indeed, McGahn's job is to supervise not only the selection and vetting of Supreme Court nominees, but also the filling of some 130 judicial vacancies in the lower federal courts. That number is unusually large because Senate Republicans refused to bring to a vote many judicial nominees in the final years of the Obama administration. The prospect of McGahn's very conservative hand in filling these court seats now sends shivers of horror down the backs of many Democratic lawyers, and some moderate Republicans as well. But so far, McGahn's choices have delighted the GOP conservative base, from social conservatives to big business. Handling the travel ban and other problems Less pleasing is the way the White House has handled a significant number of legal issues. It is hard to determine how much of the blame for that goes legitimately to McGahn, given the chaotic nature of the Trump presidency. But part of the job of the White House counsel is to prevent legal fiascos. The first of these, the travel ban, was an executive order signed by the president a week after taking office. It initially and temporarily barred people from seven predominantly Muslim countries from entering the U.S. The order, written without consulting the relevant agencies, was so poorly drafted that it even barred green-card holders from returning home after visits abroad. After briefly paralyzing a number of airports, both in the U.S. and elsewhere, the order was struck down by five district courts and a federal appeals court. Eventually, the president signed a second executive order, which he later characterized with disdain as \"watered down.\" But that travel ban, too, has been struck down and is already pending at the Supreme Court. Leo defends McGahn's handling of the travel bans. \"The role of the White House counsel's office,\" he insisted, \"is simply to look at the proposed executive order and determine whether or not that order is legal on its face.\" Former White House counsels from both parties disagree. They argue that McGahn should have taken into account Trump's problematic statements made during the campaign, and after his election, promising to ban Muslims \u2014 statements that later doomed the ban as, among other things, based on religious discrimination. McGahn is also tasked with enforcing compliance with ethics rules. That job has proved particularly nettlesome because of Trump's business empire \u2014 and the role his children play in that empire and in the White House. Also complicating McGahn's job is the fact that many of the individuals tapped for top administration jobs have never served in government, and their private businesses and holdings present potential or actual conflicts of interest. While former White House counsels say that they always worked closely with the Office of Government Ethics to ensure compliance with ethics laws throughout the government, McGahn has clashed repeatedly with the ethics office. Inside the White House, McGahn has assembled what both admirers and critics say is a crackerjack legal team of more than 30 lawyers, including former Supreme Court law clerks, former Justice Department officials, lawyers who staffed the Senate Judiciary Committee and former partners in prominent law firms. McGahn supporters call him a stand-up guy, who is \"taking the bullet\" in conversations with Trump when he has to. For instance, when the first travel order was struck down and Trump tweeted an escalating series of attacks on the judiciary, Supreme Court nominee Gorsuch was quoted as telling senators privately that he found attacks on the judiciary \"disheartening\" and \"demoralizing.\" The comments were widely seen as an attempt by the nominee and his handlers to distance Gorsuch from Trump's remarks. Trump, according to knowledgeable sources, was furious \u2014 and McGahn defused the situation by taking the blame. Role in climate-change withdrawal McGahn has often in this young presidency found himself in the middle of big policy fights in the White House. Most recently, he advised Trump to withdraw from the Paris climate accord, telling him it could jeopardize the administration's deregulation of industry. That position put him at odds not only with the secretaries of Defense and State but also the president's daughter Ivanka and her husband, Jared Kushner. McGahn doesn't shy away from that kind of fight, his allies say. In a White House filled with loud and warring personalities, McGahn is something quite different, according his supporters. \"Don McGahn has a nickname among some of us who know him: 'The Quiet Man' \u2014 in the sense that he's not seeking glory, he's not seeking attention,\" Leo said. \"He's trying to advise the president in a way where catastrophes are avoided.\" A Democratic defender put it more bluntly, saying McGahn's problem isn't anything he has done. Rather, \"it's his catastrophic client.\" A conservative friend of McGahn's was yet more scathing, declaring that even if the great Justice \"Oliver Wendell Holmes were advising this president, it wouldn't matter.\" If McGahn agrees with any of those assessments, he keeps it to himself. \"I would say he's doing a pretty good job in the circumstances that he's inherited,\" said Boyden Gray, who served as White House counsel for President George H.W. Bush. There are more problems than usual in the Trump administration, Gray notes, because so many White House staff and Cabinet members have little or no experience in government. And the lessons of Watergate often seem lost on today's power players. Former Nixon White House counsel John Dean, who ended up behind bars for his role in Watergate, has a warning for this White House. \"I saw in Watergate,\" he said, \"not only myself but others get across the line out of pure carelessness. And then, once across the line, and realizing the problem, there was a doubling down \u2014 trying to make it work \u2014 which was even more foolish.\"",

            "article_content": "Voters in the Netherlands go to the polls on Wednesday, March 15, for a general election. Much of the attention is on the anti-immigrant populist party led by conservative Geert Wilders.  LAKSHMI SINGH, HOST: I'm Lakshmi Singh. (SOUNDBITE OF PROTEST) UNIDENTIFIED PROTESTERS: (Chanting in foreign language). SINGH: Violent protests broke out in the Dutch port city of Rotterdam overnight as Turks took to the streets. They were protesting a decision by the Dutch government to block two Turkish ministers from visiting the Netherlands. Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan's said Holland was acting like a banana republic. For more on this diplomatic blow-up and its broader global implications, we turn now to NPR's Frank Langfitt who is in Amsterdam. Frank, first, how did relations between these two NATO allies spiral downward so quickly? FRANK LANGFITT, BYLINE: The situation here is this - the Turkish foreign minister was planning to fly here to rally expatriate Turks. There's a significant population of Turkish people here in the Netherlands. And he wants them to vote in a referendum in Turkey next month to give the president there a lot more power. When Turkey's family minister defied the Dutch and drove here to Rotterdam yesterday, the Dutch police surrounded her car, and then they actually escorted her out of the country. SINGH: So what's the response in Turkey? LANGFITT: Well, the president there, of course, is furious. He has called the Dutch government Nazi remnants. He's also blaming the blocking of his ministers actually on Dutch politics. Here's the quote. He says, if you can sacrifice Turkish-Dutch relations for an election on Wednesday, you'll pay a price. SINGH: When Erdogan says this was driven by Dutch elections, what's he talking about? LANGFITT: Well, there's a much bigger political context here. You know, there's a big worry about populism here in the Netherlands, especially after the victory of Donald Trump in the U.S., and also in the U.K., the vote to leave the European Union. The Netherlands goes to the polls next week, and it's going to be pretty closely watched outside of the country. Mark Rutte, he's the prime minister, he's running in a close race with populist Geert Wilders. Some call Geert Wilders sort of the Dutch Trump. He wants to close the Netherlands' borders, shut mosques, ban the Quran. And Wilders is also really anti-Turkey. He made this clear to the Turks in a video back in 2015. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) GEERT WILDERS: Your government is fooling you into believing that one day you will become a member of the European Union. Well, forget it. You are no Europeans, and you will never be. An Islamic state like Turkey does not belong to Europe. All the values Europe stands for - freedom, democracy, human rights - are incompatible with Islam. So Turkey, stay away from us. You are not welcome here. LANGFITT: So some of the Dutch, they think Rutte took a hard line on the Turks on Saturday to kind of outflank Wilders, who's been pushing the political debate here in the country to the right. SINGH: How do voters in the Netherlands feel about Wilders? LANGFITT: Very, very divided. You know, some people see him as looking out for ordinary Dutch. Others say he's completely against the tolerant traditions of the Netherlands. Other people say he gets too much attention, including from the international press, that he's not going to poll that high in these elections coming up. I followed Wilders on the campaign trail yesterday and ran into a counter-protester. Her name's Sanne Elisabeth, and she says Wilders is sort of using the identity politics to pit people against one another. And it reminds her of kind of the things that she saw similar strategies, from her perception, in the U.S. presidential, and, of course, the Brexit campaign last year. SANNE ELISABETH: It's divide and conquer. The same - it's the same. They want white people. They want white privilege, white supremacy to be defended, but it's unreasonable. We are all equal. SINGH: Frank, beyond the Netherlands, how important are this week's elections? LANGFITT: It's going to be really closely watched. And some people will see it, certainly outside the Netherlands, as a third test of the strength of sort of an anti-immigrant populism that we saw driving part of Brexit and certainly part of Trump's win in the United States. If Wilders wins, he's unlikely to be prime minister. Other leading parties say they won't work with him in a coalition government. But if he gets the most votes, it will be a bit of a shot in the arm for populist - other populists in Europe, like Marine Le Pen of the National Front in France.

Attorney General Jeff Sessions will appear before the Senate Judiciary Committee for an oversight hearing Wednesday. There's a lot to discuss. In eight months as the nation's top federal law enforcement official, Sessions has presided over a series of Justice Department reversals \u2014 from police oversight and voting rights litigation to protections for the LGBT community. And then there's the matter of his contacts with Russians during last year's presidential campaign, where Sessions served as one of President Trump's most vocal advocates. Sessions didn't include those on his security clearance forms. An aide said he was following guidance from the FBI. Here's what you need to know. 1. Democrats: Don't duck us All nine Democrats on the Judiciary Committee put Attorney General Sessions on notice with a letter last week. \"We expect that...you will have determined whether the president will invoke executive privilege as to specific topics and will be prepared to answer completely all questions in those areas on which he has not,\" the letter said. Democrats on the panel took that unusual step after Sessions declined to answer a series of queries in June about the Russia probe and other sensitive topics, arguing it was \"inappropriate\" for him to respond because President Trump might choose to invoke executive privilege. The senators now say the time is up for Sessions to delay providing answers. And they said they'll expect him to share a list of issues on which the White House has asserted privilege at the hearing. 2. On Russian contacts: Who, what and when? At his confirmation hearing in January, Sessions went out of his way to deny any contacts with Russians last year, in response to a question from Sen. Al Franken, D-Minn. \"I have been called a surrogate at a time or two in that campaign and I didn't have \u2014 did not have communications with the Russians, and I'm unable to comment on it,\" Sessions said at the time. Later, he denied any such contacts in response to a written question from Sen. Patrick Leahy, D-Vt. Since then, The Washington Post reported Sessions at least twice spoke with then-Russian Ambassador Sergey Kislyak. The disclosures prompted the attorney general to announce his recusal from the ongoing investigation into Russian interference in last year's presidential election. Later, The Post and CNN reported Sessions may have had a third, undisclosed encounter with Kislyak. Those inconsistencies are likely to be a hot topic at the hearing, according to the national security website Just Security. Two more Russia-related questions for Sessions: whether or not he's been interviewed by investigators for special counsel Robert Mueller, who's leading the Justice Department's criminal probe into election interference; and whether President Trump, publicly infuriated by Sessions' recusal, has gotten over his ire. 3. Civil rights reversals This year, the Justice Department reversed course in a pair of closely watched voting rights cases, in Texas and Ohio. Under Sessions, the department revoked guidance designed to protect transgender students in schools. And it filed an amicus brief in a major Supreme Court case backing a bakery owner who refused to make a wedding cake for a same-sex couple because of his religious objections. The Lawyers Committee for Civil Rights Under Law said Sessions \"must be held accountable for the significant changes that have taken place on his watch, which have virtually brought federal civil rights enforcement to a grinding halt.\" 4. Law and order After campaigning on a promise of \"law and order,\" President Trump and his attorney general have backed away from investigating local police departments in search of patterns of discriminatory or unconstitutional behavior. Sessions said discrete acts of criminal activity by state or local police officers could come under DOJ scrutiny, but he said the federal government is a partner to law enforcement, not an overseer. Sessions also directed federal prosecutors to advance \"the most serious, readily provable offense\" in cases, including those involving drug crimes in which the Obama administration had sought to exercise more discretion. He's long opposed efforts in Congress to reduce penalties for federal drug crimes, in contrast to a group of police chiefs, local prosecutors and bipartisan lawmakers appearing in Washington Wednesday. Those officials are sending Sessions and Trump a letter imploring them to change course. \"We do not believe that public safety is served by a return to tactics that are overly punitive without strong purpose,\" said the letter from Law Enforcement Leaders to Reduce Crime and Incarceration. \"From decades of experience on the front lines, we have learned first-hand that these responses are ineffective to reduce crime. We cannot incarcerate our way to safety.\"",

Remember Katie? She is the woman from Delaware who is thinking about getting married, but her boyfriend doesn't want her to take his last name. \"He was strongly against it,\" she wrote. \"He doesn't want an obviously Latino surname (think: Lopez or Garcia) to affect me negatively.\" Well, Katie's question, and our answer last week, drew a lot of responses. We heard from people all over the country who've been in similar situations. Some agreed with us, some didn't. And while no one had a perfect solution, they all gave us a lot to think about. Here are excerpts from some of the best responses: Charla Grenz Solheim, 41, from Portland, Ore., has been in an interracial relationship for 15 years. She says that at the end of the day, it's up to Katie to ask herself some hard questions: Is it worth causing issues or stress for her partner? Probably not. Would it be instructive to her as a social experiment, and does she feel capable to handle whatever issues may arise because of her decision to change her name? Does her partner really NOT want her to change her name, or does he simply want to educate her on the risks involved? My general stance is: What's the real thing you're discussing? Does he just worry in general about disadvantaging you? Are you just trying to simplify your name/life or do you really feel strongly about taking his last name as a show of solidarity or tradition or whatever? In my experience, getting to the root of the thing is more efficient than the surface-level arguments about them. Daniel Ignacio Headley, 41, is from Albuquerque, N.M., and was born in Mexico. He started out life as Ignacio Perches but agreed to have his name changed at age 5, when his Mexican mother married a white American: I had no idea then that this would confuse people for the rest of my life. Now, I am a 41-year-old Latino, 100 percent Mexican origin (whatever that means), naturalized U.S. citizen, native Spanish speaker, married to a blond-haired woman with blue eyes, and we share my English last name. My wife would tell you that she has experienced some awkward, and even painful, situations since marrying me. People often think that, since she has an English last name and she is clearly a white person, she is a safe person to complain with about the presence of Latinos in our country. She is not. We are passionate about the plight of the foreigners among us, including Latinos, and we aren't afraid to lovingly, yet firmly, educate people on the subject. So, in some ways, having an English last name has resulted in my wife hearing more ugly comments, not less. As for how a Latino person with an English name is perceived, I can say that is often weird, too. I can't tell you how many times I've had to explain why my last name is Headley, because at first glance, it is clear that I am not English. As a result, white people and Hispanic people are confused about where I come from. Am I one of them, or not? Am I safe? Am I on their side? This is the problem and why we are having this discussion. One of our suggestions for Katie was that her partner consider taking her last name: \"Then, you would both share a name, and next time he is sending out his r\u00e9sum\u00e9, he might get a taste of that white privilege himself.\" Not so fast, says Catherine Rock, 26, of Dallas. She warns that Katie and her boyfriend should think twice before taking that route: My husband and I decided to take my last name, rather than his, and in Texas at least, it's a much more drawn-out and expensive process to change the man's name. I could have just danced in and out of the courthouse with the marriage license, but my husband has had to file a legal petition, get his fingerprints run and set a court date to go before a judge to get permission to change his. All totaled, we're out about 300 bucks more than we would be if it was my name changing, and we're in the third month of the process. It's frustrating, and more than a bit draconian. I am confident it wouldn't be such an issue if more couples made this choice. So the gender inequality continues. Loren Hadzimuratovic, 32, in Washington, D.C., says she was nine months into a marriage where she took her husband's \"very 'foreign' name.\" The experience has been an eye-opener: Quick background: I am a white woman from North Carolina. My husband, on the other hand, is a Muslim refugee who came here as a teenager fleeing a civil war. He is also tall, blond, with blue-green eyes. His first name is an Arabic name, but easily passes, both in pronunciation and writing, as a name in America that no one thinks twice about. The only place in which my husband does not \"pass\" is his very long, difficult to pronounce, Islamic last name, which is now my last name as well. What I noticed in the conversation with Katie was a lot of the discussion rotating around her possibly losing privilege or not getting what it would be like to have a name that people judge. From my own perspective, the loss of privilege hasn't happened (as much as I can tell), but that has been entirely at my husband's expense: People we interact with work incredibly hard to ensure that I keep my privilege as \"a real American\" by commenting on the sacrifice I've made to take such a weird name. For example: Every single hotel or airport we walk into has included someone looking at our names quickly looking at me to ask if this is my married name and then saying, \"Wow, you must really love him to take THAT name.\" On my own, people really want to know if this is my \"real\" name or just my \"married\" name, and the look of comfort that comes when I answer that it's my married name is beyond disconcerting. They insist on comparing me versus him, upholding my status as \"normal.\" It bothers them that we seem so \"American,\" and yet that name clearly indicates that SOMETHING is amiss, and they truly will not stop until they understand who the foreigner is. Changing my name opened up a new vulnerability for my husband, who has frankly worked so hard to pass and excel in a very white professional world. It's possible that Katie's partner doesn't want to open up yet another avenue of attack, made even more uncomfortable and deeply personal by it being linked to the woman he loves. I'm not saying people shouldn't change their name. But I will readily admit that I saw a name change as only something that impacted me and never occurred to me that society's reaction would work so hard to point out that HE is the different one who caused this, whose foreign-ness I tolerate because of my love for him. And let's give the last word to Cyndi Castle, 27, from Dallas. She is Mexican-American and recently married a white man. Cyndi understands Katie's dilemma \u2014 she grew up proud of her Mexican name, and it's a big part of her heritage. But she also sees things from the viewpoint of Katie's boyfriend: When we first discussed marriage and got engaged, changing my name was a fairly out-of-the-question and difficult topic for me. I'm proud of my heritage. In many ways, my name is one of the only distinguishing factors of my heritage. [But] I knew changing my name was important to my husband, so I slowly considered hyphenating for him. Then election season began to gear up. I changed my mind. A portion of me did decide to change my name out of fear. It's a reality and one I struggle with daily. But another portion did it because I remembered those early years of life \u2014 feeling different and alone. I didn't want to do that to my future children. A portion of me did it because I remember when a group of people I thought were my friends told me I only got into the college I wanted and got a scholarship because I was Latinx. Not because I had straight A's, great test scores or was a National Merit Scholar. And these were supposed to be my friends. I couldn't expose my future children to that devastation and that form of racism which can, and very well seems to be, getting worse. I wanted to spare them the looks in job interviews. The comments, \"You're not what we expected.\" I'm changing my name. It still hurts me to say it. I feel like I'm mourning. I feel like I've lost a part of myself. That I'm going to have to work even harder to show my identity. That I'll just blend in. It's what I wanted, given the situation. But I don't enjoy it. I'll give my children Latinx identities in other ways. I'll encourage them to be proud of their heritage and culture. To enjoy salsa dancing and the music that I grew up with. I'll make sure their grandparents teach them Spanish, and that they'll visit Mexico and see their roots. But they won't have my name. Need your own racial advice?

Kamau Bell performs at Vulture Festival Comedy Night in New York City in 2014. Comic W. Kamau Bell has spent much of his life feeling awkward. A self-described \"tall, rangy black dude,\" Bell was often mistaken for a basketball player growing up \u2014 except that serious asthma and allergies meant he spent the bulk of his childhood indoors watching TV. He says, \"There was this weird sense of guilt about the fact that I wasn't using the physical shell that God had given me, and that I wasn't taking advantage of my physical gifts.\" As an adult, he gravitated towards comedy, but he felt conflicted about the fact that he often didn't fit in in black comedy clubs. \"When white audiences didn't think I was funny, I was like, Well they didn't think I was funny; but when black audiences didn't think I was funny, it hurt my soul,\" Bell says. On his CNN series United Shades of America, now in its second season, Bell celebrates his status as an outsider. It's a travel show in which the comic visits places that make him feel uncomfortable, such as a Ku Klux Klan gathering. Bell's new memoir is The Awkward Thoughts of W. Kamau Bell. On how audiences reacted to him interviewing white nationalist Richard Spencer on United Shades of America The No. 1 pushback that I've gotten on social media is, like, \"Why are you giving him a platform?\" And it was very similar to the pushback I got last year from people with the Klan episode. ... Tales of a 6' 4, African American, Heterosexual, Cisgender, Left-Leaning, Asthmatic, Black and Proud Blerd, Mama's Boy, Dad, and Stand-Up Comedian by W. Kamau Bell Hardcover, 340 pages | Your purchase helps support NPR programming. How? For me, it's like, platforms aren't always positive things. ... I'm afraid of the impact of his ideas, but I think if you put my ideas next to his ideas, which is what we do on the show, ... it's very clear that the America he's envisioning is not the America most of America wants. I think many people still in the wake of Trump's election aren't really ready to embrace the fact that the seed of the base of President Trump is white supremacy. ... We have a false notion that people get changed in one conversation. I always blame it on that movie American History X, where Ed Norton's character hangs out with the black guy in the laundry and over the course of a few clothes-folding sessions they end up going, \"Man, black people are pretty cool!\" I feel like we should know by now that it doesn't happen that quickly. On how racism in the South compares to racism in the North I don't know where the phrase comes from \u2014 it's just one of those things you hear and it feels like a truism to me: That in the North they don't care how high you get as long as you don't get too close; in the South they don't care about how close you get as long as you don't get too high. The idea being that [in the North] you ... could be a black doctor; but in the South they don't want you to be a doctor, but you can live across the street. I really do feel like there is a way in which there's a sense of honesty in the South \u2014 whether they like you or they don't like you \u2014 that is very clear, that I somehow appreciate, that in the North sometimes \u2014 and this is true of the West Coast too \u2014 you're like, \"I don't know if you like me or not. You're being polite, but it doesn't feel that nice.\" So I do feel like the one thing I've learned is that the South \u2014 because of its history of racism, the history of slavery coming from the South \u2014 it's a much better place than most Americans want to give it credit for. On performing in front of mostly white audiences when he was starting out I started doing comedy on the North Side of Chicago, which is the whiter side of town. ... In America we don't say \"white,\" we just sort of say regular. So they're white rooms, but they're not broadcast as that. It's just a coffee shop where mostly white people are at, or a bar where mostly white people hang out. So I find myself in these situations where I go onstage in these white open mics and talk about racism. First of all, I wasn't funny, let's be clear about that. ... So the audience is sort of like, Do I believe his experience? Is this true what he's saying? Is he making this up? So I'm having to fight for the premise, and not fight for the punchline. You have to fight for like, \"Can we all agree that these are the facts of the situation?\" And that's what a premise of a joke is: You have to get the audience to buy into the facts as you're laying them out. Even if the facts are ridiculous, you have to get them to buy in. But if they don't buy into the premise, the punchline doesn't matter. On struggling in black comedy rooms I started stand-up in 1994, so we're talking about the height of Def [Comedy Jam]. ... So black comedy, which had been an underground phenomenon, becomes mainstream on HBO. ... Before that, you've got Richard Pryor and Bill Cosby, who were very different, [who] are both considered to be black comedians, but now there's a thing called \"black comedy.\" So a lot of black comedy rooms open up \u2014 rooms that are catering to black audiences, which is great because those audiences didn't have those rooms before. ... I didn't spend a lot of time in the black comedy clubs, because even walking in there it felt like public school but grown up. It's like, these are the same kids when I was a kid where I felt like I was being made fun of because I wasn't listening to the right music or I wasn't being a black man in the right way. And now they're all adults and they're drinking and they want the show they've seen on HBO. They want the Def Jam show. ... Anytime I would find myself going onstage in these places it was very clear to me and the audience that you're not doing this the way we want it. ... So I got my feelings hurt quite often. ... Worse than bombing in a comedy club, Terry, people don't realize, is actually just doing mediocre. There's something beautiful about bombing. Mediocre is horrible.

Ralph Abernathy (second from left), Ralph Bunche (third from right) and Rabbi Abraham Joshua Heschel (far right) march with him. When Jewish couple Mikey Franklin and Sonya Shpilyuk hung a \"Black Lives Matter\" banner from the window of their condominium, they hoped to voice their solidarity with the social justice movement. Instead, the backlash to their small act of resistance was swift. Two days later, their car was egged and toilet paper was strewn across a tree in front of their property. A handwritten message, carefully spelled out in block letters, admonished Franklin and Shpilyuk for their banner and warned the couple to \"enjoy the mayhem.\" At the bottom of the letter was a yellow Star of David and the word \"Jude,\" German for Jew. With hate crimes on the rise, old coalitions between blacks and Jews are being rekindled and tested. According to a recent survey by the Institute for Social Policy and Understanding (ISPU), 57 percent of Jews support Black Lives Matter, the second highest percentage of any faith group following Muslims. Although blacks and Jews worked closely to advance social justice during the Civil Rights Movement, the strong ties between the two groups have waned since the end of Jim Crow. But the election of President Trump has contributed to a marked increase in hate crimes, while racist and anti-Semitic attacks had already been on the rise for years. The FBI's 2015 Hate Crimes Statistics report showed that most hate crimes are racially motivated, with over half targeting African-Americans. Religiously motivated attacks rose nearly 23 percent compared to 2014, with the majority targeting Jews. Since January 2017, anti-Semitic hate crimes in New York have risen by 94 percent when compared to the same period in 2016. In March, army veteran and white supremacist James Jackson was indicted on terrorism charges after traveling to New York City to allegedly kill black men. During the 1950s, the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) and Anti-Defamation League (ADFL) began to work as a united front on issues from segregation to employment discrimination. In 1965, at the height of the Civil Rights Era, Rabbi Abraham Joshua Heschel marched side by side with Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. from Selma to Birmingham. The image of the two faith leaders has been a longtime emblem of black-Jewish alliance. The story of Michael Schwerner and Andrew Goodman, two Jewish civil rights activists who were murdered in Mississippi along with James Chaney, a black activist, in 1964, is similarly notable. Their murder was the basis of the acclaimed 1988 Academy Award-winning film Mississippi Burning. But not all Jews view this golden age of black-Jewish relations as old allies reconnecting. Ma'Nishtana, a Brooklyn-based African-American Orthodox Jewish author and educator, believes this common narrative is a \"romanticized and inflated revisionist history of how involved the Jewish community was during the civil rights era.\" Cheryl Greenberg, a history professor at Trinity College, also holds the view that Jewish support for civil rights wasn't entirely noble. \"The meeting of the minds regarding the civil rights agenda emerged from a clear, explicit self-interest. Jews realized that their self-interest rested in making sure that the United States didn't discriminate against anybody. History showed them that if anybody went first, Jews were sure to come next.\" The closeness of the black and Jewish groups was not only a product of common moral and ideological beliefs, but also a function of proximity. Today, the term \"ghetto\" is used to refer to a poor, urban black community, but at the turn of the 20th century, ghettos in places like Harlem and the Bronx were also home to immigrant groups and American Jews. As Jews became more upwardly mobile, Greenberg said, \"they benefitted from white privilege even though they didn't know it, and failed to recognize the structural barriers preventing black people from doing better economically. They began to push a kind of race-blind approach to society.\" The growing divide between the two communities was crystallized in Regents of the University of California v. Bakke, a controversial affirmative action case that marked the first time black and Jewish groups filed amicus briefs on opposite sides of the same question. Divisions between the two groups became further entrenched as black activists embraced an anti-imperialist message and American Jews embraced loyalty to Israel, according to Marjorie Feld, a history professor at Babson College. \"After 1967, when Israel began its occupation of the West Bank and Gaza, the Third World Movement began to focus too on Palestinians, and so too did some black Americans,\" she said. Today, Israel continues to be a flashpoint of conflict between blacks and Jews. In August 2016, the Movement for Black Lives, a national umbrella organization encompassing over 50 organizations, released a policy platform titled \"A Vision for Black Lives.\" The document, which touches on issues including criminal justice and education reform, also includes a statement on Israel and Palestine: \"The US justifies and advances the global war on terror via its alliance with Israel and is complicit in the genocide taking place against the Palestinian people... Israel is an apartheid state with over 50 laws on the books that sanction discrimination against the Palestinian people.\" Although this position occupies only a bullet point in a brief section of the document, its inclusion has been the source of significant backlash from conservative and progressive Jewish groups alike. T'ruah, a coalition of rabbis that advocates for human rights, published a statement saying it agreed with many of the policy recommendations of the document, but objected to the characterization of the Israeli occupation as genocide. The Jewish Community Relations Council of Boston (JCRC) took it a step further by dissociating itself completely from Black Lives Matter by claiming \"JCRC cannot and will not align ourselves with organizations that maliciously assert Israel is committing genocide.\" Despite these fissures in black-Jewish relations, according to Marjorie Feld, a history professor at Babson College, a generational gap is now emerging within the Jewish community on questions of Israel and Black Lives Matter. \"It is older American Jews, some say, who won't let go of their unquestioning Zionism, while younger Jews are far more critical of Israel.\" Feld's remarks reflect wider trends among American youth today. A recent Pew Research study found that millennials are the only generational cohort in which fewer than half sympathize with Israel. Over a quarter of millennials sympathize with Palestinians \u2014 the highest of any generation. \"Social change requires discomfort. Sometimes it requires us to work with people we will not agree with on every issue,\" said Carin Mrotz, Executive Director of Jewish Community Action (JCA). \"When Jewish organizations quickly issued statements of intent to pull away from work with Black Lives Matter, the cynical part of my brain questioned how deep or authentic those relationships really were.\" As a social justice organization, JCA has a strong focus on solidarity work and collaborates with groups including Black Lives Matter Minneapolis on initiatives from stopping private prisons to increasing affordable housing access. While young progressive white Jews like Mrotz have taken a stand in Jewish communities to deepen their commitment to racial justice, Jews of color have played an instrumental role in bringing together the black and Jewish communities in the face of the Black Lives Matter controversy. Jews for Racial and Economic Justice (JREJ), a New York City-based advocacy group, has helped organize Jews throughout the city, most of whom identify as white, to engage them in action for racial justice. Leo Ferguson, a community organizer at JREJ, voices frustration at the peripheral involvement of most Jewish institutions in today's fight for racial justice. \"As a Black person, I don't have the luxury of walking away from this reality, or of abandoning my Black siblings when they need me to fight alongside them for justice and freedom from fear,\" he said. \"That commitment to our movement \u2014 to Jews of Color and Black people everywhere \u2014 is what I need from my entire Jewish community, not only when it is easy, but when it is hard.\" Ferguson founded JREJ's Jews of Color Caucus, which developed a relationship with Black Lives Matter NYC in fall 2016. Recently, the two groups collaborated to plan a vigil and march for Ramarley Graham, an unarmed black teenager who was fatally shot in late March. Yavilah McCoy, a black and Jewish teacher and activist, believes heightened visibility of black American Jews will help make black issues Jewish issues. \"The more we incorporate the concerns of Jews of color in what 'the Jewish community' cares about, the faster we can create a paradigm shift that moves the idea of Jewish identity beyond just white identity,\" she said. \"The further we get towards understanding that, the closer we are to comprehending what does racial justice and equity need to look like as an internal issue to the Jewish community.\" Akinyi Ochieng is a writer and researcher studying at the London School of Economics.

I'm a black woman of a certain age, a divorced mom of two teenagers who has no choice but to focus daily on the challenges of keeping a home, my family and myself on track. I'm college educated, work in media communications, am precariously middle class \u2014 and I am tired of what I witness of today's feminism. I'd hoped that the Women's March might help me update my perception of feminism, at least as it is commonly portrayed and disseminated of late. I'd followed the back and forth in the alternative and mainstream press during its hurried, urgent formation, and chalked up reports about internal squabbles over the race and class makeup of the group's leadership to the same kind of growing pains that beset every activist group that I've ever followed or covered during my years in newsrooms. But now, a month after the Women's March masterfully pulled off a massive protest in D.C. that also inspired similar ones in major American and global cities, my nascent investigation of the March 8 \"general strike\" and \"Day Without Women\" raised only more concerns, and a few questions, all located in what I see as a big void in today's marketing-driven expression of \"feminism.\" At this moment, whether expressed by the second-wave, Gloria Steinem wing, or the third-wave corporatist Sheryl Sandberg arm, or the rowdy, genitalia-obsessed Lena Dunham arm, it seems that \"feminism\" in 2017 is more concerned with promoting superficial trappings of genuine equality than with doing the tough work required to address the hard, cold facts of gender and racial inequality. For example, across all U.S. occupations, women's median weekly earnings are $706 per week, compared with $860 for men, and the top 30 occupations for women cover a range of essential \u2014 but relatively low-paying \u2014 jobs such as elementary school teachers, administrative assistants, customer service representatives and retail sales, according to the most recent data available (2013) from the United States Bureau of Labor Statistics Women's Bureau. And, while black and Latina women together make up nearly 18 million of the total number of America's 67 million working women, they are disproportionately more likely to be heads of households, yet also more likely to receive less pay than white women and white men. Moreover, in addition to stubborn disparities in the workforce and incomes, women of color see huge gaps between themselves and white men and women in health outcomes and other key life-expectancy indicators. The Women's March, while apparently \"led\" by a diverse collection of black, white, Latina and Asian women from across age groups, is the latest entry in a recent bumper crop of \"feminist movements,\" \"collectives,\" \"initiatives\" that claim inclusivity and egalitarian principles, but which somehow always seem tone-deaf, at best, to the daily, on-the-ground realities of nonfamous black women and Latinas. How, then, will working-class black women and Latinas respond to the idea of missing a day of work in a general strike as part of political resistance? It is a case of high-minded ideology that, while well-meaning, doesn't take into account the fact that some women can't miss even a single day of work without fear of being fired or docked a full day's pay. Consider that the \"Day Without Immigrants,\" on Feb. 16 \u2014 organized by disparate workers' and immigrant rights organizations in response to President Trump's proposal to build a wall between the U.S. and Mexico, and to impose a strict immigration ban on seven Middle Eastern nations \u2014 resulted in private companies in several cities firing dozens of workers who participated in the boycott. While the symbolism of the \"Day Without Immigrants\" is certainly valuable, for the immigrant and women workers who got fired for participating, and who now must find new jobs, you have to wonder if they now genuinely believe they received appropriate return on their investment. I have similar concerns about the upcoming \"Day Without Women.\" As Jessa Crispin noted in a recent essay, \"the pro-woman power elite peers deeply into the savage inequalities of American life and asks, 'Where's my half of the profits?' \" Akin to the debate over white privilege, the debate over feminism is similarly stuck in a binary construct, largely defined in middle- or upper-middle-class white-lady contexts. Variations exist along generational lines: See the Lena Dunham crowd contrasted against the Steinem wing. But the marketing of modern feminism, and the oxygen-sucking place it holds in the public imagination, is largely occupied by white women. The occasional invocation of Audre Lorde, Fannie Lou Hamer or Angela Davis by some leaders within these status quo or emerging white feminist camps in 2017 is notable \u2014 if also to me superficial and insufficient. (Yes, I know Davis is among a group of women who are advocating for a general strike.) Today's purveyors of hashtag feminism exemplified by pink \"pussy hats,\" safety pins and cheeky-ballsy slogans on T-shirts have forgotten that women of color have to learn how to navigate their own universes but also those of white women and men to literally be able to pay the rent and afford decent schools. We have to succeed in both spheres not only to achieve success, but to fundamentally cope. To ask us, then, to participate in a Lysistrata-like action makes me wonder if the gesture is designed more to give white ladies another opportunity for displaying unity, a kind of safari solidarity, than it is to provide women of color and working-class women tangible relief. However out of fashion it is to say so in the wake of the 2016 presidential election, identity politics are inherently personal. Identity politics do, in fact, drive political outcomes, which in turn drive policy, economic and social developments. I don't now and never have viewed the conventional version of feminism as a defining part of my identity; rather, based on what I have experienced and learned from the black women I've known my entire life, I have absorbed a degree of resilience, appreciation for common sense, and unflashy problem-solving that many women of color demonstrate. It is no accident that Black Lives Matter was co-founded by Alicia Garza, Opal Tometi and Patrisse Cullors in the wake of the death of 18-year-old Michael Brown in Ferguson, Mo. Within the span of two years, BLM expanded into an effort to organize the energies and intellect of people of color and whites toward strategically resisting police brutality and other American institutions where systemic race and gender discrimination put us at risk. The energy and determination of BLM, its ability to spur dozens of protests nationwide since 2014, garnering condemnations from some police unions and elected politicians, seems to have inspired organizers of the Women's March without, apparently, deeply informing the group about the full range of potential negative consequences for participants. Telling also is the group's tepid nod to intersectionality, the concept coined by Kimberl\u00e9 Williams Crenshaw, a black legal scholar, which has informed the positions and actions of many emerging protest movements in recent years. Crenshaw's concept of intersectionality \u2014 the critical analysis of gender, ethnic and class aspects that drive inequality in populations and social structures \u2014 was earlier identified as \"interlocking\" factors by Chicana playwright Cherr\u00ede Moraga. This intellectual trait, the ability to recognize the multidimensional layers of inequality, are bedrocks of effective leadership across disciplines \u2014 although when demonstrated by women of color they are rarely characterized as such by the dominant society. Today's iteration of feminism might gain wider credibility by recognizing and adopting core aspects of women of color's experiences: resilience, self-love and fundamental understanding that one's self-worth is not defined by the same markers of success that have defined white male status since the beginning of time in America.

Bob Corker, R-Tenn. (center), talks to reporters on Capitol Hill. He decided Tuesday not to seek a third term. Corker is the first Senate retirement of the 2018 election cycle. Sen. Bob Corker of Tennessee, chairman of the influential Foreign Relations Committee, will not seek re-election in 2018. He is the first senator to announce retirement plans ahead of next year's election cycle. \"I also believe the most important public service I have to offer our country could well occur over the next 15 months,\" Corker said in a statement, \"and I want to be able to do that as thoughtfully and independently as I did the first 10 years and nine months of my Senate career.\" That could well be an allusion that Corker may speak out more in areas where he may disagree with President Trump. Corker also hinted that his political career may not be over. \"I know that we will continue to have an impact for the remainder of our term,\" Corker said, \"and I look forward to finding other ways to make a difference in the future.\" Corker, 65, the former mayor of Chattanooga, Tenn., has been a steadfast conservative in his votes but moderate in his tone, from making a mark on the auto bailout to playing a key role in the consideration of authorization of force in Syria during the Obama administration. He embraced Trump during the campaign and was even said to be in the running for secretary of state before the job instead went to former Exxon Mobil CEO Rex Tillerson. But Corker's relationship with the president has soured somewhat. In May, he referred to the administration as being in a \"downward spiral\" that Trump needed to get \"under control.\" He also said in August he believed the president \"has not yet been able to demonstrate the stability, nor some of the competence that he needs to demonstrate in order to be successful.\" Former White House chief strategist Steve Bannon had threatened to field a primary opponent to Corker. Even before Corker's comments, polls showed that many conservative voters were unhappy with him. And since then, their attacks on the senator have intensified. His departure opens the door for other GOP candidates. One Republican considering running is Mark Green, a doctor and state lawmaker. Earlier this year, Green was Trump's pick to be Army secretary but withdrew from consideration after being criticized by LGBT and Muslim rights organizations. Here's his full statement: \"After much thought, consideration and family discussion over the past year, Elizabeth and I have decided that I will leave the United States Senate when my term expires at the end of 2018. \"When I ran for the Senate in 2006, I told people that I couldn't imagine serving for more than two terms. Understandably, as we have gained influence, that decision has become more difficult. But I have always been drawn to the citizen legislator model, and while I realize it is not for everyone, I believe with the kind of service I provide, it is the right one for me. \"I also believe the most important public service I have to offer our country could well occur over the next 15 months, and I want to be able to do that as thoughtfully and independently as I did the first 10 years and nine months of my Senate career. \"Serving the people of Tennessee in this capacity has been the greatest privilege of my life. And as I spent the month of August traveling across our great state, I was reminded that we live in a unique place full of people who care deeply about the direction of our country. \"I am grateful to the people of Tennessee for the opportunity to serve my state and country. I have been fortunate to do so with an extraordinary staff, and I want to thank them for their incredible dedication. I know that we will continue to have an impact for the remainder of our term, and I look forward to finding other ways to make a difference in the future. \"Finally, I want to thank my wife, Elizabeth, and our family, who have made many sacrifices in allowing me to serve. Nothing I have done would have been possible without their love and support.\" Chas Sisk is a reporter for NPR member station WPLN in Nashville, Tenn.",

Staff for Colorado Gov. John Hickenlooper, a Democrat, and Ohio Gov. John Kasich, a Republican, are working on a joint plan to stabilize the country's health insurance markets. Kasich told Colorado Public Radio's Colorado Matters that they expect to release it ahead of September hearings in the U.S. Senate. They also intend to get other governors from both parties to sign onto the plan, to show support at the state level. \"We're getting very close. I just talked to my guys today, men and women who are working on this with [Hickenlooper's] people, and we think we'll have some specifics here, I actually think we could have it within a week,\" Kasich said in a joint interview with Hickenlooper that aired Tuesday. The plan will flesh out a set of principles the two men wrote about in an op-ed in The Washington Post, in which they said another one-party health care plan is \"doomed to fail,\" just like the Republican plans considered this year. In the op-ed, they asserted that the best place to start reform efforts is \"to restore stability to our nation's health insurance system.\" Bipartisan health care hearings, including the one the governors will appear at, are set to begin just after Labor Day when Congress returns from its August recess. Lawmakers will be consumed with a number of deadlines involving government funding, though \u2014 sending health care to the back burner. \"I'm not going to get into specifics with you until we have it all ironed out, but it's not going to be some pie-in-the-sky, way-up-there kind of stuff. There will be things that we will address that will have specific solutions. And one of the things we're finding out is the states do have some power to do some things unique to them, as long as these insurance markets are going to be stabilized,\" Kasich said. One specific they agree on and would discuss: changing the Affordable Care Act mandate that employers with 50 or more employees provide insurance coverage. The governors say that number is too low, which deters hiring at small companies. They also agree that the possibility of national single-payer coverage is not on the table in their discussions. In recent months, Hickenlooper and Kasich have appeared on national television shows to advocate for bipartisan health care reform that includes keeping the Medicaid expansion intact, with both took advantage of in their states. The two governors have even entertained running for the White House on a split ticket. On whether they think health care should be a \"right\" John Hickenlooper: I come from the school that I think it is a right. I'm not sure how much health care is included in that right, but some basic coverage. John Kasich: I don't think that's that important in this. I mean we want everybody to have health insurance. I mean that's how I feel. Is it a right or is it a privilege or whatever? I don't know why that declaration is important ... The question is how do you do it, and that's what we're working on ... Primary care is important. Catastrophic coverage is important. We don't want anybody to get bankrupted because they get sick. On what to change about the Affordable Care Act first Hickenlooper: There are several important things, but the probably top one on our list would be this notion of having some sort of reinsurance [using public money to help insure the sickest people] to make sure the high-cost pool is not causing higher rates for all the people seeking insurance on the private markets ... You use reinsurance in almost every type of insurance program to cut off those \"hilltops\" as we say. On why this joint effort may gain traction Hickenlooper: \"[The Senate's health committee] is now holding hearings [starting Sept. 5], and hopefully in those hearings we'll get a chance to present, hopefully, what by that point a number of both Republican and Democratic governors think look like good ideas.\" The Colorado Matters website has the full transcript.

            "article_content": "It's not just staffers in the Trump White House who seem to hate each other. There's a rich tradition of White House rivalry and backstabbing throughout American history.  LULU GARCIA-NAVARRO, HOST: President Trump has left on a working vacation, but his new chief of staff still has a lot on his plate. It's now John Kelly's job to impose discipline. The retired four-star general has to contend with leaks, competing factions and personal rivalries that have run rampant since Inauguration Day. But how unique is all this White House drama? (SOUNDBITE OF 1ST MICHIGAN COLONIAL FIFE AND DRUM CORPS'S \"WASHINGTON'S ARTILLERY MARCH MEDLEY\") GARCIA-NAVARRO: That's the kind of question we referred to professor Ron. You know him as NPR's senior editor and correspondent on the Washington desk, Ron Elving. RON ELVING, BYLINE: There have been palace intrigues for at least as long as there have been palaces. But for our purposes, let's just go back as far as George Washington. He had some exceptionally talented people vying for his favor and attention. And he could barely contain their competing ambitions. His first cabinet was not only an All-Star team. It was an all-Founding-Fathers team, John Adams, Thomas Jefferson, Alexander Hamilton. (APPLAUSE) ELVING: They had different ideas - radically different ideas - about the nature of the federal government itself and different ideas about who should be in charge after Washington retired. (SOUNDBITE OF PLAY, \"HAMILTON\") UNIDENTIFIED ACTORS: (As characters) The election of 1800. ELVING: Jefferson and Adams ran against each other in a bitter presidential campaign. (SOUNDBITE OF PLAY, \"HAMILTON\") UNIDENTIFIED ACTOR #1: (As character, singing) I don't like Adams. UNIDENTIFIED ACTRESS #1: (As character, singing) Well, he's going to lose. That's just defeatist. UNIDENTIFIED ACTOR #2: (As character, singing) And Jefferson... UNIDENTIFIED ACTOR #3: (As character, singing) In love with France. UNIDENTIFIED ACTRESS #2: (As character, singing) Yeah, he's so elitist. ELVING: And Hamilton's conflicts are the stuff of legend. Hamilton wrote a 54-page letter excoriating Adams, accusing him of extreme egoism, distempered jealousy, vanity without bounds, ungovernable indiscretion and ungovernable temper. And Hamilton could be equally unsparing about Jefferson, calling him a man of profound ambition and violent passions with a viewpoint that was unsound and dangerous. LIN-MANUEL MIRANDA: (As Hamilton, rapping) Thomas, that was a real nice declaration. Welcome to the real present. We're running a real nation. Would you like to join us or stay mellow, doing whatever the hell it is you do in Monticello? ELVING: Abraham Lincoln's cabinet was also rife with competition. The historian Doris Kearns Goodwin brought that period to life in her bestseller \"Team Of Rivals,\" which became source material for Steven Spielberg's movie \"Lincoln.\" (SOUNDBITE OF FILM, \"LINCOLN\") DANIEL DAY-LEWIS: (As Abraham Lincoln) There is one Ethan Allen story that I'm very partial to. BRUCE MCGILL: (As Edwin Stanton) No. You're going to tell a story. I don't believe that I can bear to listen to another one of your stories right now. ELVING: In the book and in the movie, Secretary of State William Seward and Secretary of War Edwin Stanton are among the cabinet members holding the president in contempt as the war begins. But over the next four years, they contend with each other and with other cabinet members and come to appreciate Lincoln's unique abilities. (SOUNDBITE OF FILM, \"LINCOLN\") DAY-LEWIS: (As Abraham Lincoln) Fervently do we pray that this mighty scourge of war may speedily pass away. ELVING: In more recent years, we have seen presidents' immediate staff, particularly the chief of staff, take a leading role in White House drama. Think back to the Nixon White House, for example. His powerful chief of staff, H.R. Haldeman, governed access to the Oval Office and ruled the White House with cold precision. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) UNIDENTIFIED MAN #1: H.R. Bob Haldeman was more than just the president's SOB. He was Richard Nixon's stout right arm, his protector, his chief of staff. ELVING: But as the Watergate scandal spread from the campaign operation to the White House itself, Haldeman was unable to control the competing interests of all the president's men. He and his ally John Ehrlichman were forced out in April 1973. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) RICHARD NIXON: In one of the most difficult decisions of my presidency, I accepted the resignations of two of my closest associates in the White House, Bob Haldeman, John Ehrlichman - two of the finest public servants it has been my privilege to know. ELVING: Then Army General Alexander Haig took over as chief of staff. Over the next year, as multiple investigations consumed Nixon himself, Haig became, in many respects, the de facto president. He tried to do it again, in a sense, in 1981. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) UNIDENTIFIED REPORTER #1: When shots were fired at President Reagan. Here you see the president coming out now. ELVING: He was President Ronald Reagan's first secretary of state at the time. And he was present in the White House the day Reagan was shot. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) UNIDENTIFIED REPORTER #2: The assault on the president - who's in charge? ELVING: With Reagan on a hospital operating table and the vice president far from Washington, Haig assumed he was next in line. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) ALEXANDER HAIG: As of now, I am in control here in the White House, pending return of the vice president. And I'm in close touch with him. ELVING: Haig was mistaken, as it turns out a change to the Constitution years earlier had made the speaker of the House the next in line to the Oval Office. Haig would resign as secretary of state the following year. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) UNIDENTIFIED MAN #2: It came like a bolt out of the blue, even though he has had many well-publicized differences with different members of the Reagan administration. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) HAIG: Under these circumstances, I feel it necessary to request that you accept my resignation. ELVING: Which brings us back to President Trump, who has had an unusually tumultuous time in the White House with numerous firings, departures at the most visible level of his staff. And he is dealing with a new reality, the ever-present scrutiny of 24/7 cable TV coverage and social media. In the past, White House intrigues rarely came to light in real time. And we can only imagine how Alexander Hamilton might've used Twitter. Ron Elving, NPR News, Washington. Copyright \u00a9 2017 NPR.  All rights reserved.

One year ago, Barack Obama was winding down his final term and Donald Trump was ... a candidate for president? Muhammad Ali, Juan Gabriel and Philando Castile were still standing, and Standing Rock, N.D., wasn't on most people's maps. The term \"alt-right\" required an explanation; the phrase \"hot sauce in my bag\" did not. And the Code Switch podcast was born. Over the past year, our discussions about race have been shaped by pop culture and fine art; academia and activism; tragedy and humor and politics and food. And we've been shaped by you, our audience \u2014 the questions and ideas that you bring to us every day. So for our anniversary, everyone on the team wrote about some of the stories and ideas that changed how they thought about race. For Shereen Marisol Meraji, it was the idea of an \"explanatory comma\" \u2014 the brief explanation that follows concepts that might be unfamiliar to listeners and readers. (Eg.: Tupac Shakur, a popular African-American rap musician from the early 1990s.) This concept resonated with Shereen because, as a young woman of color, she was often asked to explain herself, but didn't get much in return: \"This could be hyperbole, but it felt like everyone in my very first pitch meeting at NPR got their ideas from a magazine I had never heard of called The New Yorker. I was in my mid-20s, had finally finished my B.A. in Raza Studies from San Francisco State University. (It took forever because I worked full time and went to school.) I'll never forget one of my NPR co-workers saying in a meeting, 'Do all your ideas come from Latino dot net?,' which everyone thought was HILARIOUS. Except me. \"My first few years at that job, I went home and cried a lot. I was like, 'I have no idea what these people are talking about and they have no idea what I'm talking about.' The things I observed in my world, the books I read, the music I loved \u2014 after sitting in those meetings \u2014 they all seemed insignificant. And, maybe it's not true, but it certainly felt like my co-workers were consuming all the same stuff: The New Yorker, The Washington Post, The White Stripes and anything written by David Foster Wallace. \"I started reading The New Yorker and The Post; I'm a huge fan of the White Stripes and I'm grateful to have opened up my world. But, I did it without ever getting an explanatory comma, and I was expected to give one every time I pitched something that didn't come directly from the erudite 'NPR canon' of 'Things One Must Know.' I'm all for 'explanatory commas' \u2013 but they should go both ways.\" For Adrian Florido, it was a story he'd seen covered a lot in the news, but somehow still felt lacking: Jeanette Vizguerra, 45, took sanctuary at the First Baptist Church on May 5, 2017, in Denver.\n                \n                    \n                    John Moore/Getty Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption Jeanette Vizguerra, 45, took sanctuary at the First Baptist Church on May 5, 2017, in Denver. \"When I spoke with Jeanette Vizguerra in April, she had become one of the most prominent faces in the new sanctuary church movement. Churches and other houses of worship had been allowing immigrants without legal status to move into their buildings to protect them from deportation; Vizguerra moved into a Denver church in February. \"Her story had gotten a lot of attention. Yet much of the coverage seemed to treat her as a secondary actor to the role that the church was playing in protecting her. So I called her up. \"It turned out Vizguerra was struggling with her own arrangement. She appreciated the help she was getting from the church, while struggling to assert control over how they used her story to make a broader political statement. \"Nonetheless, from the church's basement, Vizguerra was running the show by helping to advise churches across the country as they figured out how to offer sanctuary to immigrants who needed it. \"Vizguerra upended the way I thought about the sanctuary movement. It's about the work churches do to protect immigrants, yes, but it's just as much about the people they're taking in and the decisions those people are making about their own lives. In late May, Vizguerra emerged from the church to applause and tears of joy. But her case is far from resolved. When I visited her in Denver earlier this month, she spoke of some of the lingering questions that hang over her life like a cloud.\" Kat Chow reflected on a story that hit home for her \u2014 the period last summer, when, separated by less than a day, two black men, Alton Sterling and Philando Castile, were killed by police officers. In response, a group of Asian-American activists co-wrote a letter urging their family members to stand in solidarity with Black Lives Matter: \"As a kid, I'd hear relatives say things about other racial groups like, \"If they just worked harder, like we did...\" or \"We came here with nothing...\" Watching these people write to their families about why they should empathize and support Black Lives Matter felt specific to the Asian-American and immigrant experience. They were, in effect, trying to teach a racial history to their parents, aunts, uncles, grandmothers, grandfathers \u2014 who themselves have their own specific places in the U.S.'s spotty relationship with race. Around the time we talked, Tien Dang, who lives in New York, had never really talked to her father about race, or policing \u2014 or, even, the many black men fatally shot by police officers. Many things separated her father Nam and her, including their language and upbringings: He fled Communist Vietnam after he was sentenced to work in a re-education camp for seven years; she left Vietnam as a young child, grew up in a Dallas suburb and joined a black sorority in college. But this letter \u2014 translated into Vietnamese \u2014 helped start a conversation. Tien and her dad began to talk, tentatively. Small steps. Now, a year later, Tien tells us that she and her dad are talking more: about last year's presidential election, about the news. Tien says her dad sends her emails \u2014 often news about the U.S. in Vietnamese. Tien says they've helped her get a better sense of her father's perspective. \"I had to check myself and my privilege of 'OK, just because my dad doesn't speak English doesn't mean he doesn't know what's going on,' \" she told me recently. \"And I wish that more parents and kids of immigrants were able to have these kinds of conversations.\" Karen Grigsby Bates looked back at a promising young black director and his meteoric rise and fall from grace: Nate Parker attends the The Birth Of A Nation premiere during the 2016 Sundance Film Festival.\n                \n                    \n                    Nicholas Hunt/Getty Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption Nate Parker attends the The Birth Of A Nation premiere during the 2016 Sundance Film Festival. \"The Nate Parker story was a riveting mix of sex, race and hubris. (Lecturing black folks on How To Be Black is just asking for trouble, IMHO, and Parker did a fair amount of that.) And I couldn't help wondering, as I watched Moonlight's Barry Jenkins accept the Oscar for Best Picture, what Parker must be feeling. If he had handled things differently, could he have been a contender? But let's go back to the beginning. An actor for several years, Parker took a hiatus to make his passion project, a story about Nat Turner's rebellion called The Birth of a Nation. When Parker's film debuted at Sundance, it received a standing ovation. Fox Searchlight paid over $17 million to acquire it\u2014 the highest price for a film since Sundance began. There was lots of talk about multiple Oscar nominations. Then, two months before the film was scheduled for release, an old story resurfaced. As an undergraduate at Penn State, Nate Parker had been accused (and later acquitted) of rape by a classmate. With Parker's increased visibility, the old charge resurfaced\u2014with a shocking new bit of knowledge: The woman who'd accused Parker committed suicide in 2012. Parker made the media rounds, trying to explain that while this was an unfortunate situation, he wasn't at fault: \"I've been proven innocent\" he told ABC's Robin Roberts. (Note: acquitted and innocent are different things. One is a legal term, the other is an opinion.) He did not intend to apologize. Our podcast panel debated whether to support Parker's film. The media appearances designed to put Parker's problem behind him failed. Birth opened to respectable numbers, but not the epic ones Fox Searchlight had envisioned. Since then, Parker has largely disappeared.\" Gene Demby reminisced about a movie that felt like its script had been ripped from his diary: Alex R. Hibbert plays Chiron, a young black man growing up gay in an impoverished part of Miami in Moonlight.\n                \n                    \n                    David Bornfriend/A24\n                    \n                \nhide caption Alex R. Hibbert plays Chiron, a young black man growing up gay in an impoverished part of Miami in Moonlight. \"Moonlight is somehow only Barry Jenkins' second feature film. And like his first, Medicine for Melancholy, it's a movie about young black people in a big city trying to find some narrow corners in their worlds in which they can be vulnerable. It's more concerned with things people don't say to each other than what they do. (You gotta wonder if Jenkins' scripts are just pages full of intense ellipses.) Like Medicine, Moonlight felt so familiar in both its small details and big themes that it was personally unnerving; I almost didn't want other people to see it. I didn't want any bits of it \u2014 any of me \u2014 held up for appraisal. \"Which is sorta what Jenkins and I talked about when he dropped by the studio, around the time Moonlight starting getting serious critical buzz, but long before it won the Best Picture Oscar that was nearly given to the wrong film. I mostly wanted to know how Moonlight felt to make, since much of it was plucked directly from the lives of both Jenkins and Tarell Alvin McRaney, who wrote the play on which the movie is based. (In real life, both men grew up in the same Miami housing project as Chiron, the main character, and like Chiron, each was raised by a mother who battled a crack addiction.) \"As we were wrapping up our interview, Jenkins said that his mother hadn't seen the movie yet, but he wanted to rent a theater where she could watch it by herself, and she was slowly coming around to the idea. 'And I think part of that, is ... [a] thawing [of] this distance she wants to put between herself and the movie and the character. You know, what she said to me was, Yeah, you know, I was out there \u2014 I did those things.' And finally, a word from Walter Ray Watson about what it's been like to produce a podcast about race (by himself, for the first six months!) in a year that's had no shortage of race stories: From what makes a good immigrant, to who gets to make fun of an accent, to what it was like for Audie Cornish to be bused to school in a Boston suburb: \"There we were, just a year ago, trying to conceive of a podcast on race that had gone to territory covered before. We did tryouts with members of the Code Switch team. I sat in on all the studio sessions an edited countless hours of them. Different formats and combinations of players. We talked about finding the right voices to discuss hard truths and explore answers that weren't simply black and white. \"We found ways that kept us rooted in journalism, not just sounding off about painful and disturbing situations. But self-reporting and empathy belonged on this podcast. It's been an ongoing exercise to find the right tone for every episode before we publish. \"And getting there is never 'one size fits all.' \"We've asked: What must it feel like to know safe spaces like the Pulse nightclub as a queer person of color, and think about how that experience forever changed after the deaths of so many in Orlando? How about the real and current fears of Muslims who are regarded as 'other'? Or anyone who's tired of being asked, 'Where are you from, really?' \"Do we understand or accept the ways race played out before, during and after Obama any better now from our episodes on that legacy? Is it possible to talk about race and identity without blame, shame or partisanship? What do you think? (And the question isn't rhetorical.) \"As journalists, we kept mining these discussions that often get set aside because they're too messy, too squishy, too emotional. Recognizing and documenting voices that speak to a changing America remains important. And finding new ways to get at that tension is what we keep looking for.\"",

Jeff Sessions did exactly what he needed to do Tuesday \u2014 help himself in the eyes of his boss, President Trump, and, in turn, help Trump. The attorney general, an early Trump supporter, revealed little in the congressional hearing about the ongoing Russia saga or Trump's role in possibly trying to quash the investigation looking into it. Using vague legal justification, Sessions shut down potentially important lines of investigative questioning \u2014 and that may be exactly how the White House wants it. Sessions showed flashes of anger rarely seen from the 70-year-old Alabamian, calling any suggestion that he colluded with Russia to interfere in the U.S. presidential election a \"detestable lie.\" The tactic \u2014 combined with the earlier testimony of high-ranking Trump administration officials, who also deemed it inappropriate to divulge conversations with the president \u2014 may have created a road map for the White House to keep its secrets without the public relations blowback of invoking executive privilege. Sessions wanted this open hearing before the Senate Intelligence Committee so he could respond to fired FBI Director James Comey. Comey \u2014 a man whom, it was revealed Tuesday, Sessions wanted gone before Day 1 \u2014 intimated in testimony last week that Sessions' potential conflicts went deeper than were originally known. Sessions denied all of it and shielded his boss from any potential damage. Silence is golden? It became obvious from the get-go Tuesday that Sessions would not disclose conversations between himself and the president. That cut off lines of inquiry about the exact circumstances surrounding Comey's firing, what may have happened in the Feb. 14 Oval Office meeting in which Sessions was asked to leave so Trump could speak one-on-one with Comey, and Trump's reaction to Sessions' recusal. Sessions' legal rationale for his silence was muddled at best and deliberate interference at worst, something Democrats accused him of. \"My understanding is that you took an oath,\" said New Mexico Democrat Martin Heinrich in some of the sharpest questioning of the day. \"You raised your right hand here today, and you said that you would solemnly tell the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth. And now you're not answering questions. You're impeding this investigation.\" Democratic Sen. Ron Wyden of Oregon was even more blunt. \"I believe the American people have had it with stonewalling,\" he said. Sessions shot back: \"I am not stonewalling. I am following the historic policies of the Department of Justice. You don't walk into hearing or committee meeting and reveal confidential communications with the president of the United States, who is entitled to receive conventional communications in your best judgment about a host of issues, and have to be accused of stonewalling them.\" Sessions did not invoke \"executive privilege.\" As he acknowledged to Heinrich, \"I'm not able to invoke executive privilege. That's the president's prerogative.\" And yet, he told Sen. Joe Manchin, D-W.Va., who asked whether Sessions could \"speak more frankly\" in a closed session with senators, as Comey did: \"I'm not sure. The executive privilege is not waived by going in camera or in closed session.\" Sessions repeatedly clung to vague reasoning for not answering many of the senators' questions. He could not point to specific Justice Department language, even though Sessions said he had consulted with department attorneys before the hearing. Senators got just five minutes each to ask questions (the chairman and vice chairman got 10). When Sen. Kamala Harris, D-Calif., asked about Sessions' recollection of meetings with Russian officials or businessmen, he complained, \"I'm not able to be rushed this fast. It makes me nervous.\" When Republican Chairman Richard Burr of North Carolina noted that \"the senator's time has expired,\" a wide grin swept across Sessions' face, as he looked up at the chairman and former colleague. Round and round it went. And all of it probably made Sessions' boss very happy. \"He thought that Attorney General Sessions did a very good job,\" White House deputy press secretary Sarah Sanders told reporters, including NPR's Tamara Keith, traveling on Air Force One on Tuesday night. She added that Sessions \"in particular was very strong on the point that there was no collusion between Russia and the Trump campaign.\" Can't recall Sessions' silence kept a lid on important details that could have illuminated much more of the Russia story. He said he couldn't \"recall\" 18 times. It reminded Washington of another attorney general, who testified 10 years ago, Attorney General Alberto Gonzales. Gonzales, who served under President George W. Bush, said that he couldn't \"recall\" some 60 times in an April 2007 hearing about the dismissal of federal prosecutors, accusations of coordination with the White House and overall Justice Department leadership. Ironically, Sessions was one of the senators questioning Gonzales that day and expressed frustration with Gonzales' faulty memory. \"Well, I guess I'm concerned about your recollection, really, because it's not that long ago,\" Sessions said. \"It was an important issue. And that's troubling to me, I've got to tell you.\" Other attorneys general, of course, have evaded congressional questions. Eric Holder, President Barack Obama's attorney general, was held in contempt of Congress for invoking executive privilege and not turning over documents related to the \"Fast and Furious\" gun-tracking investigation. But if questions coming into Tuesday's hearing were \"How would Sessions respond to fired FBI Director James Comey's intimation that there was something else \u2014 something classified \u2014 about Sessions to be concerned about?\" or \"What more do we know about President Trump's role in firing Comey or putting pressure on officials to drop the Russia investigation?\" there wasn't much light shed on them. Having it in for Comey from the beginning What was learned, though, was that Sessions and Rod Rosenstein, now deputy attorney general, may have always been looking for a reason to fire Comey \u2014 and so was Trump. Sessions revealed that he and Rosenstein discussed before they were even confirmed getting rid of Comey. They wanted a \"fresh start,\" Sessions said. But Comey was kept on for months after they were both confirmed. And, like Trump, Sessions didn't exactly criticize Comey's handling of the Hillary Clinton email investigation during the presidential campaign. When Comey came forward in October just before the election saying he was reopening the investigation, Sessions praised him. \"Now, he's received new evidence,\" Sessions said on Fox Business. \"He had an absolute duty, in my opinion, 11 days or not, to come forward with the new information that he has and let the American people know that, too.\" He added that Comey, after being uncomfortable with the airplane meeting between former Attorney General Loretta Lynch and former President Bill Clinton, had \"stepped up and done what his duty is, I think.\" Sessions was critical of the investigation but seemingly only because it didn't \"get to the bottom\" of what happened. \"I think it should have used a grand jury,\" he said. Sessions wanted people put under oath. \"So you have to grill them, and people will surprise you how sometimes they'll just spill the beans when they're under oath like that.\" He then pointed out that with the \"new evidence,\" Sessions thought the investigation was \"back on track again.\" All that seems to undermine the rationale for Comey's firing that Sessions says he relied on \u2014 Rosenstein's memo that charged Comey acted inappropriately in the handling of the Clinton email investigation. It wasn't until the stars aligned, as the Russia investigation was heating up, that Sessions and Rosenstein could pull the plug, with at least Trump's blessing. Sessions also admitted that neither he nor Rosenstein, Comey's direct supervisor, ever talked to Comey about his job performance. And Trump himself undercut the reasoning for firing Comey that Sessions and Rosenstein had presented, saying he was going to fire Comey anyway \"regardless of recommendation.\" In Mueller's court The questions will continue, especially of everyone who steps before Congress, but Trump allies have proved that even going under oath won't shed light on the full details surrounding the Russia investigation and whether Trump pressured high-ranking officials to drop it. That is something that may have to be determined by Justice Department Special Counsel Robert Mueller when he releases his findings. And Trump allies have already been trying to insulate themselves and the president by attempting to delegitimize whatever Mueller comes up with. The irony, of course, is that if the president has done nothing wrong, as he has insisted all along, Mueller is the one guy in Washington who has the credibility to clear him.",

            "article_content": "Attorney General Sessions was emphatic in defending himself against suggestions of any wrongdoing during the 2016 campaign. He also declined to discuss his conversations with President Trump.  AUDIE CORNISH, HOST: Questions have swirled around Attorney General Jeff Sessions about his interactions with Russian officials while he was a Trump campaign surrogate and about what role he played in President Trump's firing of FBI Director James Comey. Now, today the attorney general got to answer those questions, and he pushed back forcefully. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) JEFF SESSIONS: Let me state this clearly, colleagues. I have never met with or had any conversation with any Russians or any foreign officials concerning any type of interference with any campaign or election in the United States. CORNISH: Sessions testified before the same Senate committee that heard from James Comey just last week. NPR national political correspondent Mara Liasson joins us in studio. Hey there, Mara. MARA LIASSON, BYLINE: Hi, Audie. CORNISH: So let's go back to that issue of contacts with the Russian ambassador. What did Jeff Sessions have to say about that? LIASSON: Well, Sessions has disclosed two meetings with the Russian ambassador while he was a campaign surrogate, and he insists they were done in his capacity as a senator, not as a surrogate even though he was one at the time. There was a suggestion that there may have been a third meeting that he never disclosed. That's the one that the FBI director, James Comey, alluded to in his open testimony, and he reportedly told senators about it behind closed doors. But Sessions denies that and denied that very emphatically in this heated exchange with Democratic Senator Ron Wyden. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) RON WYDEN: Mr. Comey said that there were matters with respect to the recusal that were problematic, and he couldn't talk about them. What are they? SESSIONS: I - that - why don't you tell me? There are none, Senator Wyden. There are none. I can tell you that for absolute certainty. WYDEN: We can... SESSIONS: You tell - this is a secret innuendo being leaked out there about me, and I don't appreciate it. And I've tried to give my best and truthful answers to any committee I've appeared before. And it's really - people are suggesting through innuendo that I have been not honest about matters, and I've tried to be honest. LIASSON: So very, very emphatic in defending himself. I think if Donald Trump was watching this testimony, which we understand he probably was today, he was probably pretty happy because Jeff Sessions really pushed back hard. He also refused categorically to talk about any conversations that he had with the president. He didn't declare executive privilege, but he did say it was the policy of the Department of Justice not to talk about conversations with the president. CORNISH: The other big topic along those lines was about James Comey's firing. What did Sessions have to say there? LIASSON: Well, he stuck to his - the reasons he gave for Comey's firing in that memo where they blamed Comey's handling of the Hillary Clinton email investigation. Today, Sessions said that he thought it was inappropriate that Comey decided not to prosecute her. The reason why this is really important is because he was asked subsequently by Susan Collins, Republican of Maine, if you were recused from all things Russia and from the Russia investigation, why were you involved in firing the guy, James Comey, who was conducting the Russia investigation? And he said, I was only recused from Russia. He said of course he didn't think he should be fired because of Russia - it was because the FBI needed a, quote, \"fresh start\" - even though President Trump has contradicted him and said that he did fire Comey because of Russia. CORNISH: Meanwhile, in the last 24 hours or so, some allies of President Trump have floated the idea that the president might consider firing special counsel Robert Mueller. He's the man running the Russia investigation. Is there anything to this? LIASSON: Well, one of the president's friends, Chris Ruddy, who's the CEO of Newsmax, a conservative website, said that the president was considering this, said he never actually spoke to the president about it, but he reported that it was under consideration. Now, in order to do this, Donald Trump would have to order the deputy attorney general, Rod Rosenstein, to fire Mueller. And Rosenstein, it turns out, was testifying on Capitol Hill today about another matter, and he was asked about this in another hearing. And here's what he said. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) ROD ROSENSTEIN: Senator, I'm not going to follow any orders unless I believe those are lawful and appropriate orders. Under the regulation, special counsel Mueller may be fired only for good cause, and I am required to put that cause in writing. And so that's what I would do. If there were a good cause, I would consider it. If there were not good cause, it wouldn't matter to me what anybody says. LIASSON: So he's pushing back pretty hard against the idea that he could be ordered to fire - that he would follow orders to fire Mueller. By and large, Republicans across the board say firing Mueller would not be a good thing, including Chris Ruddy, who started the whole story going. And today on a trip to Wisconsin, the president was asked many times by reporters shouting questions if he still had confidence in Mueller, and he did not answer. CORNISH: And a reminder that trip was policy-related, right? This White House... LIASSON: Policy-related... CORNISH: ...Still has an agenda. LIASSON: The White House still has an agenda. This week is supposed to be workforce development week. He was in Wisconsin to talk about workforce training. He also met with Obamacare victims for a couple of minutes. He did that in Ohio last week. And he had lunch with lawmakers where he talked about the Obamacare replacement bill. He is reported to have said that the White House Bill was too mean, and the Senate should make it more generous. But he also said he was very optimistic about a bill passing the Senate. CORNISH: That's NPR national political correspondent Mara Liasson. Thanks so much. LIASSON: Thank you. Copyright \u00a9 2017 NPR.  All rights reserved.

He was very, very adamant that he did not participate in any way, shape or form in colluding with the Russian government. Here's a little bit of what he said today. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) SESSIONS: The suggestion that I participated in any collusion, that I was aware of any collusion with the Russian government to hurt this country which I have served with honor for 35 years or to undermine the integrity of our democratic process is an appalling and detestable lie. LIASSON: And just to remind our listeners, the reason why this is an issue is because the attorney general had several contacts with Russian officials that he failed to disclose even when asked about them. And that is the reason that he had to recuse himself from anything having to do with the Russian investigation that former FBI Director James Comey was running before he was fired. CORNISH: Another big topic of course was Comey himself and his firing. What did Session (ph) have to say? LIASSON: Well, that was really interesting. First of all, Sessions absolutely refused to talk about any conversations he had with the president about this, any kinds of communications at all. He said he wasn't claiming executive privilege. Only the president can do that. But this is the procedure of the Department of Justice - that they never discuss communications with the White House. But he did say that he believed that Comey should be fired and not because of the Russia investigation. He stuck to the content of that original memo that Rod Rosenstein had written and that Comey sent to the president after the president, we now learned, had already desired - decided to fire Comey that Comey's problems were about the investigation into Hillary Clinton's emails. He said he believed that a fresh start was necessary. There was a very heated exchange about - Comey had testified that there were some reasons, some problematic things that that made Comey believe that Sessions would have to recuse himself even before he did. But Sessions pushed back against. That he said, that's secret innuendo; I don't appreciate it. When asked by Susan Collins of Maine, why were you involved in the firing of Comey If you had recused yourself from everything having to do with the Russia investigation, he said that was just a tiny part of my responsibilities as attorney general. The Russian investigation was just one thing, but I - Comey was fired for other reasons that I was not recused from. CORNISH: Meanwhile, in the last 24 hours, some allies of President Trump have floated the idea that the president might consider firing special counsel Robert Mueller. And this is the man who's currently running the Russia investigation. So what's the latest on that? LIASSON: Well, that was really interesting. Yesterday, Chris Ruddy, who's the CEO of Newsmax, a conservative website, was on PBS, said that the president was considering or had considered the possibility of firing Bob Mueller. He's - he has said he had never actually spoken to the president about this but that that was something the president was considering. Now, first of all, the president probably has considered firing almost everybody that he's ever - that has ever worked for him. But if the president was to do something like that, he'd have to order the deputy attorney general, Rod Rosenstein, to do it. And Rod Rosenstein, as it turns out, was also testifying on Capitol Hill in another hearing, and he was asked about that. Would he fire Bob Mueller? And here's what Rod Rosenstein said. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) ROD ROSENSTEIN: Senator, I'm not going to follow any orders unless I believe those are lawful and appropriate orders. Under the regulation, special counsel Mueller may be fired only for good cause, and I am required to put that cause in writing. And so that's what I would do. If there were a good cause, I would consider it. If there were not good cause, it wouldn't matter to me what anybody says. LIASSON: So he pushed back pretty hard against that idea. I can tell you that a chorus of Republican lawmakers have been saying that firing Mueller would not be a good thing at all. I suppose the president could fire Rod Rosenstein and keep on firing deputy AGs until he found one a la Nixon in the Saturday Night Massacre who would fire Mueller. But it doesn't sound like that is happening anytime soon. CORNISH: And the White House - are they still pushing their agenda, their policy agenda? LIASSON: Absolutely. The president is doing something called workforce training week, workforce development week. He went to Wisconsin today to talk about workforce training. He also met with Obamacare victims. He had a brief 10-minute meeting with them. This is very similar to a meeting he had with Obamacare victims in Ohio. He lunched with lawmakers, and he talked about how the repeal and replace bill to replace Obamacare is coming along really nicely. He sounds a lot more optimistic than Republicans are in the Senate.

The Trump White House had been considering Robert Mueller as a top candidate to lead the FBI before the deputy U.S. attorney general changed course and tapped Mueller to serve as special counsel investigating Russian interference in last year's election, two sources familiar with the process told NPR. Mueller had gone so far as to meet with Justice Department leaders and White House officials about the FBI job, which opened after President Trump fired Director James Comey on May 9. But that idea went by the wayside after Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein instead reached out to Mueller to run the politically sensitive Russia probe, which is examining ties between Russians and Trump campaign aides, the sources said. Mueller has long been considered one of Washington's most indispensable men. He served in top roles at the Justice Department and became President George W. Bush's FBI director only days before the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks devastated the country. President Barack Obama asked Mueller to continue to serve for two more years past the director's normal 10-year term, a move that required Congress to pass special legislation. Congress cited \"the critical need for continuity and stability at the Federal Bureau of Investigation in the face of ongoing threats to the United States and leadership transitions at the Federal agencies charged with protecting national security.\" That law stated that lawmakers had made a one-time exception and made it clear that Mueller \"may not serve as Director after September 4, 2013.\" The idea that the Trump administration had considered bringing Mueller back to the FBI underscores the difficulty it had in finding a replacement for the fired Comey \u2014 as well as Mueller's sterling reputation among both Democrats and Republicans in Washington. And the idea that Rosenstein, who had been criticized for his role in the dismissal of Comey, reached into the White House process to fill the FBI post and invited Mueller to serve as a Justice Department special counsel underscores the heavy pressure Rosenstein was under to find an independent law enforcement leader to take charge of the Russia probe. Rosenstein's selection won applause from Congress and Justice Department veterans, who said Mueller would do the job without fear or favor. Mueller is slowly filling his special counsel office with an all-star team. Beyond his law partners Aaron Zebley and James Quarles, who once worked on the Watergate team, Mueller has hired the head of the Justice Department's fraud section, Andrew Weissmann \u2014 a sign that the money trail will be critical in getting to the bottom of the Russia affair. He also brought on Jeannie Rhee, a former prosecutor and lawyer in the Obama Justice Department's Office of Legal Counsel, whose biography describes her background in \"criminal law, criminal procedure, executive privilege, civil rights and national security.\" On Friday, the National Law Journal reported that Mueller had enlisted Deputy U.S. Solicitor General Michael Dreeben, one of the most highly respected lawyers in the Justice Department, to work part time on the special counsel team. Dreeben plays a critical role in advising and defending the department's criminal prosecutions on appeal. Peter Carr, a spokesman for Mueller, declined comment for this report.",

It was a matter of urgency, former acting Attorney General Sally Yates says, when she called White House lawyers back in late January. She needed to tell them that Gen. Michael Flynn, then-national security adviser, appeared to be lying to the White House, making him vulnerable to blackmail by Moscow. \"We believed that Gen. Flynn was compromised with respect to the Russians,\" Yates told a Senate subcommittee on Monday. \"To state the obvious, you don't want your national security adviser compromised by the Russians.\" Four days later, Yates was fired, for refusing to defend President Trump's travel ban. Two weeks after that, Flynn was out \u2014 for lying to the White House about contacts with Russia, as Yates had alerted White House lawyers. The story Yates had warned about had reached the press. Yates, along with James Clapper, former director of national intelligence, appeared before the Senate Judiciary Committee's crime and terrorism subcommittee to testify on Russian attempts to interfere in the U.S. presidential election. Both witnesses had served under Obama. Yates remained in her role for 10 days after Trump's inauguration on Jan. 20 and then was fired. During that brief tenure she warned the White House that Flynn had made contact with Russians, which he was denying. Vice President Pence was publicly backing Flynn's false statements. Yates told the senators she informed the administration about Flynn's apparent lie for two reasons: one, because Flynn's behavior was \"problematic in and of itself,\" and two, because she believed Pence had \"the right to know\" the truth. She said she was sharing the information \u2014 over a series of two meetings and a phone call \u2014 so that the White House \"could act.\" In response, she says, one lawyer asked what it mattered to the Department of Justice if one White House official was lying to another. The senators in Monday's hearing asked about issues beyond just Flynn. But many of the highest-stake questions in the hearing ran up against a brick wall marked \"classified.\" Clapper said he could not comment on whether he was concerned about Trump's business interests in Russia. And as to whether there's evidence that members of the Trump campaign cooperated in Russian meddling, they were split: Clapper said he didn't know of any, while Yates said she couldn't comment. At the hearing on Monday \u2014 as at previous public hearings on the Russian investigation \u2014 there was a sharp partisan split in how senators approached the issue. Democrats focused extensively on Russian attempts to alter the outcome of the U.S. presidential election in Trump's favor, while most Republicans focused on leaks and the question of how Flynn's calls reached the press. (Both Yates and Clapper flatly denied having any involvement with the leaks.) Some Republican senators even turned their attention to Hillary Clinton's emails and Yates' refusal to defend Trump's executive order on travel. The president tweeted after the hearing, calling congressional investigations into the possibility that his campaign colluded with Russia a \"taxpayer funded charade.\" He said the \"biggest story,\" which he accused the media of underreporting, is \"on surveillance.\" Questions about what kind of surveillance it is legal for U.S. intelligence agencies to do, and whether intelligence from such surveillance has been mishandled, did come up during the hearing and have been reported on extensively for the past few months. Credit:  U.S. Capitol You can read about the hearing, as it happened, below. 5:30 p.m. ET: Both witnesses call for defensive action against future meddling Asked about what needs to be done to defend against future Russian actions, Yates said, \"I think they're coming back ... and I think we have to do a whole lot more \u2014 to harden our election systems, to ensure that folks out there know when they're looking at news feeds that it may not be real news that they're reading. \"I think that we have to do more to deter the Russians, and it wouldn't hurt to prosecute a few folks, but I don't think we can fool ourselves that we can prosecute our way out of this problem,\" she said. \"I think the most important thing we need to do here is to educate the electorate ... about Russian tactics and procedures, that they have employed and I predict will continue to employ,\" Clapper said. He also said U.S. election systems should be considered critical infrastructure and called for more sanctions and improved countermessaging against Russia. 5:15 p.m. ET: Clapper declines to comment on Trump's business interests in Russia Subcommittee Chairman Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., asked Clapper if he had, in the course of investigations, come across business ties Trump had to Russia that caused concern. There was a pause, then this exchange: Clapper: Not in the course of the preparation of the intelligence community assessment. Graham: Since? ... At all? Anytime? Clapper: Sen. Graham, I can't comment on that, because that impacts an investigation. Graham: It wasn't enough to put into the report? Clapper: That's correct. 5:10 p.m. ET: Questions about Flynn's security clearance At a news conference earlier Monday, White House press secretary Sean Spicer said that Flynn received a security clearance during his time with the Obama administration and that it was never withdrawn. He had the \"same clearance\" as national security adviser, Spicer said. \"Everyone in the government goes through the same process,\" Spicer said. As for vetting Flynn, Spicer said, \"That was something that was adjudicated by the Obama administration.\" Sen. Mazie Hirono, D-Hawaii, asked Clapper whether that was true. Clapper said he couldn't comment on Flynn specifically \u2014 but that there are very different levels of vetting for different roles. \"I know what I went through as a political appointee, twice, in a Republican and Democratic administration, and the vetting process for either a political appointee or someone working with the White House is far more invasive and far, far more thorough than a standard TS/SCI clearance process,\" Clapper said. \"But I don't know what process was used in Gen. Flynn's case.\" He reiterated later that serving in a high-level role in the White House has, in previous administrations, required vetting above and beyond a standard security clearance. NBC has reported that Flynn was required to get a new security clearance to serve as national security adviser, but the process was never completed; he was pushed out of the job before he received that higher clearance, NBC reported, citing one anonymous source. 5:05 p.m. ET: Yates won't confirm whether Flynn lied to the FBI Yates said she couldn't comment on whether Flynn lied during his interview with the FBI, citing an ongoing investigation. She did confirm that if Flynn did lie, he could potentially face criminal prosecution. 5:00 p.m. ET: Al Franken poses a lengthy hypothetical Sen. Al Franken, D-Minn., used one of his questions to, well, not really ask a question. He was talking to Yates about the 18-day delay between when she alerted the White House to Flynn's apparent lie, and when Flynn was forced to resign: \"Is it possible that the reason he didn't fire him then is that [he thought], 'Well, if I fire him for talking to the Russians about sanctions ... what about all the other people on my team who coordinated?' \"You ask yourself, why wouldn't you fire a guy who did this. And all I can think of is that he would say, 'Well, we've got all these other people in the administration who have had contacts; we've had all these other people in the administration who coordinated.' ... \"We're trying to put a puzzle together here, everybody, and maybe, just maybe, he didn't get rid of a guy who lied to the vice president, who got paid by the Russians, who went on Russia Today, because there are other people in his administration who met secretly with the Russians and didn't reveal it until later, until they were caught. That may be why it took him 18 days \u2014 until it became public \u2014 to get rid of Mike Flynn, who was a danger to this republic.\" \"Care to comment?\" Franken asked Yates. \"I don't think I'm going to touch that, senator,\" she said. 4:25 p.m. ET: Russian hacking is cheap; does WikiLeaks do journalism? Sen. Ben Sasse, R-Neb., asked Clapper about the threat from Russia \u2014 among other things, whether congressional IT systems could be a target of hacking, which Clapper said was certainly possible. He also asked about how much money Russia spends on hacking and propaganda efforts. \"I can't give you a figure,\" Clapper said. \"I will say in comparison to classical military expenditures it's a bargain for them.\" Then Sasse raised the question of WikiLeaks, as he did with FBI Director James Comey last week. He asked whether the group is a \"known propaganda effort for Russia,\" as U.S intelligence officials have called it. He asked Clapper, \"You're saying that Julian Assange is not a journalist?\" \"You're asking the wrong guy,\" Clapper said, laughing. \"He certainly is not.\" \"When a journalist does harm to the country, harm to our national security, compromises sensitive sources ... and deliberately puts the country in jeopardy, I think that's a red line,\" Clapper said. 4:15 p.m. ET: Yates repeats her goal was to allow White House to \"take action\" regarding Flynn In her answers to the senators, Yates has repeatedly emphasized that she was briefing White House lawyers on Flynn's behavior so that the administration \"could take action.\" She says the Department of Justice was \"very concerned\" and that in conversations with the White House, she emphasized \"repeatedly\" that they were sharing the information to enable the administration to act. 3:55 p.m. ET: Conversation pivots to Trump's travel ban, Clinton's emails In a diversion from the topic at hand, Sen. John Cornyn, R-Texas, challenged Yates over her decision not to defend Trump's travel ban. That prompted Sen. Dick Durbin, D-Ill., to defend Yates \u2014 and then express frustration with the Senate subcommittee's lack of resources dedicated to the question at the heart of the hearing, that is, Russian meddling in the election. Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, then asked \"hypothetical\" questions about Hillary Clinton's emails, as well as further questions about Trump's executive order on travel. As the conversations about the travel ban continued, Yates confirmed that she met with White House counsel \u2014 to discuss Flynn \u2014 on the same afternoon that the White House was preparing to issue the executive order on immigration. They did not tell her of the plans, she said: As acting attorney general she learned about the order after it was issued, from media coverage. 3:45 p.m. ET: Yates says it \"certainly appeared\" that Flynn lied Yates told the senators the Department of Justice had two concerns over Flynn's actions. One was that he could be vulnerable to blackmail by Russia. \"Compromise was certainly the No. 1 concern,\" she said. \"The Russians can use compromised material in a variety of ways, sometimes overtly, sometime subtly, and again our concern was that you have a very sensitive position \u2014 like the national security adviser \u2014 and you don't want that person to be in a position where the Russians have leverage.\" But they also felt that Pence had the \"right to know\" that evidence contradicted the statements he was making, as he defended Flynn in public. Asked if Flynn lied to Pence, Yates said, \"That's certainly how it appeared, yes \u2014 because the vice president went out and made statements that he said were based on what Gen. Flynn had told him,\" and which the DOJ knew \"flatly\" weren't true, Yates said. 3:15 p.m. ET: Yates says she told the White House multiple times that Flynn's conduct was \"problematic\" Yates says she spoke with White House counsel twice in person, and once over the phone, about Flynn's \"conduct.\" She wouldn't detail what the conduct was, saying that was classified, but identified it as \"problematic in and of itself.\" The first meeting was on Jan. 26, when Yates told the White House that there was evidence of Flynn's conduct that contradicted public statements by Vice President Pence. Yates says she was not accusing Pence of \"providing false information\" but wanted to make sure the White House was aware of the disparity. Yates also says she informed the White House that Flynn had been interviewed by the FBI, but without specifying what happened in that interview. It was a matter of urgency, Yates said. \"We believed that Gen. Flynn was compromised with respect to the Russians,\" Yates said. \"... To state the obvious, you don't want your national security adviser compromised by the Russians.\" But she says the Department of Justice, despite feeling this sense of urgency, was also trying not to interfere in an active FBI investigation. Flynn was forced to resign as national security adviser 18 days after Yates met with White House lawyers. 3:10 p.m. ET: Clapper, Yates both say they don't know how Flynn's conversations reached the press Graham asked Yates and Clapper how the White House learned that Flynn had conversations with the Russian ambassador. That's a question that President Trump had called for the senators to ask \u2014 in line with Republican allegations that an Obama official leaked classified information about Flynn. Both witnesses said they did not know the answer. Later, both denied serving as an anonymous source, or authorizing anyone else to serve as an anonymous source, in connection with the story. 3:10 p.m. ET: Yates says she can't comment on possibility of Trump campaign collusion Yates refused to say whether intelligence exists that shows a member of the Trump campaign colluded with the Kremlin. \"My answer to that question would require me to reveal classified information,\" Yates said. But she urged the senators not to take that nonanswer as confirmation that evidence does exist, saying she was taking the same approach as FBI Director James Comey to a question that centers on a classified investigation. Clapper had a different answer to the question, saying flatly that he did not know of any evidence. Further pressing by the senators raised the point that it was at least possible for individuals with the Department of Justice to have access to information that Clapper, as director of national intelligence, did not \u2014 because of the high level of secrecy around counterintelligence investigations. 2:55 p.m. ET: Clapper pushes back on concerns over unmasking Graham, in his opening remarks, raised unmasking as a major area of concern. \"Unmasking\" is how American officials can learn the names of Americans caught up in \"incidental collection\" \u2014 that is, people overheard or mentioned as the U.S. is surveilling a foreign target. (You can read more about both concepts in our background material above.) Some Republicans have expressed concern that Flynn may have been \"unmasked,\" and then his identity leaked to the press, for political purposes instead of for legitimate intelligence reasons. \"I've learned a bit about unmasking and what I've learned is disturbing,\" Graham said. \"I'd like to know more and I want to make sure that that unmasking can never be used as a political weapon in our democracy.\" Clapper explained that an official asking for unmasking has to justify why the name is needed and that the name is shared only with the person requesting it. Clapper said he had personally requested unmasking several times. \"At no time did I ever submit a request for personal or political purposes, or to voyeuristically look at raw intelligence, nor am I aware of any instance of such abuse by anyone else,\" Clapper wrote. 2:45 p.m. ET: Witnesses warn that their testimony is constrained As he opened the hearing, Graham noted that the U.S. intelligence community has been \"unanimous\" in concluding that Russia was meddling in the U.S. election. While Russian hacking and propaganda was designed to help Trump and hurt Hillary Clinton, Graham said, such foreign interference is a bipartisan issue. \"It could be our campaigns next,\" he told his fellow senators. \"When one party is attacked, all of us should feel an attack.\" The subcommittee's ranking member, Sheldon Whitehouse, D-R.I., went into much greater detail about what Russia is known or believed to have done to influence the U.S. election. \"We need a more thorough accounting of the facts,\" Whitehouse said. Meanwhile, Yates and Clapper both warned the subcommittee that they won't be able to answer pressing questions as fully as the senators might like. \"Many of the topics of interest today concern classified information that I cannot address in this public setting, either directly or indirectly,\" Yates wrote in her statement, published on Graham's website. She also said she is \"not authorized\" to discuss deliberations within the Department of Justice or the executive branch, \"particularly on matters that may be the subject of ongoing investigations.\" Clapper, for his part, said the White House cited executive privilege and \"requested\" additional limits to what he can discuss in the hearing. 2:30 p.m. ET: NPR's Phil Ewing provides a preview of what's expected to be discussed: \"Democrats want Yates to describe what she told White House officials shortly after President Trump's inauguration about the FBI's investigation into then-national security adviser Michael Flynn. Yates' Jan. 26 meeting in the executive mansion reportedly was to notify the administration that the FBI believed Flynn could be vulnerable to Russian blackmail. He resigned weeks later. ... \"Graham and Republicans, however, want to ask the witnesses about how details of Flynn's conversations, and other classified information, found their way into The Washington Post and other newspapers ahead of Trump's inauguration.\" Trump had been cautioned about Flynn even before the heads-up from Yates on Jan. 26, according to a former Obama official. The official tells NPR that the president himself warned Trump, then incoming president, about Flynn's job performance. Flynn was formerly the head of the Defense Intelligence Agency but was fired during the Obama administration. White House press secretary Sean Spicer confirmed on Monday that \"President Obama made it clear that he was not a fan of Gen. Flynn's.\" But Spicer suggested that wasn't surprising \u2014 given Flynn's criticisms of Obama \u2014 and could have been interpreted as \"bad blood\" instead of a substantive warning. \"If President Obama was truly concerned, why didn't he suspend Gen. Flynn's security clearance?\" Spicer asked.",

Yates is scheduled to appear before the Senate Judiciary Committee on May 8.\n                \n                    \n                    Pete Marovich/Getty Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption Then-Deputy Attorney General Sally Yates speaks during a news conference at the Department of Justice in Washington, D.C., in 2016. Yates is scheduled to appear before the Senate Judiciary Committee on May 8. Two Obama administration officials will testify before the Senate Judiciary Committee as part of ongoing investigations into Russian meddling in the 2016 presidential election. The U.S. intelligence community has concluded that Russia attempted to help Donald Trump win the election. The Senate Judiciary Committee is one of multiple bodies \u2014 including the House Intelligence Committee, the Senate Intelligence Committee and the FBI \u2014 examining what exactly Russia did and whether the Trump campaign was involved, among other questions. Former acting Attorney General Sally Yates and former Director of National Intelligence James Clapper are scheduled to appear before the Senate Judiciary Committee on May 8. Yates and Clapper, along with former CIA Director John Brennan, were previously scheduled to testify before the House Intelligence Committee \u2014 the most prominent and public investigation to date \u2014 in late March. But those plans were scuttled amid a simmering soap opera of distrust and missteps within the House committee. Yates, specifically, was at the center of one portion of the drama: Multiple sources accused the White House of attempting to block her from testifying. Rep. Adam Schiff, the ranking Democrat on the House committee, told NPR that the Trump administration worked behind the scenes to stop Yates' testimony. He said White House officials were worried about what she would reveal about the administration's response when Yates told them about the investigation into Michael Flynn. (Flynn briefly served as national security adviser, resigning after it was revealed he had concealed his contacts with the Russian ambassador.) The Washington Post also reported that the White House tried to block Yates from testifying. The newspaper published letters exchanged by the Justice Department and Yates' lawyer, in which the Justice Department says Yates' communications are \"likely\" covered by executive privilege, which would mean it is up to the president whether they are disclosed. The Trump administration has denied putting pressure on the House investigation and called the Post story \"entirely false.\" The House Intelligence Committee is also continuing its investigation into Russian meddling. FBI Director James Comey and national security adviser Michael Rogers \u2014 who already testified at an open hearing last month \u2014 will also appear before that committee in a closed hearing on May 2. Yates, Clapper and Brennan are also set to appear before the committee in an open hearing later in May. A number of Trump campaign members, including Roger Stone, Carter Page and Paul Manafort, have volunteered to give testimony to the various investigations. Flynn has suggested he will testify if he is given immunity from prosecution. All those men have been under scrutiny over ties to Russia. As part of the investigation into Russian meddling, Republicans on the House Intelligence Committee are also extremely interested in a different set of issues: who leaked classified information about ties between the Trump team and Russia, who requested that names of Trump associates be \"unmasked\" and whether intelligence was abused for political purposes. Meanwhile, there are reports, citing anonymous sources, that the Senate Intelligence Committee's investigation into Russian meddling efforts is stagnating. The Senate investigation, unlike the House investigation, is taking place almost entirely behind closed doors. Tim Mak of The Daily Beast reports that there are no full-time staff members working on the Senate inquiry and that \"no interviews have been conducted with key individuals.\" And Michael Isikoff of Yahoo News reports that the committee \"has yet to issue a single subpoena for documents,\" in addition to failing to interview any central witnesses.",

California Rep. Adam Schiff wants Rep. Devin Nunes to recuse himself from the House Intelligence Committee's investigation into last year's meddling by Russia in the presidential election\n                \n                    \n                    Ariel Zambelich/NPR\n                    \n                \nhide caption California Rep. Adam Schiff wants Rep. Devin Nunes to recuse himself from the House Intelligence Committee's investigation into last year's meddling by Russia in the presidential election The upshot of the day's back-and-forth was this: Former Acting Attorney General Sally Yates, a holdover from the previous administration whom President Trump fired on Jan. 31, is not barred by the White House from testifying in open hearings in Congress. When \u2014 or whether \u2014 Yates actually does appear is another matter. She was supposed to have been on a panel Tuesday, along with other former national security leaders who served under President Obama. But that hearing, and then another closed session that took its place, were both canceled last week. The House Intelligence Committee's top Democrat, Adam Schiff, charged on Tuesday that the White House had interfered behind the scenes to stop Yates from appearing. Administration officials were nervous, Schiff said in an interview with NPR journalists, about what Yates might reveal about the FBI and Justice Department's investigation into former national security adviser Michael Flynn \u2014 and how President Trump and his team responded. Yates met with White House officials shortly after Trump's inauguration to tell them Flynn was under FBI investigation and that he hadn't told the truth about his contacts with Russian Ambassador Sergey Kislyak. Not only that but the Russians' knowledge about what Flynn had said left him open to blackmail, the FBI warned. At the same moments that Schiff was making that connection in a visit to NPR headquarters, another story appeared from The Washington Post: The White House might consider Yates' comments from her time as acting attorney general to be covered by executive privilege. The Post cited letters from Yates' attorneys to the Justice Department. Almost as soon as that story appeared, the White House denied it. Spokesman Sean Spicer called it \"entirely false.\" Later, in a briefing with reporters, he was given a chance to clarify more broadly \u2014 so executive privilege would not be an issue for Yates? \"That's correct,\" Spicer said. And had the White House put any pressure on House Intelligence Committee Chairman Devin Nunes to cancel the hearing at which Yates was scheduled to appear? \"No,\" Spicer said. Nunes' independence, however, has been called into question by Schiff and some other members of Congress following the last big cliffhanger in this melodrama. Last week, Nunes made a secret visit to the White House to meet a person he called a confidential source \u2014 a visit that Nunes and Spicer say was unknown to Trump and his aides. During his trip, Nunes said, he viewed documents that show Trump and his transition team were swept up in U.S. surveillance of foreign targets after the election. Nunes does not have those documents, he said, nor has he shared them with any of the Republicans or Democrats on the committee. The morning after Nunes' visit, he convened a press conference at the Capitol to tell reporters he had gotten information that partly verified Trump's earlier claim that Obama had, if not \"wiretapped him,\" conducted some kind of surveillance. Nunes then traveled to the White House because, he said, he needed to brief Trump on what he had learned, and then he talked with reporters again before returning to the Capitol to meet with Schiff. That has prompted Schiff to call for Nunes to recuse himself from the Intelligence Committee's investigation into last year's meddling by Russia in the presidential election. Nunes said Tuesday he would not. Schiff told NPR journalists that the situation was not \"sustainable,\" but if he and Democrats were to walk away from the process, the chamber's only Russia investigation would very likely fold. Schiff and a few key Republicans, including Arizona Sen. John McCain, want some kind of independent process to look into the Russia story \u2014 a select committee, or a special commission like that created after the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks. House and Senate leaders, however, are unlikely to agree, and Trump would not sign legislation to create such a commission. So the House Intelligence Committee saga rolls on, at least in name only. The panel has no public hearings on its calendar, but Schiff told NPR on Tuesday that Republican and Democratic staffers are continuing to review documents and assemble lists of potential witnesses. A number of Trump campaign aides, including Trump's son-in-law, Jared Kushner, who serves as a top adviser inside the White House, have said they would \"volunteer\" to talk with congressional investigators. Meanwhile, the next story arc is expected to get underway later this week when the leaders of the Senate Intelligence Committee step into the center ring. Republican Chairman Richard Burr of North Carolina and Democratic Vice Chairman Mark Warner of Virginia are scheduled to brief reporters on Wednesday, then have their first hearing on Thursday. Our original post, from 12:26 p.m. ET A key House Democrat on Tuesday blamed the White House for preventing a former top Justice Department leader from testifying in public about the Trump campaign's potential ties to Russian election meddling. Former acting Attorney General Sally Yates, a holdover from the Obama administration who was fired by President Trump on Jan. 31, reportedly notified the White House ahead of an appearance that was scheduled for an open hearing before the House Intelligence Committee this week. Republican Rep. Devin Nunes, the committee chairman, then canceled that hearing and another closed session that was supposed to have taken its place. The top Democrat on the panel, California Rep. Adam Schiff, told NPR journalists on Tuesday that he believes the White House's worries about what Yates might say led administration leaders to tell the Justice Department not to authorize Yates' testimony. \"Sally Yates had a big role to play in why this hearing was canceled,\" Schiff said. She could have discussed the details about what the FBI and Justice Department knew about former national security adviser Michael Flynn's talks with Russian Ambassador Sergey Kislyak, Schiff said. \"It wouldn't surprise me at all if there was a vigorous pushback on having her testify, among other things, about how long did [Trump] know Flynn had lied before he was willing to do anything about it?\" Separately, The Washington Post reported on Tuesday that the Trump administration told Yates that what she might have said publicly violated the executive branch's privilege about internal communications. White House spokesman Sean Spicer disputes the Post report. In a statement Tuesday, he said: \"The Washington Post story is entirely false. The White House has taken no action to prevent Sally Yates from testifying and the Department of Justice specifically told her that it would not stop her and to suggest otherwise is completely irresponsible.\" Yates notified the White House shortly after Trump was inaugurated that Flynn was the target of an FBI investigation and may have been subject to Russian blackmail because he hadn't told the truth about his discussions with Kislyak. Trump fired her over a separate issue \u2014 Yates told the Justice Department's attorneys not to defend in court Trump's order restricting travel from some Muslim-majority countries. Yates may still appear before Nunes and Schiff's committee, Schiff said on Tuesday, but no hearings are on the calendar and the process is still in disarray after a strange back-and-forth last week. Nunes revealed that he had seen secret documents that suggested Trump and his aides had been swept up in U.S. surveillance of foreign targets. He declined to share the documents with his fellow committee members \u2014 even Republicans \u2014 and it later emerged he didn't even have them in his possession. Nunes went to the White House to view them late one night, then convened a press conference the next morning and returned to the White House because he said he needed to brief Trump about what he had learned. That kerfuffle, along with Nunes' decision to cancel this week's hearings, led Schiff to call for Nunes to recuse himself from the Russia investigation. Nunes said on Tuesday he would not. So the inquiry technically continues to go forward, but now with partisan overtones. Schiff and some Republicans, including Arizona Sen. John McCain, want a special process to investigate Russia's election meddling, either a select committee within the Congress or something like the 9/11 Commission that followed the 2001 terrorist attacks. But Republican leaders in the House and Senate appear unenthusiastic about anything like that and Trump would not sign any legislation that created a nuisance for himself.",

Lots went on, per usual. Let's get to it. A new documentary challenges the narrative we've heard for the past two years about the late Michael Brown. Stranger Fruit, which debuted at the SXSW Film Festival earlier this week, re-examines the hours leading up to Brown's death at the hand of officer Darren Wilson. And gives rise to questions for many. Not, apparently, the St. Louis police, who didn't release the footage earlier because they deemed it irrelevant to the investigation. In another police-related story, a young white man juggles himself out of a parking ticket, while recording it on his phone. April Reign points out in The Washington Post what would likely happen if the juggler had been black. Remember last week we talked about the new sports hijab Nike has developed for observant Muslim athletes? Many athletes seemed to like it fine. Not so much a slew of young, presumably white, feminists who began voicing their outrage on social media. Teen Vogue says some are threatening to boycott Nike for aiding in the oppression of Muslim women. Doesn't look as if any of the protesters are themselves Muslim, though. (Maybe we should send them last week's podcast on allies?) On the Muslim-related front, this mini-doc from the news site AJ+, features Indian-Americans and immigrants talking about how rising Islamophobia is worrying them. Even though they're from an entirely different religion. And in a counter-Islamophobic note, a terrific story from The Fader about the Minnesota House's first Somali Muslim elected official. Muslim ban? Rep. Ilhan Omar's not having any of that. One of our favorite literary heroines, Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie, says we're all women, but we're not all the same kind of women. She argued that trans women have had one thing cis women haven't: male privilege before they became women. There was immediate outrage from several trans women. And Adichie has walked that back a little bit. Because words mean something, we're pleased to point out we're now an official part of the language. Kind of. Word of the Day, people. Back in the high life again: Snoop Dogg dropped a video this week that clowned POTUS and his supporters, focusing, really, on a clown figure with a recognizable blond helmet of hair. There's some faux gun violence (the squirt variety) and after an angry tweet from the White House, it's gone viral. Watch \u2014 but not around young people. (And if you watch at work, use headphones.) Ah, the race card \u2014 where would we be without it? Our own Leah Donnella has this splendid little nugget about a game where players decide who is blacker than whom. And I'll just leave it at that. Don't worry about who is what: you do you. We'll see you next week.",

Now, as the Obama presidency winds down, Perez is running for head of the Democratic National Committee. After big losses in state Houses, Congress, and the White House, the Democratic Party is looking for a new leader. NPR has been talking to several candidates for chair of the Democratic National Committee. On Friday, All Things Considered host Audie Cornish chatted with one who is closely tied to the Obama administration, Tom Perez. The Maryland resident is the president's labor secretary but spoke in his personal capacity. He vowed to fight Donald Trump's agenda when it goes against Democratic principles, said he wants to lead the DNC by focusing on party infrastructure and grass-roots organizing, and argued that Democrats have \"gotten away from the basics as a party,\" but he sidestepped when asked if he thought the DNC put a finger on the scale for Hillary Clinton in the Democratic primary. On the DNC's failures in organizing Organizing has to be a 12-month endeavor. You can't show up at a church every fourth October and say, \"Vote for me,\" and call that persuasion. And that's what we've done. We've gotten away from the basics as a party. And what I want to do, if I have the good fortune of being elected chair, is do exactly that. Build a party infrastructure in partnership with our state partners so that we have organizers in place in urban, suburban and rural communities across America, so that we are a force on important issues \u2014 whether it's voting rights, as I've discussed, whether it's cybersecurity, and we need to have a director of cybersecurity at the DNC, which we currently don't have. On hacking during the election, and what is revealed about the DNC favoring Clinton over Sanders Well, we have to have transparency. We have to have inclusion. And we have to have a leader, who will listen. So, for instance, one of the things that I would want to do, if I have the privilege of being elected, is to set up a structure so that we will have a debate calendar in place prior to when we know who the candidates are, so that we can eliminate any sort of perception that \u2014 or reality \u2014 that the thumb was being placed on the scale of justice to help one candidate or another. I think we have to do things like that and we have to earn the trust of every stakeholder in the party. And I think we can do that, because the reality, Audie, is that we are fighting much bigger forces. Donald Trump's vision of America, his nativist vision of America, his fearmongering, that's what we have to fight.\" ... Audie Cornish: After that episode and what we know now, do you essentially believe that the DNC tipped the scales in one way or another during the primary? Perez: Well, listen, I think the DNC made a number of mistakes during the primary. But this is not what happened yesterday. This is about what we have to do in the future. And what we have to do in the future is build a Democratic Party that works for everyone. I think our big tent is our greatest strength. Cornish: But there may be some Sanders fans who want the next DNC chair to say, \"Yes, this happened. We made a mistake and we're moving forward.\" Perez: And we have to always learn from what we did. That's why I said before, Audie, that one of the things I would do, if I had the privilege of being the DNC chair, is set forth a, for instance, debate schedule in which we would set that far in advance of when we knew who the candidates would be. And that's a way to ensure that the playing field is level. I think it's very important for the DNC chair to be that honest broker. And that's what I would aspire to do if I had the privilege of being the DNC chair. And I'm confident that I could do it. On Democrats' strategy for dealing with Trump Well, we need to take the fight to Donald Trump. If they're talking about deporting children, we're gonna take the fight to Donald Trump. If Donald Trump wants to raise the minimum wage to $15, yes, I will work with Donald Trump. If Donald Trump wants to pass comprehensive immigration reform, I will work with Donald Trump. If Donald Trump wants to acknowledge that we have a pay gap for women and we need to address it, I would work with Donald Trump. But you know what? If they are going to try to have a deportation task force, and they're gonna try to continue to deny climate change, you're damn right we need to fight. And we will continue that fight. Because this is the battle for the heart and soul of who we are as Americans.",

Then-Senate Majority Leader Bob Dole of Kansas is at right. The House and Senate are back in Washington today for the start of the 115th Congress. With GOP control of both chambers and soon the Oval Office, Republicans are promising an aggressive agenda that will prioritize the repeal of the current president's signature achievement, the Affordable Care Act. The Senate is expected to start that process with a budget resolution this week. After the pomp and circumstance of taking the official oath and the swearing-in of new members is complete, the top Congressional priority is usually given the honor of being introduced as House Resolution 1, or \"H.R. 1\" for short. With the rollback of Obamacare working first through the Senate, Republican Speaker Paul Ryan will not take the privilege of introducing that as H.R. 1, but looking back at the first bill to be introduced in the House in past sessions of Congress gives a glimpse at the priorities of legislators at the time. American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 Speaker at bill introduction: Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif. Control of House: Democratic Control of Senate: Democratic Final action on bill: Signed into law by President Barack Obama The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 is the official name for what is generally known as \"the stimulus.\" Washington was 180 degrees from where things are in 2017 \u2014 Democrats had control of both the House and the Senate and Barack Obama had just won the presidency. Then-House Speaker Nancy Pelosi used the H.R. 1 designation for the bill which was intended to address the effects of the Great Recession. Eventually Congress passed the behemoth $787 billion plan, which aimed to save or create millions of jobs and funneled spending to highway infrastructure investments, improvements to public housing and expanding broadband access to underserved areas. Before its passage, President Obama lobbied hard to get congressional Republicans to support the legislation, but the measure failed to garner a single GOP House member and only three Republican senators. Full-Year Continuing Appropriations Act, 2011 Speaker at bill introduction: John Boehner, R-Ohio Control of House: Republican Control of Senate: Democratic Final action on bill: Died in the 112th Congress, but later became the legislative vehicle for Disaster Relief Appropriations Act in the next Congress. Following the 2010 midterm elections, Republicans picked up a net total of 63 House seats and regained control of the chamber. Much of the Democrats' historic losses were blamed on a sluggish economy and backlash to the passage of the Affordable Care Act. With Republicans back in control of the House, Speaker John Boehner sought to make good on the GOP election-year promise to restore \"fiscal sanity\" and cut back on government spending. He used H.R. 1 to introduce Rep. Hal Rogers' Full-Year Continuing Appropriations Act, 2011 bill to do just that. In a statement, Rogers said at the time that the bill's spending reductions were \"historic.\" \"HR 1 provides $1.028 trillion for discretionary programs through the remainder of fiscal year 2011, a level $100 billion below the level President Obama requested in his fiscal year 2011 budget one year ago.\" But this was the start of the so-called \"Do-Nothing\" era of Congress \u2013 not a whole lot was being done with a divided government as Democrats maintained control of the Senate and White House. Though the bill passed easily in the House and was sent over to the Senate, no consequential action was made on it. That is not until December of 2012. By that time two major events had taken place: President Obama was re-elected and Hurricane Sandy walloped the East Coast with New York and New Jersey taking the brunt of the storm. It was one of the costliest storms in our nation's history and more than 100 people died in the U.S. alone. When the Senate finally took action on the measure, it became the legislative vehicle to supply funds for disaster relief efforts. The Senate amended the bill and passed it late in the year. According to the website GovTrack.us, the bill died in the 112th Congress because differences between the House and Senate versions of the measure were never resolved. The bill was reintroduced in the 113th Congress and came to be known as the Disaster Relief Appropriations Act, 2013.

Speaker at bill introduction: Nancy Pelosi, D-CA Control of House: Democratic Control of Senate: Democratic Final action on bill: Signed into law by President George W. Bush Nancy Pelosi's first legislative action as Speaker of the House was bringing this bill up for a vote. Fresh off their sweeping gains in the 2006 midterm elections that gave Democrats control of Congress, members were eager to demonstrate their national security prowess as the Iraq War dragged on Republicans. It had been more than five years since the 2001 terrorist attacks and Democrats intended to make good on a campaign promise to put in place many of the recommendations put forth by the 9/11 Commission, which was released in July 2004. The highlights of this legislation included funding increases to state and local government anti-terrorism efforts and mandating the Department of Homeland Security inspect all cargo arriving in the U.S. by sea and plane. A provision was added before President Bush signed it into law favored by many Republicans that shielded Americans who report suspicious activity to authorities. When he signed it into law in August 2007, Bush said he was \"pleased\" by this addition but also called for Congress to take further oversight action. \"There is still other work to be done. I continue to believe that Congress should act on the outstanding 9/11 Commission recommendations to reform the legislative branch's oversight of intelligence and counter-terrorism activities, which the Commission described as dysfunctional.\" Congressional Accountability Act of 1995 Speaker at bill introduction: Newt Gingrich, R-GA Control of House: Republican Control of Senate: Republican  Final action on bill: Signed into law by President Bill Clinton Like our previous entry, this piece of legislation was the first introduced at the beginning of a Congress in which one party, this time the Republicans, were fresh off historic gains. The 1994 midterms elections, commonly referred to as the \"Republican Revolution,\" saw the GOP take control of the Senate and seize control of the House for the first time in 40 years. Seeking to put forth conservative principles outlined in the \"Contract with America,\" which the new House Speaker Newt Gingrich was chief architect of, the Congressional Accountability Act of 1995 was given the status of H.R. 1. This bill made certain that rules governing private sector workplaces are applicable to Congress. The bill passed the House with no opposition 429-0. The Senate passed their version in similarly overwhelming fashion and President Clinton signed it into law. The action would apply a number of major laws to Congress including the Fair Labor Standards Act, which establishes minimum wage and overtime pay to employees, and the Americans with Disabilities Act that prohibits discrimination against people physical or mental challenges. The law also established the Office of Compliance, which covers more than 30,000 federal workers. It is a non-partisan independent federal agency created to enforce the law and to serve as a place for workers to file complaints.

The bill also required agencies to include instructions for the public to obtain agency reports on \"each proposed and final major rule instructions.\" Democratic House Speaker Tip O'Neill slated regulation reform for the H.R. 1 designation following the landslide 1980 elections marked the start of the conservative Reagan era.

            "article_content": "Credit:  U.S. Capitol Updated at 5:37 p.m. ET Attorney General Jeff Sessions told a Senate committee Tuesday that any suggestion he colluded with Russia during last year's U.S. presidential campaign was an \"appalling and detestable lie.\" Sessions spent more than 2 1/2 hours before the Senate Intelligence Committee, which included several testy exchanges with Democratic senators who accused him of obstructing their investigation. Throughout the questioning, Sessions defended himself and refused to discuss any details of conversations he has had with President Trump. In his opening statement, Sessions said: \"Let me state this clearly, colleagues: I have never met with or had any conversation with any Russians or foreign officials concerning any type of interference with any campaign or election in the United States. Further, I have no knowledge of any such conversations by anyone connected to the Trump campaign.\" The attorney general on March 2 recused himself from the FBI investigation into Russia's role in the election, saying he felt he was required to do so because he had been a prominent figure in Trump's campaign. \"Many have suggested that my recusal is because I felt I was a subject of the investigation myself, that I may have done something wrong,\" he said, stressing this was not the case. \"The suggestion that I participated in any collusion, that I was aware of any collusion with the Russian government, or hurt this country which I have served with honor for 35 years, or to undermine the integrity of our democratic process, is an appalling and detestable lie,\" Sessions said. His testimony came just six days after James Comey, the fired FBI director, appeared before the same committee. Comey discussed a host of issues surrounding Russia's meddling in the 2016 presidential election, though his remarks also raised questions that were directed at Sessions on Tuesday. Comey referred frequently to the attorney general and included the tantalizing tidbit that there were \"facts that I can't discuss in an open setting.\" Sessions requested an open hearing, though he made clear in his opening remarks and several times during his testimony that there were some things he would not discuss, including confidential conversations with the president. Democratic senators expressed frustration with Sessions on several occasions. In one tense exchange, Ron Wyden, D-Ore., said, \"I believe the American people have had it with stonewalling. Americans don't want to hear that answers to relevant questions are privileged or off limits.\" \"I am not stonewalling,\" Sessions said. \"I am following the historic policies of the Department of Justice\" on private discussions with the White House. Mark Warner, the Virginia Democrat and vice chairman of the committee, raised his concerns in his opening statement: \"Our committee will want to hear what you are doing to ensure that the Russians \u2014 or any other foreign adversaries \u2014 cannot attack our democratic process like this ever again. I am concerned that the president still does not recognize the severity of the threat. He does not acknowledge the unanimous conclusions of the U.S. intelligence community that Russia massively intervened in our election.\" Before he became attorney general, Sessions served two decades as a Republican senator from Alabama. But his former Democratic colleagues pressed him repeatedly on his contacts with Russia and his role in the dismissal of Comey \u2014 who led the FBI's probe on Russia until he was ousted. The attorney general has acknowledged two meetings last year with Russia's ambassador to the U.S., Sergey Kislyak. But he denied reports that he had a third, previously undisclosed meeting with Kislyak at the Mayflower Hotel in Washington in April 2016. \"I did not have any private meetings, nor do I recall any conversations with any Russian officials at the Mayflower Hotel,\" said Sessions. He was asked about the event several times, and said at one point, \"If any brief interaction occurred in passing with the Russian ambassador during that reception, I do not remember it.\" In his testimony last week, Comey said he and Trump had a one-on-one meeting in the Oval Office on Feb. 14 about the investigation into the former national security adviser, Michael Flynn. According to Comey, Trump said of Flynn: \"He is a good guy. I hope you can let this go.\" After that meeting, Comey said, he told Sessions he did not want to be left alone with Trump, because he didn't think it was appropriate for the president and the FBI director to have such private meetings. The FBI is part of the Justice Department that Sessions heads. Sessions confirmed Comey's account, but he placed less emphasis on the Trump-Comey meeting. \"I believe it was the next day that [Comey] said something, expressed concern, about being left alone with the president,\" Sessions said. \"But that in itself is not problematic. He did not, at that time, tell me any details about anything that was said that was improper. I affirmed his concern that we should be following the proper guidelines of the Department of Justice, and basically backed him up in his concerns.\" Earlier, Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., asked Sessions why, after recusing himself from the Russia inquiry, he signed a letter last month recommending that President Trump fire Comey. Sessions said he agreed with a letter drafted by his deputy, Rod Rosenstein, that Comey should be replaced. Sessions added his own letter to that effect, and both documents were sent to Trump, who then fired Comey later on the same day, May 9. However, Sessions refused to say whether he ever spoke with Trump about firing Comey.",

Updated at 3:35 p.m ET President Trump's outside lawyer flatly denied that the president ever asked former FBI Director James Comey for a pledge of loyalty, and he accused Comey of disclosing privileged communications with the president to the news media, without authorization. Trump's attorney, Marc Kasowitz, went on the offensive only a couple of hours after Comey concluded his testimony before the Senate Intelligence Committee \u2014 a highly anticipated performance that was broadcast live on national television. Kasowitz highlighted Comey's most favorable point for the president: that Trump was not personally the target of an FBI investigation. But he challenged Comey's account of a private dinner he had with the president on Jan. 27, during Trump's first full week in the White House. The president \"never told Comey, 'I need loyalty, I expect loyalty,' in form or substance,\" Kasowitz said in a statement, rebutting Comey's testimony that Trump appeared to be trying to create a patronage relationship with the FBI director. Comey said he was so concerned by the dinner, and the perceived threat to the FBI's independence, that he documented that and other meetings with the president in personal memos. After he was fired, Comey asked a friend to leak the contents of a memo about an Oval Office meeting that he had with Trump to a newspaper reporter. \"Comey's excuse for this unauthorized disclosure of privileged information ... appears to be entirely retaliatory,\" Kasowitz said in the statement. \"We will leave it [to] the appropriate authorities to determine whether this leaks [sic] should be investigated along with all those others being investigated.\" The lawyer also accused Comey of misstating the timing of the leak. \"Although Mr. Comey testified he only leaked the memos in response to a tweet, the public record reveals that the New York Times was quoting from these memos the day before the referenced tweet.\" In fact, Comey's timeline appears to be correct. Trump tweeted on Friday, May 12, that \"James Comey better hope that there are no 'tapes' of our conversation before he starts leaking to the press.\" James Comey better hope that there are no \"tapes\" of our conversations before he starts leaking to the press! Comey said it was that tweet that prompted him to ask a friend to reveal the contents of the memo to a reporter the following Tuesday, May 16. The Times ran a story about the memo contents later that day. Although the Times also reported on May 11 \u2014 before Trump's tweet \u2014 about Comey's private dinner with the president, that story made no reference to Comey's contemporaneous memos. New York Times reporters corroborated Comey's timeline on Thursday after Kasowitz's statement. The president himself was uncharacteristically restrained during the Comey hearing. Trump didn't send out a single tweet. Trump's elder son was active on Twitter, however, defending his dad. Donald Trump Jr. took particular aim at Comey's claim that by saying, \"I hope you can see your way clear to letting this go,\" the president was effectively directing the FBI director to close the investigation of former national security adviser Michael Flynn. \"Hoping and telling are two very different things,\" the younger Trump tweeted. \"Knowing my father for 39 years, when he 'orders or tells' you to do something there is no ambiguity, you will know exactly what he means.\" 3/3 Knowing my father for 39 years when he \"orders or tells\" you to do something  there is no ambiguity, you will know exactly what he means Administration spokeswoman Sarah Huckabee Sanders tried to project an air of normalcy, telling reporters, \"It's a regular Thursday at the White House.\" She said the president spent much of the morning in meetings with his national security team, although a person close to his legal team said Trump planned to watch at least part of the Comey hearing with his attorney. Sanders declined to answer specific questions about Comey's testimony, referring those to the president's lawyer. She did take issue, though, with Comey's claim that Trump is less than honest. \"I can definitely say the president is not a liar,\" Sanders said. \"And I think it's frankly insulting that that question would be asked.\" Comey accused Trump of lying in multiple instances in the hearing. Trump later addressed the Faith and Freedom Coalition, a group of religious conservatives who have been supportive of the president. He made no direct reference to the Comey hearing in his speech, though he did liken himself to people of faith who feel persecuted by the government. \"As you know, we're under siege,\" Trump said, promising to protect religious liberty. \"You understand that. But we will come out bigger and better and stronger than ever.\" Republican House Speaker Paul Ryan defended the president's contacts with Comey, saying any breach of the usual firewalls was a product of inexperience, not nefarious intent. \"Of course there needs to be a degree of independence\" between the FBI and the White House, Ryan said. \"The president is new at this. He's new to government. So he probably wasn't steeped in the long-running protocols that establish the relationships.\" During the hearing, Comey offered a different take. \"Why did he kick everybody out of the Oval Office\" before raising the Flynn investigation, if the president's intent was innocent? Comey asked. \"That, to me, as an investigator, is a very significant fact.\"",

            "article_content": "Credit:  U.S. Capitol Updated at 5:06 p.m. ET Former FBI Director James Comey told the Senate Intelligence Committee that he believed he was fired by President Trump over the growing Russia investigation and that other arguments by the White House were \"lies, plain and simple.\" In bombshell testimony Thursday, Comey, who was abruptly let go a month ago, said he began documenting his numerous, and often uncomfortable, conversations with Trump \u2014 in which the president asked for his \"loyalty\" and for him to scuttle the FBI's investigation into former Trump national security adviser Michael Flynn \u2014 because he \"was honestly concerned (Trump) might lie\" about their meetings. \"I knew there might come a day when I might need a record of what happened not just to defend myself\" but also the FBI, Comey added. \"My impression is something big is about to happen. I need to remember every word that is spoken,\" he said of the memos he wrote immediately after his encounters with the president. White House deputy press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders later pushed back on Comey's assertions, telling reporters that \"I can definitely say the president is not a liar and I think it's frankly insulting\" that the question was asked. \"Shifting explanations\" for Comey's firing The former FBI director also zeroed in on Trump's evolving explanations for why he had been let go, saying he was \"confused\" and \"increasingly concerned\" about the \"shifting explanations\" Trump gave. The president initially pointed to Comey's handling of the Hillary Clinton email investigation as the impetus but later conceded the firing was because of his handling of the Russia investigation and claimed Comey was overseeing a demoralized FBI in disarray. \"So it confused me when I saw on television the president saying he actually fired me because of the Russia investigation and learned again from the media that he was telling, privately, other parties that my firing had relieved 'great pressure' on the Russia investigation,\" Comey said, referring to reporting on Trump's conversation with Russian officials in the Oval Office the day after the dismissal. \"The administration then chose to defame me and, more importantly, the FBI,\" Comey said, by claiming the agency was \"poorly led.\" \"Those were lies, plain and simple,\" Comey bluntly told the committee. Awkward \"loyalty\" dinners and Oval Office pressure Comey's highly anticipated testimony followed the release by the committee of his written statement on Wednesday, which ticked off in rich detail the extent to which Trump pressed him about the Russia investigation. Comey wrote that Trump asked him for a \"loyalty\" pledge during a one-on-one dinner and later told Comey in a solo Oval Office meeting that he \"hope[d] you can let ... go\" of the Flynn investigation. The president has denied both those accusations. But Comey's testimony only confirmed the many bombshell reports over the past few weeks about the private conversations he had with Trump, many of them unprecedented and possibly inappropriate. Comey told the committee that he did see Trump's request for loyalty from him \u2014 an independent arbiter atop the FBI \u2014 as a sort of quid pro quo. \"My common sense told me what's going on here is he's looking to get something in exchange for granting my request to stay in the job,\" Comey said. He also said that in a now-infamous photo just days after Trump's inauguration in which the president shook his hand and embraced him, Trump whispered in his ear, \"I really look forward to working with you.\" President Trump shakes hands with James Comey, then director of the FBI, during an Inaugural Law Enforcement Officers and First Responders Reception at the White House in January.\n                \n                    \n                    Andrew Harrer/Getty Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption On Trump's Feb. 14 private conversation with Comey in the Oval Office \u2014 the day after Flynn was asked to resign for misleading Vice President Pence over his conversations with the Russian ambassador during the transition \u2014 Comey said that he believed the president was indeed directing him to scuttle the investigation into Flynn. \"I took it as a direction,\" which he didn't follow, Comey said. \"I took it as, this is what he wants me to do.\" Comey also added that, at that time, Flynn was indeed in \"legal jeopardy\" over his ties and contacts with the Russians. He noted that Attorney General Jeff Sessions tried to linger in on that meeting, and he said that it was his \"sense\" that Sessions \"knew he shouldn't be leaving.\" According to Comey's written testimony, he later told Sessions he didn't want to be left alone with Trump again. Comey said during questioning that he was \"stunned\" by that conversation and the president asking everyone else to leave and later said it was a \"significant fact\" to him as a prosecutor that Trump wanted to speak with him alone. Obstruction of justice? Up to special counsel Mueller to \"sort that out\" Comey did testify that he didn't believe Trump was asking Comey to stop the broader Russia investigation being conducted by the FBI and that while his conversation with Trump was \"disturbing,\" he didn't \"think it's for me to say that the conversation I had with the president was an effort to obstruct.\" Later asked by Sen. Joe Manchin, D-W.Va., whether Trump's interactions with him over Flynn rose to the level of obstruction of justice, Comey responded that was newly appointed special counsel Robert Mueller's \"job to sort that out.\" Comey said he had seen Trump's tweet last month suggesting that the president had \"tapes\" of their conversations \u2014 and that if those did exist, they would corroborate his testimony. \"Lordy, I hope there are tapes,\" he told senators. And, Comey revealed, it was Trump's tweet about those alleged tapes that prompted him to call up a friend to leak the memos about his conversations with the president to the press last month in hopes that doing so would lead to the appointment of a special counsel to oversee the Russia investigation. Republicans have already seized on one section of Comey's written testimony as vindication. The former FBI director does detail in his written submission to the committee how he told Trump on three occasions that the president was not himself under investigation \u2014 a surprising assertion that Trump had put in his termination letter to Comey. Comey told the committee that deliberations with senior FBI leadership about whether to tell the president he was not personally under investigation beginning in January, before he was inaugurated, were not unanimous. \"One of the members of the leadership team had a view that although it was technically true, we did not have a counterintelligence file case open on then-President-elect Trump, his concern was that because we're looking at the potential \u2014 again that's the subject of the investigation \u2014 coordination between the campaign and Russia, because it was President Trump \u2014 President-elect Trump's campaign, this person's view was inevitably his behavior, his conduct will fall within the scope of that work. And so he was reluctant to make the statement that I made. I disagreed,\" Comey said. \"I thought it was fair to say what was literally true \u2014 there is not a counterintelligence investigation of Mr. Trump \u2014 and I decided in the moment to say it given the nature of our conversation.\" He later confirmed that when he was let go on May 9, there was no counterintelligence nor criminal investigation of Trump individually and that the president was not personally under investigation. Asked by Sen. Tom Cotton, R-Ark., as to whether he believed Trump colluded with Russia during the campaign, Comey responded, \"I don't think I should answer in an open setting.\" Following his open hearing with members of the intelligence committee, Comey went into a closed briefing with senators. Comey did underscore that while there was plenty of evidence that Russians meddled in the 2016 election, he was confident that no votes were altered. However, he also said Trump never asked him what the FBI was doing to investigate the Russian meddling or to stop it from happening again in future elections. Comey said he fully expected Russian mischief in U.S. elections to resume in subsequent electoral cycles. Comey was also pressed by Republicans on the committee, including Florida Sen. Marco Rubio, about why he didn't alert White House officials or the White House Counsel's Office about what he believed were inappropriate conversations with Trump and a breach of protocol. \"I don't know,\" Comey responded to Rubio. \"I think the circumstances were such that I was a bit stunned and didn't have the presence of mind.\" Comey critical of Obama Attorney General Loretta Lynch Republicans also pressed Comey on how he handled the investigation into Hillary Clinton's emails during the 2016 campaign, usurping then-Attorney General Loretta Lynch by announcing the FBI was not recommending prosecution for the handling of classified information on Clinton's private server. Comey testified he was disturbed by Lynch's tarmac meeting with Clinton's husband, former President Bill Clinton, and that was one reason he made his announcement in July, though he did say at that time he believed Hillary Clinton had been careless with classified information. \"I didn't believe she could credibly decline that investigation, at least not without grievous damage to the Department of Justice and the FBI,\" Comey said of President Barack Obama's attorney general. Comey said it made him uncomfortable that Lynch had directed him to refer to the Clinton email investigation as a \"matter\" and not an investigation, even though she was, indeed, under criminal investigation. Pressed by Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., as to why he didn't call for an independent counsel to handle that matter, Comey said that he \"knew there was no case there\" and that \"calling for a special counsel would be brutally unfair.\" Republicans push back that Trump has been \"vindicated\" The president did not immediately respond directly to Comey's testimony and has not tweeted, as many people speculated he might. However, the president's son Donald Trump Jr. did largely live-tweet the event. 1/3 Flynn stuff is BS in context 2 guys talking about a guy they both know well. I hear \"I hope nothing happens but you have to do your job\" 2/3 very far from any kind of coercion or influence and certainly not obstruction! 3/3 Knowing my father for 39 years when he \"orders or tells\" you to do something  there is no ambiguity, you will know exactly what he means Hoping and telling are two very different things, you would think that a guy like Comey would know that. #givemeabreak And Marc Kasowitz, President Trump's personal lawyer regarding the Russia inquiries, underscored in a statement that Comey did confirm what Trump has long asserted \u2014 that the former FBI director assured the president he was not under investigation. \"[Comey] also admitted that there is no evidence that a single vote changed as a result of any Russian interference. Mr. Comey's testimony also makes clear that the President never sought to impede the investigation into attempted Russian interference in the 2016 election, and in fact, according to Mr. Comey, the President told Mr. Comey 'it would be good to find out' in that investigation if there were 'some \"satellite\" associates of his who did something wrong.' And he did not exclude anyone from that statement,\" Kasowitz said. Kasowitz also claimed that Trump never told Comey he needed loyalty from him \"in any form or substance,\" even though the president \"is entitled to expect loyalty from those who are serving in an administration.\" And he raised alarm over Comey's admission that he had encouraged a friend to leak his memos about his conversations with the president to the press, suggesting those were privileged communications. \"We will leave it the appropriate authorities to determine whether this leaks should be investigated along with all those others being investigated,\" Kasowitz said. Meanwhile, House Speaker Paul Ryan defended Trump at his weekly press conference, arguing that one reason the president had unusual conversations with Comey was because he was a novice president learning the ropes. \"Of course there needs to be a degree of independence between DOJ, FBI and the White House and a line of communications established. The president is new at this. He's new to government. So he probably wasn't steeped in the long-running protocols that establish the relationships between DOJ, FBI and White Houses,\" Ryan said. \"He's just new to this.\" Ryan was pushed by a reporter who asked how being new is an acceptable excuse when he has staff and legal counsel. \"I'm not saying it's an acceptable excuse, it's just my observation,\" the Wisconsin Republican replied. \"I think people now realize why the president is so frustrated,\" Ryan added. \"When the FBI director tells him on three different occasions he's not under investigation yet the speculation swirls around the political system that he is, that's frustrating. Of course the president is frustrated, and I think the American people now know why he was so frustrated.\" NPR's Susan Davis contributed to this report.",

Updated at 10:05 a.m. ET President Trump is set to host the Super Bowl champion New England Patriots at the White House on Wednesday, an event that brings together some of the most polarizing figures in both sports and politics. The Patriots are well-acquainted with this championship ritual, having won five Super Bowls in the last sixteen years. But their come-from-behind win over the Atlanta Falcons \u2014 after being down 25 points \u2014 was every bit as unlikely as Trump's own upset victory three months earlier. The president himself left a watch party at his Florida golf club during the Super Bowl, after New England fell behind 28-3. He was as surprised as anyone by the turnaround that followed. \"What an amazing comeback and win by the Patriots,\" Trump tweeted. \"Tom Brady, Bob Kraft and Coach B are total winners. Wow!\" What an amazing comeback and win by the Patriots. Tom Brady, Bob Kraft and Coach B are total winners. Wow! Trump is a longtime friend of the Patriots' quarterback, owner and head coach, so there will be plenty of smiles when they pose for commemorative photos at the White House. At least a half dozen team members are boycotting the event, though, with some saying they don't feel welcome so long as Trump is president. The White House has indicated that the event is going forward, in light of the death of former Patriots player Aaron Hernandez in prison. Corrections officials say Hernandez, who was serving a life sentence after being convicted of a 2013 murder, committed suicide. Brady said he cannot attend today's ceremony due to a family matter he needs to attend to, according to a statement obtained by ESPN. He skipped a White House visit in 2015 \u2014 the team's only win during the Obama presidency. The quarterback did celebrate three earlier victories with George W. Bush, though. And he visited the Clinton White House as a college player after the University of Michigan split the national championship in 1997 with the University of Nebraska. \"It really is a great experience,\" Brady said, according to the Boston Globe. \"Putting politics aside, it never was a political thing. At least, it never was to me.\" Some of Brady's teammates don't share that view. \"I'm not going to the White House,\" defensive back Devin McCourty told Time Magazine. \"Basic reason for me is I don't feel accepted in the White House. With the president having so many strong opinions and prejudices, I believe certain people might feel accepted there while others won't.\" Defensive end Chris Long, running back LeGarrette Blount, linebacker Dont'a Hightower, defensive tackle Alan Branch, and tight end Martellus Bennett also planned to skip the celebration with Trump, according to Bleacher Report. Team owner Kraft says players are free to make their own decision. \"This is America,\" Kraft said on NBC's Today show. \"We're all free to do whatever's best for us. We're just privileged to be in a position to be going.\" The ties between Trump and the Patriots organization are deep, although head coach Bill Belichick says they have nothing to do with politics. \"Anybody that has spent more than five minutes with me knows I'm not a political person,\" Belichick told reporters, days before the Super Bowl. Trump did quote Belichick on the eve of last year's election, though. At a political rally in New Hampshire, Trump read aloud from a letter the Patriots coach had written him. \"You've proved to be the ultimate competitor and fighter,\" Trump said, quoting Belichick. \"The toughness and perseverance you have displayed over the past year is remarkable. Hopefully tomorrow's election results will give the opportunity to make America great again.\" The Patriots showed their own remarkable toughness and perseverance in the Super Bowl, overcoming a 25-point deficit to win in overtime, 34-28.",

Updated at 5:24 p.m. ET Opponents of special counsel Robert Mueller ramped up their attacks over the weekend with a new claim that he improperly collected thousands of emails from President Trump's transition team and is using them as an illegitimate basis for much of his investigation. Mueller's office said his team has obtained all the evidence it's using in its investigation properly. And Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, who appointed him, told Congress last week that he monitors Mueller's operation closely and has seen nothing improper. This weekend's dispute is the latest chapter in an ongoing campaign by Trump's Republican allies against Mueller and his team. Upon his return to the White House from an overnight trip to Camp David, the president weighed in on the controversy surrounding his transition team's emails, telling reporters, \"It's not looking good.\" Trump added: \"It's quite sad to see. My people were very upset about it. I can't imagine there's anything on [the emails] quite frankly, because as we said there's no collusion, no collusion whatsoever.\" He also told reporters he has no plans to fire Mueller. The anti-Mueller camp raised the stakes on Saturday by charging that Mueller had improperly obtained tens of thousands of emails from as many as a dozen accounts associated with the Trump transition, and investigators had been using information they contained in their investigation. At issue is how the special counsel obtained the materials. The emails were stored with General Services Administration, a government agency that does a range of things like providing office space for federal employees. It also hosted the incoming administration's email system, which ended in \"@ptt.gov\" \u2014 or presidential transition team. The special counsel reportedly got the email trove from the GSA, not from Trump For America, a still-functioning arm of Trump's transition team. The special counsel's office pushed back on the characterizations that the emails were obtained unlawfully. In a statement Sunday, spokesperson Peter Carr said: \"When we have obtained emails in the course of our ongoing criminal investigation, we have secured either the account owner's consent or appropriate criminal process.\" But a lawyer for the Trump transition on Saturday sent a letter to two congressional committees arguing that the materials were acquired in a way that was \"unlawful.\" According to Axios, which broke the story Saturday, the transition emails contain \"sensitive exchanges\" on topics ranging from policy planning, potential appointments and views on senators who would be involved with confirming political appointees. Also on Saturday, Kory Langhofer, a general counsel for Trump For America, sent a letter to chairs of the Senate Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs and the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform. In the letter, obtained by Politico, Langhofer calls the emails \"private, privileged materials,\" not government property, and informs the committees of what he described as \"unlawful conduct that undermines the Presidential Transition Act of 1963.\" Langhofer went on to say: \"The Special Counsel's Office has extensively used the materials in question, including portions that are susceptible to claims of privilege, and without notifying TFA or taking customary precautions to protect TFA's rights and privileges.\" Langhofer also asserts in the letter sent to the chairs of the congressional committees that \"TFA owned and controlled the PTT emails and data\" adding that \"GSA had no right to access or control the records but was simply serving as TFA's records custodian.\" A lawyer for TFA, who spoke on background because he was not authorized to speak to media, told NPR it found out on Dec. 13 that GSA officials turned over the emails to the special counsel in September. The lawyer added that TFA had a \"reasonable expectation of privacy in those emails\" and claims that in order for the special counsel to have received the materials it would have needed a warrant or a subpoena. Complicating matters is that Langhofer said in the memo that there was an understanding that TFA was the custodian of the emails. He said the agreement was laid out in June before a lawyer at GSA, Richard Beckler, a Trump appointee, who has since died. This dispute over the lawful obtaining of this batch of emails is the latest in a series of ongoing attacks, particularly from conservatives, on the Department of Justice investigation looking into what role Russia played in interfering in the 2016 presidential election. As NPR's Carrie Johnson points out: \"GOP voices are accusing the team assembled by special counsel Robert Mueller of bias against President Trump \u2014 and they're appearing to set the stage for some action. Senior Justice Department officials are defending the investigation, which has already secured indictments or guilty pleas against four people with ties to the Trump campaign.\" There are rumors around Washington suggesting Trump's firing of Mueller is imminent. But White House special counsel Ty Cobb told NPR's Tamara Keith that's not the case. He said: \"As the WH has persistently said for months, there is no consideration being given to firing the Special Counsel with whom we continue to cooperate with the expectation of an appropriate and timely result.\" During a House Judiciary Committee hearing last week, Republicans slammed the special counsel's office over what they said was the Democratic-leaning bias of some of its key lawyers and investigators. At that hearing, Rosenstein, the Justice Department official who oversees Mueller's investigation, told lawmakers he is aware of how Mueller is carrying out the probe and he saw no reason to terminate him. \"I know what he's doing,\" Rosenstein said. \"If I felt he was doing something inappropriate, I would take action.\" As it stands, Mueller's team has secured indictments against Trump's former campaign chairman Paul Manafort and Manafort's business associate Rick Gates. Mueller's team has also gotten guilty pleas from Trump's first national security adviser and campaign adviser Michael Flynn and George Papdopolous, a foreign policy adviser to Trump during the campaign. Both men pleaded guilty to lying to FBI agents.",

This week In the Russia investigations: Downshift from strategic war to knife fight, top G-Men on his back foot as lawmakers engage in oversight, Trump Jr. clammed up in Congress. Now, a knife fight Not long ago, this saga was about Justice Department special counsel Robert Mueller's surveying the battlefield like a general and with one swift coup \u2014 getting Michael Flynn to turn state's evidence \u2014 changing the whole strategic picture. Then came a strange chain of events resulting in a key concession by the White House \u2014 that President Trump knew in real time that Flynn had likely lied to the FBI \u2014 that further altered the battle space in a fundamental way. This week, however, the imbroglio was more like a knife fight inside a telephone booth. House Republicans slashed Mueller after revelations that he reassigned a top FBI investigator who sent anti-Trump text messages to a colleague. Mueller's office slashed former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort \u2014 revealing his collaboration with someone it said has ties to Russian intelligence. Trump helped the metaphor when he complained about the abilities of the FBI and said its reputation was in \"Tatters \u2014 worst in History!\" The bureau's new director, Christopher Wray, tried to defend himself and his agents in Congress. Meanwhile, Trump's son Donald Trump Jr. irked House Intelligence Committee members by appearing once more \u2014 but not talking. Above all, it became clear how swiftly the never-ending Russia imbroglio can shift from a big, sweeping phase into intense tactical skirmishing. Trump Jr. gives Hill the Heisman The president's eldest son declined to tell House Intelligence Committee members about a discussion he had with his father about the much-discussed meeting in Trump Tower last year with a Russian delegation. Because lawyers were in the mix \u2014 present for the discussion or otherwise involved, according to subsequent accounts \u2014 Trump Jr. said his conversation with the president was protected by attorney-client privilege, as Manu Raju and Jeremy Herb report for CNN. That is not how that works, complained the panel's top Democrat, Rep. Adam. Schiff of California. \"I don't believe you can shield communications between individuals merely by having an attorney present,\" Schiff said, according to Politico. But that is the response Trump Jr. gave and the House Intelligence Committee did not try to compel him to say more \u2014 plus the Republican leader of the panel's Russia investigation, Texas Rep. Mike Conaway, didn't object to Trump Jr.'s answer or lack thereof. It isn't clear whether Trump Jr. has given the same response to Mueller's team or would attempt it if he were asked. Tough day for Wray The nation's top G-Man has not been a 10th as visible as James Comey was. He is stuck in the unenviable place of serving as the hand-picked choice of a president whose camp is being investigated by the bureau's special agents. And he seems to generally have much less of a taste for the limelight than did the 6-foot-8-inch Comey, who is also now a regular Twitter and Instagram commentator. So when Trump slammed the FBI, Wray at first said nothing. Then he circulated an internal message with an attaboy for the bureau that its public affairs staff would not give reporters \u2014 except for the obligatory copy leaked to The New York Times. When Wray walked into the House Judiciary Committee for an oversight hearing on Thursday, he was on his back foot. \"Reports on the bias of some of the career agents and lawyers on current special counsel Mueller's team are also deeply troubling to a system of blind and equal justice,\" said committee Chairman Bob Goodlatte, R-Va. \"Said investigations must not be tainted by individuals imposing their own personal political opinions.\" Wray defended the FBI and the special counsel's office. He referred several times to the ongoing probe by the Justice Department's inspector general into how the FBI conducted its investigation of the Clinton private email server. And he gave no ground to demands by Republicans for at least one more special counsel to look into everything that has taken place over the past nearly two years, as NPR's Miles Parks reports. FBI Director Christopher Wray defended the FBI and the special counsel's office before the House Judiciary Committee on Thursday.\n                \n                    \n                    Win McNamee/Getty Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption FBI Director Christopher Wray defended the FBI and the special counsel's office before the House Judiciary Committee on Thursday. The matter is not settled, however, and as Devlin Barrett and Sean Sullivan wrote in The Washington Post, Trump's allies are expected to keep up \"a multi-front attack\" on Mueller and the FBI. Mueller's jujitsu Manafort had a plan to try to burnish his image in the public square, but Mueller's office flipped that on its back. Prosecutors used a court filing for U.S. District Court Judge Amy Berman Jackson to not only withdraw their support for a bail agreement they had negotiated with Manafort's lawyer, but also to complain that Manafort planned to violate Berman Jackson's gag order with an op-ed column on his own behalf. And, oh, by the way, Manafort's putative co-author on the column is a Russian with ties to the Kremlin's intelligence services, Mueller's office said. A person close to Manafort, who asked not to be identified, told NPR's Ryan Lucas that Manafort didn't lose his First Amendment rights just because he had been indicted. Attorneys in the case were, however, instructed not to talk about it publicly, the government complained. Mueller's team might have more in store for Manafort and his former business partner, Rick Gates. An attorney for Gates said this week that he couldn't be sure more charges are not coming; the two men are due back in federal court in D.C. on Monday. Flynn told contact Russia sanctions would be \"ripped up,\" per House Dem Then-national security adviser Flynn texted a onetime business partner gleefully on Inauguration Day and said sanctions against Russia would be \"ripped up\" early in the new Trump administration. That is according to Maryland Rep. Elijah Cummings, the top Democrat on the House Oversight Committee, who cited the account of an anonymous whistleblower. Meaning what? Flynn and the Trump camp may have already decided by the time Trump took his oath of office not only that they would reset with Russia \u2014 which had just attacked the 2016 presidential election \u2014 but also to eliminate the whole sanctions regime then in force. There appear to have been many reasons; one, according to Cummings, was Flynn's business relationship with people who needed those sanctions to go away in order to move ahead with a big potential nuclear power deal in the Middle East. Mueller's team may uncover others. Reports: Mueller subpoenaed Trump bank records. White House: No he didn't Mueller's office has issued a subpoena for Trump records to German finance giant Deutsche Bank, according to several press reports that quoted bank officials and U.S. officials. No it hasn't, Trump attorneys and the White House said. Deutsche Bank has made no comment beyond telling a German newspaper that it cooperates with all official inquiries. Meaning what? If Mueller has subpoenaed the bank \u2014 or asked it for information under some other guise about the Trump family \u2014 that could suggest a major new direction in his inquiry. Trump owes Deutsche Bank at least $130 million, according to recent financial disclosures, and possibly a great deal more. U.S. officials told Reuters that they want to know whether Deutsche Bank has sold any of the debt instruments it owns of Trump's to Russia's state-controlled VEB or other Russian banks. Trump and his aides have said they think the president's business dealings should be off limits for the Mueller squad.",

That includes a large percentage of whites without a college degree.\n                \n                    \n                    Saul Loeb/AFP/Getty Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption When his back is against the wall, President Trump goes back to where he derives energy \u2014 his base. That includes a large percentage of whites without a college degree. Donald Trump won the votes of whites without a college degree by a bigger margin than any Republican presidential candidate since 1980. And there is reason for that. He gave voice to a group of people who have felt left behind. \"Every single American will have the opportunity to realize his or her fullest potential,\" Trump said in his election night victory speech, one year ago this week. \"The forgotten men and women of our country will be forgotten no longer.\" At nearly every rally and campaign event, populated largely by whites, Trump spoke to their cultural grievances \u2014 and he has continued to do so as president. But what has also been clear is that nonwhites, many of whom have felt like targets of Trump's nationalist and protectionist tendencies, are also aggrieved. A survey by NPR, the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation and the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health found that majorities across racial lines, including whites, said discrimination exists against their group. It does seem that in America today, it is something of a golden age of grievance. One year later It may be hard to believe, but this week marks one year since Trump was elected president of the United States. And it hasn't been the easiest go of it for the 45th president. As a candidate, Trump had the lowest favorability ratings of anyone ever elected since polling began. And since his ascendancy to the presidency, he has continued along a similar pattern \u2014 with the lowest job-approval rating of any president in modern polling. According to an average of the polls, Trump stands around 39 percent. That is about where he has been throughout his first 10 months in office. He peaked around 46 percent in early February, just after his inauguration, and he has never dipped below 37 percent, which he hit in mid-August. That was right around the time Trump faced widespread criticism for his response to racial violence and protests in Charlottesville, Va. All about that base It has been clear that when his back is against the wall, Trump goes back to where he derives energy \u2014 his base. For example: Again and again, Trump has criticized political correctness. \"We have to get much tougher,\" he said after the New York attack, echoing a line from the campaign trail. \"We're so politically correct that we're afraid to do anything.\" His base is holding mostly firm. There is some evidence of a softening of support but not enough that shows his people abandoning him. Art of the deal? Rhetorically, Trump certainly hasn't abandoned his base, but what about on policy? The next lines of that election night speech, after noting the forgotten men and women were these: \"We are going to fix our inner cities and rebuild our highways, bridges, tunnels, airports, schools, hospitals,\" Trump said. \"We're going to rebuild our infrastructure, which will become, by the way, second to none. And we will put millions of our people to work as we rebuild it.\" Despite that promise, an infrastructure bill hasn't even been introduced \u2014 or pushed by the White House, for that matter. What's more, Trump has so far gotten no major legislation through Congress \u2014 not a repeal and replace of the Affordable Care Act, not a tax overhaul. But he appears to have a long leash with his base, which is willing to blame others \u2014 Democrats, Republican leaders \u2014 but not the man they voted for for president who is trying to, in their view, \"drain the swamp.\" Part of that long leash could be because cultural grievance was more important to his victory than economic issues. The Atlantic, citing data from the Public Religion Research Institute, reached that conclusion in May: \"In the wake of Trump's surprise win, some journalists, scholars, and political strategists argued that economic anxiety drove these Americans to Trump. But new analysis of post-election survey data conducted by the Public Religion Research Institute and The Atlantic found something different: Evidence suggests financially troubled voters in the white working class were more likely to prefer Clinton over Trump. Besides partisan affiliation, it was cultural anxiety \u2014 feeling like a stranger in America, supporting the deportation of immigrants, and hesitating about educational investment \u2014 that best predicted support for Trump. \"This data adds to the public's mosaic-like understanding of the 2016 election. It suggests Trump's most powerful message, at least among some Americans, was about defending the country's putative culture.\" Why cultural grievance is so salient Look no further than the NPR poll \u2014 55 percent of whites said they believe discrimination exists against whites, generally. That is even though just 19 percent said they have personally experienced discrimination in applying for jobs. Even fewer whites said they have personally experienced discrimination when it comes to promotions, college acceptance, interactions with the police, or housing. Loading... There are major political divisions among whites. Three-quarters (74 percent) of white Republicans said discrimination exists against whites. But when it comes to Democrats, it's less than a third (28 percent). That is an almost 50-point gap. Loading... There are also big splits when it comes to how well-off financially a white person is. The more money a white person makes, the less he or she thinks discrimination against whites exists generally. In some cases, they are also less likely to say that they've personally experienced discrimination or that it happens often in their neighborhoods. Roughly two-thirds of whites without a college degree and whites who live in rural areas, however, believe discrimination against whites exists. And those whites are also more likely to say they've experienced that discrimination personally. And those are exactly the kind of people who are in Trump's base. Loading... That is very different from nonwhites Nonwhites believe discrimination exists against their groups by even wider margins than whites. (Of course, many would argue that nonwhites face real rather than perceived racism \u2014 as the numbers bear out.) Here is what nonwhites said about whether discrimination exists against their group: And much higher percentages of nonwhites say they have personally experienced discrimination. Loading... For example, a third of Latinos say they have experienced discrimination when it comes to applying for jobs, getting paid equally or looking for housing. The gap between whites and African-Americans is even larger. Half or more African-Americans said they have been discriminated against personally when applying for jobs, getting paid fairly and in interacting with police.",

A majority of whites say discrimination against them exists in America today, according to a poll released Tuesday from NPR, the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation and the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health. \"If you apply for a job, they seem to give the blacks the first crack at it,\" said 68-year-old Tim Hershman of Akron, Ohio, \"and, basically, you know, if you want any help from the government, if you're white, you don't get it. If you're black, you get it.\" More than half of whites \u2014 55 percent \u2014 surveyed say that, generally speaking, they believe there is discrimination against white people in America today. Hershman's view is similar to what was heard on the campaign trail at Trump rally after Trump rally. Donald Trump catered to white grievance during the 2016 presidential campaign and has done so as president as well. Notable, however, is that while a majority of whites in the poll say discrimination against them exists, a much smaller percentage say that they have actually experienced it. Also important to note is that 84 percent of whites believe discrimination exists against racial and ethnic minorities in America today. Loading... People from every racial or ethnic group surveyed said they believe theirs faces discrimination \u2014 from African-Americans and Latinos to Native Americans and Asian-Americans, as well as whites. The NPR, the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation and the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health survey sampled 3,453 adults in the U.S. from Jan. 26 to April 9. Of those, 902 were white. The responses from whites can be broken down into three categories. Those who: 1. Believe there is anti-white discrimination and say they have personally experienced it, 2. Say there is indeed anti-white discrimination but say they have never felt it themselves, and 3. Say there is no discrimination of whites in America White and discriminated against? Ask Hershman whether there is discrimination against whites, and he answered even before this reporter could finish the question \u2014 with an emphatic \"Absolutely.\" \"It's been going on for decades, and it's been getting worse for whites,\" Hershman contended, despite data showing whites continue to be better off financially and educationally than minority groups. Even though Hershman believes he has been a victim of anti-white discrimination, he wasn't able to provide a specific example. He describes losing out on a promotion \u2014 and a younger African-American being selected as one of the finalists for the job. But the position eventually went to a white applicant, who was also younger than Hershman. Discrimination exists, but never felt it Representing Category 2 is 50-year-old heavy equipment operator Tim Musick, who lives in Maryland, just outside Washington, D.C. He says anti-white discrimination is real, but he doesn't think he has ever really felt it personally. \"I think that you pretty much, because you're white, you're automatically thrown into that group as being a bigot and a racist and that somehow you perceive yourself as being more superior to everybody else, which is ridiculous,\" Musick said, speaking during his lunch break at a construction site. \"I'm just a man that happens to have been born white,\" Musick continued. He also makes it clear, however, that he is not comparing what happens to whites to the African-American experience. \"I don't know what it feels like to be a black man walking around in the streets, but I do know what it feels like to be pegged, because of how you look, and what people perceive just on sight,\" said Musick, who has the stocky build of a retired NFL lineman and a shaved head under his hard hat. Whites who don't believe they are discriminated against Now for the third category \u2014 those who scoff at the notion that whites face racial discrimination. That describes retired community college English teacher Betty Holton, of Elkton, Md. \"I don't see how we can be discriminated against when, when we have all the power,\" Holton said, chuckling in disbelief into her cellphone. \"Look at Congress. Look at the Senate. Look at government on every level. Look at the leadership in corporations. Look. Look anywhere.\" Holton asserts: \"The notion that whites are discriminated against just seems incredible to me.\" Perception based on income Income also seemed to affect individual responses to the question of discrimination. Lower- and moderate-income white Americans were more likely to say that whites are discriminated against \u2014 and to say they have felt it, either when applying for a job, raise or promotion or in the college-admissions process. \"We've long seen a partisan divide with Democrats more likely to say racial discrimination is that reason blacks can't get ahead, but that partisan divide is even bigger than it has been in the past,\" said Jocelyn Kiley, an associate director at Pew Research Center. \"That's a point where we do see that partisan divides over issues of race have really increased in recent years.\" What this could mean for electoral politics David Cohen, a political scientist at the University of Akron, said the finding that a majority of whites say whites are victims of discrimination fits right into one of the big narratives of the last presidential campaign. \"I think this does reinforce a lot of the resentment you saw in the 2016 election, especially among white, working-class voters lacking a college degree,\" said Cohen, who lives in northeastern Ohio, a traditionally Democratic stronghold full of white, working-class union members. Trump ran far better there, though, than Republicans typically do, as he easily won the battleground state of Ohio, 52 percent to 44 percent. But Cohen also adds that for all of the talk of Trump's message speaking directly to whites in the working class \u2014 white voters overall supported him in about the same numbers as they did for Mitt Romney four years earlier \u2014 58 percent for Trump, 59 percent for Romney. And though it's possible that Trump's message to disaffected whites did make a difference in the decisive battleground states of Michigan, Wisconsin and Pennsylvania, Cohen said the question remains: Did Trump create or significantly boost white resentment overall \u2014 or did he simply tap into a trend with deep roots and history? \"I'm not sure that he necessarily created this angst among white voters,\" Cohen said, \"but he certainly knew how to take advantage of it.\" And it's something Trump \u2014 as president \u2014 has only continued to tap into.",

            "article_content": "The partisan split in America is the highest it has been in two decades, with Republicans and Democrats holding vastly disparate views on race, immigration and the role of government, according to a new study from the Pew Research Center. Pew has been measuring attitudes on policy issues and political values going back to 1994, and its latest check-in finds \u2014 perhaps unsurprisingly \u2014 that Americans are more divided than ever. \"The fact that Republicans and Democrats differ on these fundamental issues is probably not a surprise, but the magnitude of the difference is striking, and particularly how the differences have grown in recent years and where they've grown,\" Carroll Doherty, Pew's director of political research and one of the authors of the study, told NPR. Pew asked more than 5,000 respondents this summer about 10 specific political issues \u2014 including government regulation and aid, same-sex marriage and environmental regulations \u2014 and found that, on average, there was a 36-point gap between Republicans and Democrats. That's a whopping 21-point increase since it began tracking those questions 23 years ago. Partisanship has risen markedly since 2004, the year President George W. Bush was re-elected, and has hit a new high. Two decades before, there was about a 15-point gap between Republicans and Democrats on these issues, but it wasn't that much more pronounced than differences in race or religion. Now, how you identify politically is \u2014 by far \u2014 the starkest divider of how Americans see certain issues. The widest two gaps were in views about race and government aid to the poor. Overall, 41 percent of Americans said that racial discrimination is the reason black people struggle to get ahead, which is the highest mark in the survey's history; 49 percent, however, still said that African-Americans who couldn't advance were responsible for their own situation. Loading... But broken down along party lines, there's a huge 50-point gap between the way Republicans and Democrats see the issue \u2014 almost two-thirds (64 percent) of Democrats think some African-Americans struggle to get ahead because of discrimination, while just 14 percent of Republicans think so. Back in 1994, 39 percent of Democrats thought the same thing \u2014 a 25-point uptick \u2014 while just a quarter (24 percent) of Republicans thought so, a 12-point drop in the two decades since. There's also a 47-point gap between Democrats who believe that government should do more to help the needy (71 percent) and Republicans who agree with that statement (just 24 percent). Democrats' belief that the government needs to do more to help is up from 58 percent in 1994. A minority of Republicans have held that belief, and even fewer do today than a decade ago. The percentage saying so has fallen 21 points since 2007. On immigration, there's also a wide chasm between the parties \u2014 84 percent of Democrats say immigrants have strengthened the country with their \"hard work and talents.\" That's a 52-point increase since 1994. But the percentage of Republicans saying immigrants help the country is half that (42 percent). A plurality of Republicans (44 percent) believe immigrants are a burden, but that 42 percent is actually higher than in 1994 for Republicans. There is evidence of a generational shift among Republicans on social issues, with more support among younger Republicans for immigration and same-sex marriage, for example. On immigration, 62 percent of Republicans under 30 said immigrants strengthen the country (20 points higher than the GOP overall). Just 31 percent of Republicans 65 and older believed the same thing. Majorities in both parties also now said that being gay should be accepted by society. But the margin is far wider among Democrats than Republicans \u2014 more than 4 in 5 (83 percent) Democrats said so, while just more than half (54 percent) of Republicans agreed. Because Democratic support has exploded, the gap between the two parties has actually gotten wider despite broader acceptance by people in both. On other issues, like environmental regulations (and whether they have hurt the economy) and use of the military versus noninterventionism, the parties have also moved in very different directions over the past two decades. As is the case with all the issues Pew tested, Doherty explained that with each party being pulled further into its corner, it has been harder for legislators in Washington to reach any type of middle-ground consensus. \"These gaps on these fundamental values are underlying some of the divisions you see between Democrats and Republicans in Congress when they debate specific issues,\" Doherty said. Loading... In other words, for as much as people seem to lament inertia in Washington, part of it is because of public opinion. Democrats and Republicans have worse views of each other than ever before The Pew study underscored a deep distaste for the \"other side,\" too \u2014 along with evidence of just how polarized society as a whole has become geographically and socially. Among both Republicans and Democrats, the share of very unfavorable opinions of the other party has more than doubled in the past 23 years. In 1994, just 16 percent of Democrats said they held very unfavorable opinions of the GOP. Two decades later, that number has practically tripled \u2014 to 44 percent. The numbers are almost identical in how Republicans view Democrats, too \u2014 17 percent in 1994 and now 45 percent. \"Partisans have long held unfavorable views of the other party, but negative opinions are now more widely held and intensely felt than in the past,\" the study notes. Additionally, both parties say they overwhelmingly associate with people who share their same political beliefs \u2014 67 percent of Democrats say a lot of their close friends are also Democrats; 57 percent of Republicans say the same thing. Only 14 percent of Republicans say they have a lot of friends in the opposing party, while just 9 percent of Democrats do. Differences in where and how we live, too Two-thirds of Republicans in the survey also said they prefer communities where they can have more space, land and a bigger house, while 61 percent of Democrats want a community with smaller houses and walkable amenities. That tracks with recent trends of Republicans dominating in rural areas and Democrats struggling to make inroads there. Democrats, on the other hand, have strongholds in the cities and dense metropolitan areas. With gerrymandered House districts, that's made it easier for Republican-controlled legislatures to pack Democrats into fewer urban districts, making it increasingly necessary for Democrats to make gains in those more rural, conservative areas if they hope to gain significant seats in Congress. Studies like this highlight just how difficult that will be.",

            "article_content": "Protesters and LGBT activists rally outside Trump International Hotel this month in Washington, D.C.\n                \n                    \n                    Drew Angerer/Getty Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption Protesters and LGBT activists rally outside Trump International Hotel this month in Washington, D.C. The collision of two core American values \u2014 freedom of religion and freedom from discrimination \u2014 is prompting a showdown in legislatures and courts across the country. For some conservatives, religious freedom means the right to act on their opposition to same-sex marriage and other practices that go against their beliefs. LGBT advocates and their allies, meanwhile, say no one in the United States should face discrimination because of their sexual orientation. President Trump is said to be considering an executive order to bar the federal government from punishing people or institutions that support marriage exclusively as the union of one man and one woman. The language is similar to a bill expected to be reintroduced by Republican Sens. Ted Cruz of Texas and Mike Lee of Utah called the First Amendment Defense Act. After a widely circulated draft order aroused considerable opposition from the LGBT community, no further action was taken. Asked recently whether such an order might still get signed, White House spokesman Sean Spicer said only that Trump \"will continue to fulfill\" commitments he had made. Advocates for executive action say they do not expect new developments until Trump's nominee for the Supreme Court, Neil Gorsuch, has been confirmed. The debate's heart: What \"exercising\" one's religion means Under the First Amendment to the U.S. Constitution, Congress is barred from enacting \"an establishment of religion,\" but neither can it prohibit \"the free exercise thereof.\" The question under current debate is what it means to \"exercise\" one's religion. If a football coach is not allowed to lead his team in a public prayer, or a high school valedictorian is not given permission to read a Bible passage for her graduation speech, or the owner of a private chapel is told he cannot refuse to accommodate a same-sex wedding, they might claim their religious freedom has been infringed. Others might argue that such claims go against the principle of church-state separation, or that they undermine the rights of LGBT people to be free from discrimination. Legislation either to uphold LGBT rights or to limit them in the name of protecting religious freedom has advanced in several states, and further court battles are likely. One of the thorniest cases involves Catholic Charities, whose agencies long have provided adoption and foster care services to children in need, including orphans. Under Catholic doctrine, the sacrament of marriage is defined as the union of a man and a woman, and Catholic adoption agencies therefore have declined to place children with same-sex couples. When Massachusetts (and other jurisdictions) redefined marriage to include same-sex couples, making it illegal to deny adoption to them., the Catholic agencies closed down their adoption services and argued that their religious freedom had been infringed. \"One of the major activities of the [Catholic] church, going way back, was to look after the orphans,\" says Stanley Carlson-Thies, founder of the Institutional Religious Freedom Alliance. \"For that to be illegal unless the religious people change their standard, seems to me ... unfortunate.\" But to the LGBT community and its supporters, a refusal to place a child for adoption with a same-sex couple is unacceptable discrimination against people on the basis of their sexual orientation. Those who oppose anti-discrimination efforts are often portrayed as out of step with the growing public acceptance of same-sex unions. \"I can't think of a single civil rights law that doesn't have some people who are unhappy about it,\" says Karen Narasaki, a member of the U.S. Commission on Civil Rights. \"But once the country has said, 'Well, we believe that people who are LGBT need to be protected from discrimination,' then how do you make sure that happens?\" The commission's report on the religious freedom vs. anti-discrimination debate, published last September, came down squarely on the anti-discrimination side. The commission recommended that \"civil rights protections ensuring nondiscrimination\" were of \"preeminent\" importance and that religious exemptions to such policies \"must be weighed carefully and defined narrowly on a fact-specific basis.\" When you have two important American principles coming into conflict with one another, our goal as Americans is to sit down and try to see if we can uphold both. Charles Haynes of the Newseum's Religious Freedom Center The commission chairman at the time, Martin R. Castro, went further with a statement of his own, saying, \"The phrases 'religious liberty' and 'religious freedom' will stand for nothing except hypocrisy so long as they remain code words for discrimination, intolerance, racism, sexism, homophobia, Islamophobia, Christian supremacy or any form of intolerance.\" The commission report sparked a protest letter signed by 17 faith leaders, arguing that the report \"stigmatizes tens of millions of religious Americans, their communities and their faith-based institutions, and threatens the religious freedom of all our citizens.\" One of the signers, Charles Haynes, director of the Religious Freedom Center at the Newseum Institute in Washington, says religious conservatives are entitled to make claims of conscience. \"We may not like the claim of conscience,\" Haynes says, \"but you know, we don't judge claims of conscience on whether we like the content of the claim. We are trying to protect the right of people to do what they feel they must do according to their God. That is a very high value.\" Haynes himself says LGBT rights and same-sex marriage \"are very important\" but that supporters of those causes \"cannot simply declare that one side wins all.\" \"Nondiscrimination is a great American principle \u2014 it's a core American principle \u2014 as is religious freedom,\" Haynes says. \"When you have two important American principles coming into tension, into conflict with one another, our goal as Americans is to sit down and try to see if we can uphold both.\" Exercising \"freedom to worship\" in life Not all faith leaders are convinced, however, that the push for LGBT rights is jeopardizing the religious freedom of people who hold conservative beliefs about sexuality and marriage. During a recent appearance before the Council on Foreign Relations, Bishop Michael Curry, leader of the Episcopal Church in the United States, said he has witnessed the persecution of Christians in other parts of the world and doesn't see anything comparable in the United States. \"I'm not worried about my religious freedom,\" Curry said. \"I get up and go to church on Sunday morning, ain't nobody stopping me. My freedom to worship is protected in this country, and that's not going to get taken away. I have been in places where that's been infringed. That's not what we're talking about.\" Curry's reference only to \"freedom to worship,\" however, missed the point, according to some religious freedom advocates. They say they want the freedom to exercise their faith every day of the week, wherever they are \u2014 even if it means occasionally challenging the principle of absolute equality for all. \"We can't use equality to just wipe out one of the [First Amendment] rights,\" Carlson-Thies says, \"or say you can have the right, as long as you just exercise it in church, but not out in life.\" Carlson-Thies is one of several conservatives who support a \"Fairness For All\" initiative to forge a compromise between advocates for LGBT rights and religious freedom, but the effort has had little success so far. The LGBT community and their allies have been cool to the notion of compromising their cause, while a group of more strident religious freedom advocates made clear their own opposition to the recognition of sexual orientation as a status worthy of civil rights protection. Legal analysts are divided in their assessment of the debate. A federal judge, ruling on a Mississippi religious freedom law, concluded that by protecting specific beliefs, the bill \"constitutes an official preference for certain religious tenets,\" and may therefore be unconstitutional. Other laws and proposals, however, are written in support of beliefs held by several different religions and thus may not run afoul of the First Amendment's bar on \"an establishment of religion.\" John Inazu, a law professor at Washington University in St. Louis, whose book Confident Pluralism lays out an approach that might help bridge differences between LGBT and religious freedom advocates, says efforts at reconciliation face long odds. \"There were efforts early on about some kind of compromise,\" he tells NPR in a recent interview. \"I think those are less and less plausible as time goes on and as sides get factionalized. It's hard to see in some of these cases how there would be an outcome that is amenable to everyone, and so I think we're seeing these cases with us for a long time.\"",

            "article_content": "Even after the Supreme Court legalized same-sex marriage, there have been efforts to pass a religious freedom bill. LGBTQ rights advocates believe lawmakers anticipate support from the Trump administration.\n                \n                    \n                    Alex Wong/Getty Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption Even after the Supreme Court legalized same-sex marriage, there have been efforts to pass a religious freedom bill. LGBTQ rights advocates believe lawmakers anticipate support from the Trump administration. There are renewed efforts at the state level to pass so-called religious freedom bills. LGBTQ rights advocates believe that's because local lawmakers are anticipating support from the Trump administration. In Alabama, there's a bill that allows adoption agencies that are religiously affiliated to hold true to their faith if they don't think same-sex couples should be parents. The psychiatric community has found no evidence that having same-sex parents harms children. The bill is called the Child Placing Agency Inclusion Act. When it was first introduced two years ago, the bill didn't go very far. But since the election that has changed. For the first time the bill is listed on the Alabama State Senate GOP agenda. \"This bill has been fast-tracked through the House of Representatives with support from both Senate and House Republican leadership,\" says Eva Kendrick, the Alabama state manager for the Human Rights Campaign, an LGTBQ rights group. With the choice of Jeff Sessions to be attorney general, the Trump administration has picked someone who is likely to be an ally on these state bills. Back when Attorney General Sessions was a U.S. congressman, he referred to separation of church and state as something that was \"recent,\" \"unhistorical\" and \"unconstitutional.\" Sarah Warbelow, the legal director for the HRC, fears that the choice of Sessions as attorney general is a signal to local lawmakers. \"A number of states have introduced bills for many years that would allow child welfare agencies to discriminate on the basis of religious belief,\" Warbelow says. \"But since this particular executive order draft leaked out, we've seen a number of states really begin the process of moving those bills.\" In addition to the bill in Alabama, she says there are similar ones based on religious freedom that are moving more quickly in Texas, South Dakota and Oklahoma. Even without the passage of the bill, April Aaron-Brush says she and her wife have run into problems trying to adopt. They already have a 10-year-old adopted daughter. But for many years in Alabama, only Aaron-Brush could legally adopt her. Then the Supreme Court legalized same-sex marriage, and now she and her wife are recognized as parents under the law. When they decided they wanted to adopt another child, they ran into problems. \"We've had several agencies that refused to call us back already because we were a same-sex couple \u2014 although we've got marriage equality, and we're supposed to be equal\" says Aaron-Brush. \"But at this point in time, we're still having hurdles to jump over.\" Aaron-Brush says the agencies didn't explicitly tell her they were turning them down because they are a lesbian couple. But all their forms asked about a mother and father and at least one of the agencies has a Christian affiliation. Aaron-Brush has thought about investigating and perhaps taking legal action. That's why religious agencies want protection, says Eric Johnston, an attorney who represents several adoption agencies in Alabama with a religious affiliation. \"They anticipated there could be problems and wanted to \u2014 in advance \u2014 think it through and do something that would be reasonable and to the benefit of everyone concerned on both sides of the issue,\" Johnston says. The bill's sponsor in the Alabama House is Rep. Richard Wingo. \"The bill is saying that: Do not discriminate against these faith-based agencies and force them to place children \u2014 foster or adoption \u2014 into homes that go against their religious beliefs,\" Wingo says. According to Wingo, in some states, religious agencies have closed rather than be forced to put children with same-sex couples. He believes keeping them open helps more children. And he says only 30 percent of the adoption agencies in Alabama have a religious affiliation. So, he feels lesbians like Aaron-Brush have alternatives. Wingo won't say how he feels about same-sex couples adopting. \"It doesn't matter what I think,\" he says. \"If you are a follower of Christ then what matters is what does the word of God say. What does God say about it?\" Advocates for the LGBTQ community fear that this reasoning will soon make it harder for their community to adopt.",

At first, that term referred to news stories that were entirely made up. But then President Trump started calling actual news stories he didn't like \"fake news.\" According to language experts on both sides of the aisle, this new use of the phrase \"fake news\" could be a genuine threat to democracy. When we look at the stories that did the best job of holding our listeners' attention, it is clear that there was an insatiable appetite for stories that help us understand the big twists and turns of politics in the Trump era. 1. The Political Implications Of Comey's Firing Read Listen on NPR One In May, the president fired FBI Director James Comey in a letter. In this story, NPR's Domenico Montanaro and Republican Rep.

'Daily Beast' Reporter Uncovers The Curious Case Of Trump Fan Nicole Mincey Read Listen on NPR One What started out as the story of a Twitter bot became strange. President Trump retweeted a compliment from a Twitter user named Nicole. When people looked into who she was, it appeared she wasn't a real person. Except she is, but it's not that simple. This story unpacked the influence of Twitter and the ways reality can be hard to divine. 3. Trump Issues Ultimatum To House GOP On Health Care Bill Read Listen on NPR One In March, President Trump told House Republicans to either vote for the current GOP health care replacement plan or leave the Affordable Care Act in place and suffer the political consequences. NPR's Mara Liasson and Susan Davis explain that for years, an oft-repeated Republican campaign pledge was to repeal so called Obamacare, but even with control of the legislative and executive branch, the party was coming up short on the votes needed to make that pledge a reality. 4. Trump's Thursday News Conference, Explained Read Listen on NPR One President Trump held his first solo news conference in February. National security chief Mike Flynn had just been removed, the president's choice for labor secretary turned the job down and other appointments were held up. The president took questions for an hour, said the media is being \"dishonest\" and said his administration was running like \"a fine-tuned machine.\" NPR's Susan Davis and Mary Louise Kelly talk through whether the White House at the time was a fine-tuned machine or was in need of an overhaul. 5.

            "article_content": "The recent violence in Charlottesville, Va., amplified an ongoing struggle in America about who experiences discrimination and to what extent. Many of the white nationalists who rallied in Charlottesville, for example, feel that white people are discriminated against as much as, or more than, minority groups. Questioning others' experience of discrimination isn't limited to fringe protest groups. Perceptions of discrimination vary heavily across the U.S. population as a whole, as a June study from the Public Religion Research Institute showed. And those differences tend to fall along partisan lines. The survey found that a plurality of Americans \u2014 42 percent \u2014 perceive \"a lot of discrimination\" against three groups: black people, immigrants, and gay and lesbian people. But the partisan gap is large: 61 percent of Democrats believed this of all three groups, compared with 19 percent of Republicans. PRRI broke down the numbers by state. When the states' perceptions of discrimination are lined up against states' votes for Trump in 2016, it shows a clear negative correlation \u2014 places where there was bigger perception of discrimination had a lower likelihood of voting for Trump. Reliably liberal California and reliably conservative Wyoming reside at opposite ends of the spectrum. Loading... It's a relatively strong correlation, with an r-value of -0.69 (that's a statistical measure that tells the strength of correlation on a scale of -1 to 1 \u2014 a measure closer to 1 or -1 means a strong linear relationship, while a measure closer to zero means a weak linear relationship). And while states that tend to perceive less of this discrimination also tend to be whiter (85 percent-white Wyoming, for example), and white people also tend to perceive less discrimination against blacks and immigrants than other racial groups do, the white share of a state's population does not correlate to the discrimination data as well as support for Trump does. The r-value between those two series is around -0.44. The data don't say anything about the direction of correlation (standard journalist disclaimer: \"correlation is not causation\"), but it's easy to see how this relationship might exist. Trump, after all, made opposing political correctness one of his (literal) rallying cries. Wherever 2016 voters' attitudes about discrimination came from \u2014 whether stirred up by Trump or brought on by outside forces (or both) \u2014 he certainly took advantage of these feelings. That said, it's hard to separate Trump from Republicanism in general on this; a similarly strong correlation exists between this discrimination measure and a state's share of Republican voters. To Robert Jones, the founder and CEO of PRRI, it makes sense for perception of discrimination to be a partisan issue. \"I think that goes to a broader worldview thing of, it fits with a conservative bootstrap theory,\" he said. \" 'If you fail there's no one to blame but yourself.' \" But one PRRI datapoint suggests that something shifted among Republicans between 2015 and 2017. Just two years ago, 46 percent of Republicans believed there was \"a lot\" of discrimination against blacks. As of this year, that figure was 32 percent. Among independents, however, that figure held steady between those two years (it went from 59 percent in 2015 to 58 in 2017), as it held relatively steady for Democrats (going from 80 percent to 77 percent). And it's not just PRRI's data. A study on the 2016 presidential election found a \"relatively strong indication that racism and sexism were more important in 2016 than they had been in previous elections.\" The effects were particularly strong on the Republican side, with the impact of racism and sexism (as defined by the researchers) much stronger in 2016 voters' choices than in 2012 or 2008, according to the survey by the University of Massachusetts, Amherst and MacWilliams Sanders Communication. Meanwhile, a majority of Americans believes race relations have worsened in the past year, an NPR/PBS NewsHour/Marist poll found this week. Loading...",

Philippine government troops have been battling ISIS-linked militants. A recent string of violent episodes in Southeast Asian countries sheds some light on the challenges facing this region as it grapples with extremism. In Indonesia last month, two suicide bombers blew themselves up at a Jakarta bus station. The attack was linked to an ISIS-affiliated group. In Thailand, a rash of attacks linked to Islamist insurgent groups took place throughout April and into May in the restive, Muslim-dominated south \u2014 including a car bomb attack outside a shopping mall that wounded more than 50 people. And in the Philippines, ISIS-linked militants recently took over and occupied Marawi, a city in the country's Muslim-majority island of Mindanao. President Rodrigo Duterte declared martial law on Mindanao on May 23, and the Philippine army has been fighting the militants for almost three weeks. The death toll has topped 150, according to the military. The attacks raise important questions about the extent of militancy and potential threats in this region. The Islamist groups battling the Philippine military in Marawi \u2014 including the well-established Abu Sayyaf and a newer group, called Maute -- have only recently come together under the ISIS flag. And they've been getting some help from abroad, analysts say. \"We see the southern Philippines emerging as an important venue for foreign terrorist fighters,\" Rohan Gunaratna, the head of Singapore's International Centre for Political Violence and Terrorism Research, tells NPR. Foreign fighters from countries including India, Indonesia, Malaysia, Yemen and Saudi Arabia have been among those killed in the battles in Marawi, he says. Sidney Jones, who tracks militant groups in Southeast Asia as director of the Jakarta-based Institute for Policy Analysis of Conflict, says as ISIS continues to lose territory in the Middle East, fighters are looking elsewhere. \"If you can't go to Syria,\" Jones says, they think, \"go to the Philippines.\" Since its independence from the U.S. in 1946, the Philippines has grappled with an alphabet soup of separatist, Islamist groups in Mindanao. This years-long struggle has made the region a sanctuary for such groups, and fighters are drawn there by porous borders and a growing inability to make it to Syria. Jones says she expects to see more ISIS-directed and ISIS-inspired attacks in the region as a result. Philippines and beyond The Philippines, she says, is just one alternative theater that's opened up in the region. A similar situation could develop along the border of Bangladesh and Myanmar, where hundreds of thousands of Rohingya Muslims have attempted to flee persecution. An armed Rohingya insurgency already operates along this border. A recent report by Jones' organization calls this insurgency the \"wild card\" in a growing collaboration between Islamist militants in Bangladesh and Southeast Asia. Jones predicts that in the coming years, extremists from Southeast Asia may try to get to Myanmar to join Rohingya insurgents. \"Indonesian and Malaysian mujahidin have long been interested in helping their persecuted Rohingya brethren but have had no good channel for doing so,\" her organization's report says. Meanwhile, Jones sees a shift in what's driving Islamist attacks in Southeast Asia. Where they often used to be triggered by local factors \u2014 such as a sectarian conflict between Indonesia's Christians and Muslims that triggered a deadly bombing in 2002 by Jemaah Islamiyah (with some support from al-Qaida) in Bali that killed more than 200 \u2014 now, fighters are inspired by what's going on thousands of miles away in Syria and Iraq. Another growing concern in Southeast Asia is a rise in political extremism, particularly in Malaysia and Indonesia. A \"tactical, opportunistic use of hard-line Islam could have serious negative effects on the quality of democracy in those two countries,\" Jones says. A recent survey found that 9.2 percent of Indonesia's population supports the imposition of an Islamic caliphate. Indonesia is the world's most populous Muslim-majority country. Terrorism experts say the recent case of Basuki \"Ahok\" Tjahaja Purnama, the Christian former governor of Jakarta, illustrates the dangers. In April, he lost his re-election bid to a Muslim candidate. He had been charged earlier with blasphemy, and in May, he was convicted and sentenced to two years in prison. The blasphemy charge stemmed from an accusation on the campaign trail last September. The governor told a group of fishermen that any politician who quoted the Quran to say they should not vote for a non-Muslim candidate was lying to them. But he also advised them to vote their conscience. Some conservative Muslims and local hard-line Islamist organizations, such as the Islamic Defenders Front, took offense to this. Ahok later apologized and said he never intended to insult the Quran or Islam. Andreas Harsono, a Human Rights Watch researcher based in Jakarta, says the Islamist groups asked the Indonesian Ulema Council, the country's Islamic authority, to issue a fatwa declaring Ahok committed blasphemy \u2014 which the council did in October. This \"automatically divided Muslim voters, getting a lot of Muslims who believe they cannot vote [for] a blasphemer, plus mobilizing Muslims to pressure the national police to charge Ahok,\" Harsono says. During the trial, many of the same groups pushed for Ahok to be found guilty. The verdict was a win for the country's Islamists, says Harsono, who recently wrote in The Guardian they have been \"emboldened by the government's inaction on discrimination and violence against religious minorities.\" And even though the current president, Joko Widodo, is seen as a progressive, Harsono tells NPR that the government has not taken steps to undo any of the discrimination. The verdict left Ahok's supporters and those hoping for a more pluralistic Indonesia feeling vulnerable, he adds. \"The pro-Ahok group feels angry,\" says Harsono. \"The non-Muslims feel they are a minority being discriminated against ... that the government isn't doing enough to protect them.\" Different agendas, new permutations Terrorism expert Joseph Chingyong Liow, dean of Singapore's S. Rajaratnam School of International Studies at Nanyang Technological University, says it's important to keep the ISIS threat in perspective. The number of recruited fighters leaving Southeast Asia for the Middle East to answer the call of ISIS is still a mere fraction of the number of recruits the Islamic State gets from North Africa and Europe, he says. So even as ISIS loses ground in Syria and Iraq, it seems unlikely that huge swarms of fighters would come back to Southeast Asia to continue their jihad. Additionally, Islamist groups in Southeast Asia are diverse and the threat of terrorism is not confined to ISIS, he says. \"There are a number of different agendas and disputes among the jihadi groups,\" says Liow, ranging from ideology to disputes over tactics and targets. \"Efforts to unite [the groups] have proved to be quite challenging,\" he says. But even if an ISIS-affiliated group of fighters is defeated, he says, that does not mean the threat of terrorism in the region is under control. \"The threat of terrorism is not something new in Southeast Asia,\" he says. \"Every time it appears to recede, some new permutation resurfaces.\" This story includes reporting by Michael Sullivan.",

Protestors are gathering in Berkeley to protest the cancellation of a speech by American conservative political commentator Ann Coulter at UC Berkeley. Racist hate speech on campus has become the de facto litmus test for free speech protections today. But racist hate speech may not be doing what progressive free speech defenders think it is doing. Last week in Wisconsin, Republican legislators sought support for \"The Campus Free Speech Act,\" a bill that would punish University of Wisconsin System students and employees who disrupt or otherwise inhibit the free expression of invited speakers. The bill was introduced in response to a series of student protests across the country that interrupted scheduled talks by conservative speakers, including one given by ex-Breitbart editor Ben Shapiro at the University of Wisconsin-Madison last November. The bill requires the UW System to discipline those who engage in \"violent, abusive, indecent, profane, boisterous, obscene, unreasonably loud, or other disorderly conduct\" deemed to violate a speaker's right to free speech. Students could face suspension or even expulsion for repeat offenses, penalties Larry Dupuis, legal director for ACLU-Wisconsin, calls \"unnecessarily draconian.\" Although this bill takes objection to disruptive student protesters to the extreme, public support for students who would shout down the speech of others has been noticeably thin. This is true even if the speech is overtly racist, like that of white supremacist Richard Spencer, who visited Auburn University last month. Ulrich Baer, a vice provost at New York University, came out forcefully in support of student protesters, but his opinion occupies a distinctly minority position. Even voices expressly opposed to the messages of those like Spencer have advocated locating racist hate speech at the outer bounds of free speech protections \u2014 a necessary but repugnant fact of democratic life. In a recent blog entitled \"We All Need to Defend Speech We Hate,\" ACLU attorney Lee Rowland argues that preempting or shouting over racist hate speech amounts to nothing less than censorship: Our Constitution protects hateful speech, yes \u2014 but on the theory that truly free speech means the best ideas will win out. We need students trained to really listen to ideas they hate \u2014 and respond with better ones. ... When you choose censorship as your substantive argument, you lose the debate. Because none of us are the wiser about the better world those protesting students want to see \u2014 instead of telling us, they silenced others. In curricular terms: They didn't do the assignment. Rowland's rhetoric borrows from a familiar metaphor used to frame free speech debates \u2014 the so-called \"marketplace of ideas.\" Censorship is not the answer, the story goes, but more speech \u2014 better speech \u2014 is the proper response to racist hate speech. Bernie Sanders and Keith Ellison have both cosigned this approach as have prominent national opinion writers. The logic of this metaphor is that the public, as objective consumers, will reliably reject a shoddy product \u2014 here, the snake oil of racist expression. Critiques of the metaphor as it applies to free speech debates are almost as old as the metaphor itself, and a recent one contextualizes it in light of recent campus speech clashes. To these, I add the question of whether we are so sure that the rhetoric of common humanity and rights for all races will prevail. What if it doesn't, at least not anytime soon? It might mean that racist hate speech is not a \"necessary evil\" that jumpstarts racial justice within a liberal marketplace but is \u2014 for the foreseeable future \u2014 nothing more than state-sanctioned injury of people of color. Critical race theorists Richard Delgado and Jean Stefancic addressed this possibility in a 1992 Cornell Law Review article entitled \"Images of the Outsider in American Law and Culture: Can Free Expression Remedy Systemic Social Ills.\" They coin a term for the erroneous belief that \"good\" antiracist speech is the best remedy for \"bad\" racist speech: the \"empathic fallacy.\" The empathic fallacy is the conviction \"that we can somehow control our consciousness despite limitations of time and positionality ... and that we can enlarge our sympathies through linguistic means alone.\" In other words, the empathic fallacy leads us to believe that \"good\" speech begets racial justice and that we will be able to tell the difference between it and racist hate speech because we are distanced, objective arbiters. The romantic aura of transformative antiracist speech captivates us. It is comforting to think that the message of love in Martin Luther King's 1963 \"I Have a Dream\" speech vanquished the hate behind Alabama governor George Wallace's \"Segregation Now, Segregation Forever\" address delivered earlier that year. In hindsight, it was a total mismatch. It is almost as if King's words disappeared firehoses and attack dogs by their very utterance. Yet last week in Alabama, a US district judge granted the request of a predominantly-white suburb to secede from a predominantly-black county \u2014 despite acknowledging that the community's rationale is racist. \"Bad\" speech prevailed in the judge's marketplace. The \"marketplace of ideas\" fails when we cannot make objective choices about racism. \"Racism is woven into the warp and woof of the way we see and organize the world \u2014 it is one of the many preconceptions we bring to experience and use to construct and make sense of our social world,\" write Delgado and Stefancic. \"Racism forms part of the dominant narrative, the group of received understandings and basic principles that form the baseline from which we reason.\" They argue that this lack of objectivity explains how overtly racist caricatures from the 19th century were not received as negatively as they are now: \"Uncle Tom\" and \"mammy\" figures, for instance, connoted family loyalty more than racial oppression. Today, school segregation is never about racism but about \"local control\" and wanting the best for your child. Once symbolic depictions depart from the obviously grotesque, the question of whether they are racist is up for debate and not likely to be settled anytime soon. It can take centuries for a society to reach consensus that an image or narrative is demonstrably racist. The on-again off-again affair between Southern states and the Confederate battle flag reveals just how slowly racial justice moves in this regard. Despite evidence that its revival as a symbol of white supremacy coincided with the Civil Rights Movement, the flag means only \"tradition\" and \"heritage\" to its supporters. In 2016, discussion of a problematic poll revealed that attitudes toward the Washington professional football team's mascot are wildly inconsistent. Until we critically examine how our opinion of the mascot is a function of our own social conditioning \u2014 like celebrating Columbus Day, being a lifelong sports fan, having no American Indian friends \u2014 we can never be objective consumers of ideas about it. In the meantime, racist hate speech flows unabated because of our faith in a flawed metaphor. The marketplace is further gamed by \"dog whistles\" \u2014 code word replacements for overtly racist speech that still aim to stoke white resentment over the social mobility of people of color. When the sitting attorney general dismisses the ruling of a court because it resides on \"an island in the Pacific,\" he invents yet another way to signal which groups count in America and which ones don't. And if a racist idea like this one ever flops in the marketplace, its author simply recalls it by saying he was joking. Beyond the fact that there is little agreement over what is racist, the potential of speech to ennoble is undermined by the marketplace as postmodern spectacle. In a recent article, author Rich Benjamin recounts his experiences as the quasi-resident \"left-wing pundit\" on Fox's now-cancelled O'Reilly Factor. Benjamin explains that he took this role for the chance of convincing just a fraction of O'Reilly's immense audience of the worthiness of his ideas. However, he reveals just how strategic he needed to be to avoid being bullied and misrepresented by O'Reilly. \"In the thin-skinned ethos of O'Reilly's right-wing universe,\" Benjamin writes, \"the more you battered its poster boy with dead-on punches, the more ferocious the vitriol directed at you.\" In the marketplace of cable news and social media, torrents of racist emails and tweets reward you for your bright ideas. A quarter-century ago when Delgado and Stefancic published their theory of the empathic fallacy, they speculated that the infamous Willie Horton ad tipped a presidential election because voters could not view the ad objectively. We now know that racism was the primary motivation for voters who put Donald Trump in the White House. We know that the best ideas of Gold Star father Khizr Khan at the Democratic National Convention were no match for fearmongering rumors about refugees from Syria and immigrants from Mexico. We know that after almost 100 days of Trump's presidency, only two percent of those who voted for him regret it. This might mean they don't see his speech as racist or don't care if it is. If we argue that racist hate speech must be protected, we have to account for the empathic fallacy. We can start by admitting that this position is based on the troubling belief that it is one's right to be hateful \u2014 and not on the comforting belief that hate is a catalyst for racial justice in a \"marketplace of ideas.\" Better than ever, we know how specious that logic is. We can understand that student protesters may not, in fact, long for their First Amendment rights should the tables turn on them. Law professor Charles Lawrence has argued that civil rights activists in the sixties achieved substantive gains only when they exceeded the acceptable bounds of the First Amendment, only when they disrupted \"business as usual.\" Racist hate speech has come to emblemize free speech protections because the parties it injures lack social power. Students of color are expected to endure insults to their identities at the same time that celebrities win multi-million dollar defamation settlements and media companies scrupulously guard their intellectual property against plagiarism. The belief that more speech is the remedy for \"bad\" speech can be a principled stance. But for the stance to be principled, it must account for why the target of racist hate speech is less deserving of exemption than, say, the millionaire with a reputation to protect from libel, or the community flooded with sexually-explicit material, or the deep state with a dark secret. Some exemptions make good sense. But does an obscene photograph of an adult that \"lacks serious literary, artistic, political, or scientific value\" (as defined in Miller v. California, the current law of the land regarding obscenity) really do more harm than a lecture promoting white supremacy? American society fixates on antiracist protest when debating the First Amendment for the same reason it fixates on race when debating affirmative action: because of the perception that people of color are somehow undeserving of special privileges. Yet it was supporting the rights of people of color that got Desiree Fairooz arrested in January for laughing during the Senate confirmation hearing of then-attorney general nominee Jeff Sessions. This week, the Department of Justice moved forward with her prosecution, along with those of two men who had mocked Sessions with fake Ku Klux Klan robes. In March, the Human Rights Council of the UN published a letter expressing alarm at the number of legislative efforts criminalizing peaceful assembly and expression in the US. Powerful interests will find their way around the First Amendment to protect the status quo against antiracist protest. Asking student protesters to tolerate racist hate speech is to ask them to trust in free speech laws that have historically exempted the powerful and punished the vulnerable. When it comes to racism, the \"marketplace of ideas\" is not laissez-faire and never was. David Shih is an associate professor of English at the University of Wisconsin-Eau Claire.

The man at the heart of the legal resistance to the Trump agenda works in an unfinished office a block away from the White House. David Cole, the new national legal director at the American Civil Liberties Union, hasn't had time to hang pictures on the wall or remember to bring a mug to hold his morning tea. \"I get to wake up every morning and I get paid to think about how to respond in ways that will preserve our basic rights and liberties,\" Cole said. \"That's a tremendous privilege.\" Weeks into the Trump administration, the ACLU is positioning itself as the chief enforcer of the government's system of checks and balances. And near the center of that effort is Cole, who is on a four-year leave from his teaching job at Georgetown Law. When he accepted the ACLU job in the summer of 2016, Cole says, he had a very different idea about what was to come. \"The way Anthony Romero, the executive director, sold me on it was, 'Look you're going to have a liberal Supreme Court for the first time in your career as a constitutional lawyer,' \" Cole recalled. \"And that sounded like a great opportunity. I didn't put in a little condition at the bottom of the contract saying what happens if somebody else gets elected because nobody thought that was a possibility.\" In some ways, Cole has spent his life preparing for this job at this moment. It so happens that one of Cole's big breaks came nearly 30 years ago, writing legal briefs in a case where the Supreme Court, led by conservative Justice Antonin Scalia, upheld flag burning as an expression of the right to free speech. That issue took on new relevance after the election, when then-President-elect Donald Trump tweeted that people who burn the flag should be prosecuted and have their citizenship revoked. Republican leaders in Congress denounced the idea. So far, Cole said, the ACLU legal team has been keeping odd hours to try to keep track of the new administration. When one week into the Trump presidency \u2014 and two weeks into Cole's new job \u2014 Trump signed a travel ban, a team of lawyers from the ACLU stayed up all night and took the administration to court. \"Never before in the history of this country have we used the immigration law to favor one religion over another, and the bedrock principle of the Establishment Clause is that the government cannot in any area of its authority favor one religion over another religion,\" Cole said. The courts mostly agreed with the ACLU, putting Trump's original travel ban on hold. The White House has now revoked the original order and issued a new one that narrows its reach. But the ACLU says it is going to keep fighting, based on the argument that religious discrimination against Muslims permeates the whole plan. To Jay Sekulow, a lawyer at the American Center for Law and Justice, which bills itself as a counterweight to the ACLU, that's a bad approach. \"I think the ACLU is taking an extreme position,\" Sekulow said. \"They have the right to do it. They have the right to advocate their position. But I think what they've done in their proceedings is put the country at risk.\" Sekulow said he is convinced there is a valid national security purpose for the travel limits. But, he said, it makes sense for the ACLU to take its opponents to court, just as he did when he challenged President Barack Obama's actions on immigration. As for Cole, he has devoted his entire adult life to the Constitution and the courts. But he is more enthusiastic about street marches and rallies and those little blue ribbons that actors wore at the Academy Awards to honor the ACLU. In fact, Cole said in his new book, Engines of Liberty, it is the actions by people that power change. \"If you think of constitutional evolution as a sentence, the Supreme Court's decision is the period at the end of the sentence but the words in the sentence are the work of citizen activists joined together in organizations, what we call civil society, that are committed to a particular vision,\" he said. Cole said he and the hundreds of others on the ACLU legal team are prepared to test that proposition and to help organize those activists.",

Americans like to fantasize that a mixed-race future will free them from the clutches of racism. But this illusion is incompatible with an America in which the presidential election was won by the candidate who ran a \"Make America Great Again\" campaign, which many critics have pointed out was widely heard as a call to \"Make America White Again.\" If the election results are a vindication for those championing the politics of President Trump, the demographic trends point in the opposite direction. Today, the United States' mixed-race population is growing three times faster than the general population, and optimism about the impact that mixed-race people can have on a racially-divided country abounds. \"What Biracial People Know,\" a recent op-ed in The New York Times, argues that the growing multiracial population may act as a \"vaccine\" to the bigotry that buoyed Trump's campaign, granting America \"immunity\" to the longstanding politics of exclusion shaped by racism. But this hope that a mixed-race future will result in a paradise of interracial and ethnically-ambiguous babies is misleading. It presents racism as passive \u2014 a vestigial reflex that will fade with the presence of interracial offspring, rather than as an active system that can change with time. A 2015 study by Pew Research Center concluded that mixed-race Americans describe experiences of discrimination in the form of slurs, poor customer service, and police encounters. These figures were highest among people of black-white and black-Native American descent. In their personal lives, mixed-race people may feel pressure to identify with one group or the other. They may have their sense of identity or belonging dismissed by the groups to which they belong, or by the dominant society. Diana Sanchez, an associate professor in psychology at Rutgers University and a scholar of multiracial identity and experiences, says mixed-race individuals may face subtle forms of aggression in their daily interactions. \"People have trouble putting multiracial people in a box ... and have opinions about how they should be racially categorized,\" she explained. In such instances, mixed-race people may not seamlessly blend in with others' perceptions, but rather be told that they do not belong to a group, or that they must choose only one, contrary to their personal identity. For some, this disconnect between their sense of self and how the world identifies them can be difficult to navigate. But when it comes to systemic barriers, experts point out that instances of racial discrimination for mixed-race people may not be very different from the experiences of people who identify as belonging to a single race. Tanya Hernandez, professor of law at Fordham University and the author of the forthcoming book Multiracials and Civil Rights, points out that in legal cases covering a wide-range of contexts, including education, employment, public accommodations, and criminal justice, \"people who identify as mixed-race ... describe ... strikingly binary, black/white or White/non-white forms of discrimination.\" Hernandez adds that many mixed-race people find themselves discriminated against, not explicitly because of their mixed-ness, but because of their belonging to a non-white group. She explained that in most of these cases, \"the individual...is lumped together in stark contrast to whites, so it's a white/non-white racial hierarchy.\" The fact that mixed-race people who present as non-white face discrimination because of their proximity to a non-white group reinforces the idea of racial discrimination emphasizing categorization with one group, rather than hybridity. As Sanchez notes, regardless of personal identity, \"a lot of research points [out that] mixed-race people tend to be perceived along the lines of their minority identity.\" But what happens to those who aren't easily categorized? While not all mixed-race people are considered racially ambiguous, and not everyone perceived as racially ambiguous is of mixed parentage, there is evidence that the inability to categorize people as one race or the other may itself present new forms of bias. Sanchez's research suggests that white people from less-diverse neighborhoods have more difficulty processing the faces of mixed-race individuals, and that this may result in bias. White people with less exposure to non-whites \"have more discomfort trying to make decisions about mixed-race people...and that has consequences for their beliefs around those groups,\" she notes. The upshot, according to Sanchez, is that \"the more [people] are exposed to racially-ambiguous individuals, the more likely they are to see race as a social construct, not a biological one.\" That realization, that race is a social fiction, \"would be a step in the right direction ... in terms of trying to reduce racial prejudice and social inequalities,\" she says. If people are willing to accept that race is a human fabrication, they may also be more willing to shift their attitudes and perceptions about other groups. Still, Hernandez, whose work often compares discrimination in the United States to parts of Latin America, is not particularly optimistic. She points out that the myth of racial mixture leading to societal harmony has long been a feature of many Latin American countries. She illustrates the point with the popular notion that Brazil has eluded racism through racial mixture, or the idea that Venezuela is a \"caf\u00e9 con leche\" society in which everyone is racially mixed and free of prejudice. In these cases, Hernandez reiterated that the mere existence of multiracial communities \"has not undermined the continuing racial hierarchy, in which the darker you are, the worse you are thought of ... White supremacy is alive and well in Latin America.\" Acknowledging that mixed-race people may experience discrimination and that institutional racism, along with individual prejudice, can take forms that target mixed-race people, is central to developing policies that address the dynamic face of racism and the effects it has on our communities. But realizing that a mixed-race society can also uphold racism is crucial to a nuanced understanding of the challenge of recognizing and overcoming racism and bias. Ultimately, the narrative that imagines mixed-race people as a panacea for racism is a flawed one that reinforces ideas around the very existence of race. Instead, we might want to refocus our conversation around how the collective fiction of race is weaponized to limit access to equality and justice for some groups and not others, then maybe we're onto something.

            "article_content": "Updated with arguments A three-judge panel of the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals had tough questions Tuesday for both sides arguing over the future of President Trump's executive order barring refugees and citizens of seven majority-Muslim countries from entering the United States. Arguing for the administration, August Flentje, special counsel to the assistant attorney general, urged the judges to stay a temporary restraining order issued by District Judge James L. Robart of Seattle. His order last week put the Trump travel ban on hold. Flentje argued that the plaintiffs, the states of Washington and Minnesota, did not have standing to challenge the president's action because the executive order was \"well within the president's power.\" That led to a skeptical question from Judge Michelle Friedland, who asked, \"Are you arguing, then, that the president's decision in that regard is unreviewable?\" Flentje paused before saying yes. The attorney for the states challenging the travel ban also faced a grilling. Noah Purcell, solicitor general for the state of Washington, opened by saying that it's the judiciary's role to check abuses by the executive branch. \"But the president is asking this court to abdicate that role here, to reinstate the executive order without meaningful judicial review and to throw this country back into chaos, \" he said. Judge Richard Clifton wondered whether the states could really prove that Trump's ban amounted to an attempt to ban all Muslims from entering the country. \"I'm not entirely persuaded by the argument if only because the seven countries encompass only a small percentage of Muslims ...,\" said Clifton. \"I have trouble understanding why we're supposed to infer religious animus when in fact the vast majority of Muslims would not be affected as residents of those nations.\" Purcell responded that \"to prove religious discrimination we do not need to prove that this order harms only Muslims, or that it harms every Muslim.\" The legal arguments lasted just over an hour. They were conducted over the phone since the three judges preside in three different states. In his closing statement, Flentje, perhaps sensing that the court leaned away from the administration's position, argued that the temporary restraining order on the president's travel ban was too broad and he urged the judges \"to stay the injunction or to limit it to the presentation of the state of Washington.\" Here's our original post: The 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals will hear arguments Tuesday evening over whether President Trump's travel ban should remain on hold or go back into effect. Trump's executive order temporarily barred visa holders from seven majority-Muslim countries, as well as all refugees, from entering the country. It was signed on Jan. 27 and quickly challenged by an array of lawsuits. One of those cases resulted in a temporary restraining order, blocking the ban \u2014 for now \u2014 from going into effect. It's that restraining order, not the ban as a whole, that lawyers will be arguing over Tuesday. The arguments before a three-judge panel will be held by telephone at 6 p.m. ET (3 p.m. PT), and you can listen live online. Here are a few things to know before the arguments get going: How did we get here? Trump's original executive order (which we've annotated here) bars travelers from Iraq, Iran, Syria, Yemen, Sudan, Libya and Somalia for 90 days, suspends new refugee admissions for 120 days, and blocks refugees from Syria indefinitely. The White House denies that this amounts to a \"Muslim ban,\" as Trump called for during the presidential election. But all seven of the listed countries are majority Muslim. The order calls for the eventual prioritization of refugee claims from people of \"minority religions\" in their country of origin \u2014 and in an interview Trump said that Christians from the Middle East would be prioritized. On Jan. 30, Washington became the first state to sue the administration, arguing that the order is discriminatory and violates the Constitution as well as federal law. (The lawsuit is one of many challenging the travel ban.) That case \u2014 with Minnesota joining Washington \u2014 resulted in Judge James L. Robart siding with the states in granting a temporary restraining order that blocked the ban from being enforced until the court case could move forward. The Department of Justice asked the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals to immediately reinstate the ban. The court refused to immediately intervene but asked the states and the DOJ to make more arguments for and against the restraining order. Both sides have filed briefs to try to make their case and will be presenting them again in oral arguments Tuesday night. What's at stake Tuesday? The appeals court will not decide the overall legality or constitutionality of Trump's travel ban. The only thing under consideration Tuesday is the temporary suspension of the travel ban. If the court upholds the temporary restraining order, then the ban will continue to not be enforced as the court case moves forward. If the court sides with the U.S. government, the ban will go back into effect for now \u2014 and the case against the order will still move forward. On the law and policy blog Just Security, Georgetown law professor Marty Lederman \u2014 who served in the Justice Department under President Barack Obama \u2014 notes that the court's decision might not actually be that exciting. \"Just so that everyone's expectations are not unduly raised (and then dashed),\" he writes, there's \"a very real possibility\" that the court won't consider the merits of the case at all. A temporary restraining order can't usually be appealed, as the government acknowledges. The DOJ argues that it is able to appeal this one, based on technical reasons involving the difference between a temporary restraining order and a preliminary injunction. Lederman says the judges might well focus on that procedural distinction \u2014 whether it can be appealed in the first place \u2014 instead of other elements of the case. What are the arguments on each side? Aside from the procedural element (which relies on riveting questions like what counts as an adversary hearing, and how long the TRO will be in effect), the two sides are arguing over who is more likely to win the overall case over Trump's travel ban. The likelihood of winning is a factor in determining whether a temporary restraining order is appropriate. The DOJ cites the president's broad authority on immigration issues as a reason the government is likely to win this case, eventually. The states, meanwhile, say they'll win, based on their evidence that the travel ban was designed to discriminate on the basis of religion and violates the right to due process. Then there's the question of \"irreparable harm.\" Washington state originally asked for the restraining order because it argued the travel ban was actively harming its residents. The federal government, meanwhile, argues that suspending the ban is causing harm by violating the separation of powers and exposing citizens to risk, and also because it amounts to \"judicial second-guessing\" of the president's judgment on national security. (The state says the temporary restraining order just restores the status quo from before the ban, and that the DOJ's argument \"makes no sense.\") The DOJ also argues that even if it were appropriate, the temporary restraining order should have been imposed more narrowly, rather than nationwide \u2014 while the states say a nationwide halt was necessary to protect residents who might travel through a port of entry anywhere in the country. Who are the judges who will decide? The arguments on each side will be presented to a three-judge panel of the 9th Circuit: William Canby Jr., Richard Clifton and Michelle T. Friedland. Canby was appointed by Jimmy Carter, Clifton by George W. Bush and Friedland by Obama. What happens next? As the appeals court considers the DOJ's request to reimpose the executive order, the case continues to move forward at the district level. A host of other lawsuits challenging the executive order are also unfolding across the country \u2014 The Hill reports that there are more than 50 such lawsuits brought by state attorneys general, religious groups and individuals. Eventually, one of the cases might well make it before the U.S. Supreme Court. Bob Ferguson, the attorney general of Washington state, told NPR's Michel Martin he sees that as \"entirely possible.\" As NPR's Nina Totenberg has reported, Senate Democrats have signaled that the executive order might factor into confirmation hearings for Judge Neil Gorsuch, Trump's nominee for the court's open seat, as they weigh his position on the legality and constitutionality of the travel ban.",

            "article_content": "A new survey looks at who feels discriminated against in America. The short answer: everyone, but for different reasons. And for some, it's nothing new. NPR's Code Switch team reports on how African-Americans responded.  ROBERT SIEGEL, HOST: Americans of many different backgrounds say racial discrimination is a factor in the daily life of the country. That's according to a new survey out today from NPR, the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation and the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health. Researchers surveyed people from various socioethnic groups to see how and how much they've experienced discrimination. Karen Grigsby Bates of NPR's Code Switch team reports on the study's findings from the group that reported facing the most discrimination, African-Americans. KAREN GRIGSBY BATES, BYLINE: Many black people will tell you that discrimination is so ever-present in their daily lives it's kind of like background noise. It's there, but you don't always pay attention to it. So when I asked Beverly Reeves during a recent street festival in the heart of LA's black community if she ever experiences discrimination... You're laughing. Why? BEVERLY REEVES: Because it's kind of like - I felt like saying it's, like, kind of a duh, you know? BATES: Kind of a duh - it's that obvious. Reeves says her most recent experience was last weekend when she'd booked manicure appointments for a group of friends - some black, some white - in her suburban neighborhood. The white salon owner, she says, looked right past Reeves to take care of her white guests even though Reeves had arrived first and was hosting the event. REEVES: I felt very hurt by that and very discriminated against. And I have not frequented that establishment since. BATES: Down the street, Robert Watkins says he's experienced lots of little cuts like the one Reeves just described and more serious ones as well. ROBERT WATKINS: But it was with LAPD. And yeah, it was some racist officers, yeah, I dealt with. BATES: Harvard's Robert Blendon at the Chan School of Public Health says discrimination might not be a surprise to the groups that are experiencing it, but it might be news to people outside their group. And that's where this survey, which talked to more than 3,400 people of various backgrounds, might be helpful. ROBERT BLENDON: So if somebody said, yes, I saw in the news that someone was just terribly treated by police but, you know, that doesn't happen very frequently, we've now allowed people to say, well, there is an independent survey which represents people's experiences across the African-American community. And this is what they say actually happened. BATES: Ninety-two percent of African-Americans surveyed said discrimination against black Americans exists today. Half of those thought discrimination that is based on an individual's prejudice is a larger problem compared to the 25 percent that feel institutional discrimination is more problematic. Michael Jeffries, a historian at Wellesley College, says people might not recognize systemic discrimination when it's carried out by an individual. Robert Watkins only saw individual officers, not a biased system. MICHAEL JEFFRIES: If you don't have a sense of the way police officers are afforded leeway by the legal system to use force and deadly force, then you might be more likely to chalk up instances of police brutality and harassment to individual bad actors rather than a system that has no mechanism for police accountability. BATES: In the survey, worry about policing was high on the list of black respondents' concerns. Sixty-one percent believe that police officers in their neighborhoods are more likely to use unnecessary force on them than on a white person, and over 50 percent say they've experienced racial slurs or people who've made insensitive or derogatory comments about their race. Wellesley's Michael Jeffries isn't surprised. He believes the current political climate is a big reason. JEFFRIES: The president has inflamed racial tensions purposefully and repeatedly. BATES: A poll by the Center for the Study of Hate and Extremism at California State University, San Bernardino, says hate crimes rose 20 percent during the 2016 election. The Southern Poverty Law Center's trackers say that trend continues in 2017. And it's not just black people who've experienced discrimination. In the coming weeks, we'll report on Latinos, Asians, Native Americans and whites, men and women and LGBTQ adults. Everyone has a story, but maybe they don't know anyone else's story, which, says Harvard's Bob Blendon, is the point of this survey. BLENDON: What's really unusual about this is we're giving people a chance to speak to other people who are not members of their own groups. BATES: With some hard numbers based on lived experience, Blendon hopes this might change some of the dialogue on race and discrimination over time. Karen Grigsby Bates, NPR News.

            "article_content": "As President Trump's official lawyer, Don McGahn's job description puts him at the center of every legal decision made in the White House. Even though his name is rarely mentioned, McGahn is involved in nearly all of the White House drama in the news.  ROBERT SIEGEL, HOST: In all the White House drama that occupies almost every news day - the firing of the FBI director, controversial travel bans, the Russia investigation - there is one name that's always present but hardly ever mentioned - Don McGahn. He's the White House counsel, the president's official lawyer, which puts him at the center of every legal decision made in the White House. NPR legal affairs correspondent Nina Totenberg reports. NINA TOTENBERG, BYLINE: Don McGahn is walking in some impressive shoes as the White House counsel. Some of the most respected lawyers in the country have served in the position. But in contrast to most of his predecessors, McGahn was not widely known before taking the job, even in conservative Republican circles. Indeed, in some ways, he's an odd fit - or at least, like the president he serves, an unconventional one. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) SCOTTS NEW BAND: (Playing \"Sweet Child Of Mine\"). TOTENBERG: That's Don McGahn on guitar, a long-haired rocker in Scott's New Band, performing all over the mid-Atlantic for more than a decade until August 25, 2016. That's the day the Trump campaign announced McGahn would be its general counsel and the band simultaneously announced its retirement. If there's a single word that pops up repeatedly about McGahn it's iconoclast, defined in multiple dictionaries as, quote, \"a person who attacks settled or cherished beliefs and institutions, a cynic, a nonbeliever.\" That certainly is the role he played when Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell picked him to serve as one of three Republican members of the Federal Election Commission, the government agency charged with enforcing campaign finance laws. The three Democrats on the commission soon saw the GOP members voting in lockstep as never before. The result was a deadlocked commission that didn't enforce much of anything in campaign finance rules. That, at least, is what Democratic commissioner Ellen Weintraub says. ELLEN WEINTRAUB: McGahn came in with the mission of trying to make the agency as ineffective as possible. TOTENBERG: McGahn never tried to hide his antipathy for campaign finance regulation. In one infamous incident, he became so angry that he literally tore up the agency's rulebook and threw the pieces across the table at a Democratic commissioner. He may have led the charge, but even some Democratic election lawyers can see that he was doing what the congressional Republican leadership wanted. And he proved uncommonly good at it. Now he is in charge of dozens of legal issues at the White House, including making sure that the White House staff and the president's appointees across the government comply with the nation's ethics laws and regulations. Again, the FEC's Ellen Weintraub. WEINTRAUB: My concern is that having seen the way McGahn seemed to really enjoy trying to find ways around the rules, I don't know what kind of advice somebody like that is giving. TOTENBERG: Very good advice, replies Leonard Leo of the conservative Federalist Society. LEONARD LEO: Don McGahn is the right person to be counsel to the president in this administration because he has the trust and confidence of Mr. Trump, because every day the White House counsel has to say no to the president. The counsel to the president just has to explain to his boss that either he can't do what he wants to do or he has to do it differently. TOTENBERG: For this piece, NPR talked to more than a dozen people, including former White House counsels, Justice Department officials and McGahn's former law partners. What's striking is that most who know and like him, even Democratic lawyers, don't want to be quoted by name because they do business with the White House or the Trump business empire. The Federalist Society's Mr. Leo is one of the exceptions. He points to one of McGahn's signal successes, the appointment and confirmation of Judge Neil Gorsuch to the Supreme Court. Unlike the rest of the Trump administration rollout, the Gorsuch process was a no-drama affair executed flawlessly with Leo as the outside man and McGahn the inside man. Indeed, part of McGahn's job is to supervise the vetting and choosing not only of Supreme Court nominees but nominees to fill some 130 vacancies on the lower federal courts, a number that is unusually large because Senate Republicans approved very few judicial nominees in the last years of the Obama administration. The prospect of McGahn's very conservative hand in these choices sends shivers of horror through many Democratic lawyers and some moderate Republicans as well. But the choices so far more than please the GOP conservative base from social conservatives to big business. Less pleasing has been the handling of a significant number of legal issues in the White House. It's hard to determine how much of the blame for that goes legitimately to McGahn given the chaotic nature of the Trump presidency, but part of the job of the White House counsel is to prevent legal fiascos. Take the Trump executive order that barred people from seven predominantly Muslim countries. After briefly paralyzing a number of airports here and abroad, the carelessly drafted order was struck down by five district courts and a federal appeals court. Eventually, the president signed a second executive order, which he now disdains as watered down. But that second order has also been blocked by the courts and is pending in the Supreme Court. Leonard Leo defends McGahn's handling of the travel bans. LEO: Remember that the role of the White House counsel's office is simply to look at a proposed executive order and determine whether or not that order is legal on its face. TOTENBERG: Former White House counsels from both parties disagree, arguing McGahn should have taken into account the problematic statements that Trump made during and after the campaign promising to ban Muslims, statements that have doomed the ban at least so far as, among other things, based on religious discrimination. Another aspect of McGahn's job is enforcing compliance with ethics rules, a job that has proved particularly nettlesome in this administration. While former White House counsel say they always work closely with the Office of Government Ethics to ensure compliance with ethics laws throughout the government, the Trump White House has clashed repeatedly with the ethics office. Inside the White House, McGahn has assembled what both admirers and critics say is a crackerjack legal team of more than 30 lawyers, including former Supreme Court law clerks, people who've served in top Justice Department jobs, staff the Senate Judiciary Committee or practice in major law firms. McGahn supporters say he is a standup guy taking the bullet when he has to in conversations with President Trump. For instance, when the first travel order was struck down and Trump tweeted an escalating series of attacks on the judiciary, Supreme Court nominee Gorsuch was quoted as telling senators privately that he found attacks on the judiciary, quote, \"disheartening and demoralizing.\" Trump, according to knowledgeable sources, was furious, and McGahn defused the situation by taking the blame. But as the Russian investigation has heated up, leading to the firing of the FBI director and the dismissal of the national security adviser, McGahn has grown increasingly uneasy about his role. His job, he knows, is to defend the institution of the presidency, not the president himself, and he is said to have pressed for the hiring of a private lawyer to represent the president personally during the ongoing investigations. In a White House filled with warring personalities, McGahn is something quite different, according to Leonard Leo. LEO: Don McGahn has a nickname amongst some of us who know him, the quiet man, in the sense that he's not seeking glory. He's not seeking attention. He's trying to advise the president. And he's trying to do it in a way catastrophes are avoided. TOTENBERG: But as another conservative McGahn friend put it, even if the great Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes were advising this president it wouldn't matter. Nina Totenberg, NPR News, Washington.

STEVE INSKEEP, HOST: A ruling against President Trump's latest travel ban answers a question often posed by the president's supporters. The question is what the Constitution has to do with an order affecting foreigners. Judges in Maryland and Hawaii have both stopped the ban on travel from six majority-Muslim countries. The Hawaii judge says it's likely the travel order will be found unconstitutional, and he says why. The president's travel order stops visitors from six majority-Muslim countries. And it is true that visitors cannot claim all the constitutional rights of U.S. citizens. But the judge's ruling does not center on who they are. It centers on who we are. The Constitution says the United States government will not favor one religion over another. NPR's Hansi Lo Wang has been covering this story. He's on the line. Hansi, good morning. HANSI LO WANG, BYLINE: Good morning, Steve. INSKEEP: So what is the evidence for how this order did or did not clash with the Constitution? WANG: Well, the judges said that the Trump administration was arguing that these six countries posed a threat, a national security threat. And the judges say there's not enough evidence to back up that claim, that banning these six majority-Muslim countries - travelers from these countries was necessary for maintaining national security. And that - also that there's a strong likelihood here that if this case were to continue it would violate the First Amendment, specifically the Establishment Clause. The government can't favor one religion over another through this travel ban. INSKEEP: Although the revised executive order did specifically state this is not religious discrimination. This is not about anybody's particular religion. It's about national security. How did the judge address that? WANG: Well, the judge in Hawaii, Derrick Watson, he was the first to issue an order last night. He argued that a reasonable, objective observer, based on public statements from the Trump administration, you know, the same administration that - made up of campaign officials that released a press release that called for a total and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the U.S. before the election - this was all designed to disfavor one particular religion, Islam. And, you know, of course, the Justice Department, like you said, argued that they were not targeting against Muslims. Specifically, you know, one reason was that only a small percentage of Muslims would be affected by the travel ban. But the judge, Derrick Watson, he said, you know, quote, \"the illogic of the government's contentions is palpable.\" He argued, you know, you don't have to target everyone in a group to be discriminating against a group. And there's well-established legal precedence for that. INSKEEP: So the president's own words were used against him. And then last night, he had an opportunity to offer up some more words. WANG: That's right. President Trump was at a rally in Nashville, and he described the Hawaii order as unprecedented judicial overreach. And he said this travel ban that the Hawaii judge has blocked is a revised version of his original travel ban. And, you know, some changes include, you know, Iraq being taken off the list of countries banned, green card holders being exempt, Syrian refugees not being banned indefinitely, people being able to apply for waivers. And he says his lawyers were responding to the earlier 9th Circuit Court ruling. But Trump also raised the question of whether the Hawaii order was done for political reasons. And he says - Trump says he regrets toning it down. Here's what he said. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: This is a watered-down version of the first one. This is a watered-down version. And let me tell you something, I think we ought to go back to the first one and go all the way, which is what I wanted to do in the first place. (CHEERING) INSKEEP: Any idea, Hansi, if we should take him literally? Do we know what the administration will actually do? WANG: We're not exactly sure what the next steps are, but it's possible that the Hawaii order and the Maryland order ultimately will go to an appeals court. And so this may end up at the Supreme Court at a later date. INSKEEP: Which would be the final arbiter of any number of lawsuits. There's a variety of lawsuits out there right now. Is that right? WANG: That's right. INSKEEP: OK, Hansi, thanks very much. Really appreciate it. WANG: You're welcome, Steve. INSKEEP: That's NPR's Hansi Lo Wang in New York City. Copyright \u00a9 2017 NPR.

            "article_content": "Debates over gerrymandering are leading to redistricting overhaul efforts and legal battles around the country. One Wisconsin case could change the way district lines are drawn nationwide.  LULU GARCIA-NAVARRO, HOST: How political boundaries are drawn is getting a lot of scrutiny this year. Many voters say they're tired of gerrymandering, which they say dilutes their political power. The Supreme Court will hear a redistricting case next month that could change the way district lines are drawn nationwide. NPR's Sarah McCammon looks at the battle shaping up around the country. SARAH MCCAMMON, BYLINE: Last month, during a debate on the North Carolina House floor, a visiting baseball team fresh from a stinging loss in the Little League World Series became an object lesson. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) DEB BUTLER: What if we had told those children, boys do the best you can but you're going to start six runs down. And you're going to bat left-handed, even if you're a right-y. And you're going to have to hop on one foot to first base. MCCAMMON: State Representative Deb Butler compared North Carolina politics to a rigged game. Butler, a Democrat, urged her colleagues to vote against approving newly drawn legislative district boundary maps. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) BUTLER: That's not fair. So in life, in sports and in politics, the public expects a level playing field. MCCAMMON: The maps were created under the direction of Republican leaders after a panel of federal judges ruled the old system underrepresented black voters. Many Democrats argue they're still unfair. Race is also an issue in Texas, where an ongoing case looks at whether congressional and legislative districts were unfairly drawn to dilute the power of Hispanic voters. Brendan Steinhauser is a Republican strategist in Austin. He says gerrymandering is a bipartisan problem that hasn't yet been solved. BRENDAN STEINHAUSER: Until it is, I think you're going to see elected officials at the state legislature draw maps in a way that benefit their own political party. But I do think that most Republicans here in the state would say that does not equate with the idea of intentional racial discrimination. MCCAMMON: In Wisconsin, the Supreme Court is weighing whether Republicans unfairly drew the maps along partisan rather than racial lines. Rick Esenberg is a Republican and President of the Wisconsin Institute For Law And liberty, which filed an amicus brief in the case. He says the current maps favor Republicans because of what he calls a natural disadvantage for Democrats - the fact that their voters tend to live in urban geographically-compact areas. RICK ESENBERG: We see this every time after every presidential election when there's a map of the United States which shows results by county. And we see that the United States looks like a sea of red with patches of deep blue. MCCAMMON: Esenberg says asking the courts to fix that would just force them to get involved in political decisions that he says should be left to the legislature. The U.S. Supreme Court's ruling in Wisconsin will have implications for ongoing litigation in other states, including Maryland, where Republicans accuse Democrats of gerrymandering. Michael Li is senior counsel with the Democracy Program at the Brennan Center For Justice. He says the Supreme Court has long held that racial gerrymandering is out of bounds. And it now has a chance to rule that partisan gerrymandering is, too. MICHAEL LI: That's a really big thing because, right now, a lot of people feel that they can get away with anything they want if it's politics and not race. MCCAMMON: In a country where race and politics are increasingly intertwined, Li says the court's decision could have big implications when states draw new maps after the 2020 census.

Latinos say institutional discrimination, including discrimination while trying to vote or participate in politics, is a problem in America today. However, when asked, many Latinos reported feeling better about their local government. That's according to a new survey out this week from NPR, the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation and the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health. The survey found that 15 percent of Latinos say they've been discriminated against personally when trying to vote or participate in politics because they are Latino. Separately, 1 in 10 says that where he or she lives, other Latinos are \"often\" discriminated against in voting or politics. Loading... Compared with African-Americans, Latinos were slightly less likely to say that overall, there is discrimination against their own group in America today. However, those who did think discrimination against Latinos exists were more likely compared with African-Americans to say institutional discrimination is the bigger problem. Loading... Like younger African-Americans, though, younger Latinos were more likely to see institutional discrimination as a bigger problem compared with older people in their ethnic and racial group. Jaime Gonzalez, a college freshman in Texas, voted for the first time last year. At the time, a version of the state's strict photo ID law was in place. He says he ran through the state's strict voting rules and made sure he was ready before he got to the polls. \"I just show them a government ID, like my driver's license, my ID \u2014 Texas ID,\" Gonzalez explains. Federal courts have ruled that the Texas voter ID law was designed to intentionally discriminate against minorities. That's because minority voters are statistically less likely to have the type of ID allowed at the polls under the law. Gonzalez said he found the state's voting laws frustrating. \"It's unfair,\" he said. \"That's it.\" Overall, Latinos say that discrimination based in government laws and policies is a big problem facing them today. \"It makes sense considering where we are politically right now,\" says Victoria DeFrancesco-Soto, a professor at the LBJ School of Public Affairs at the University of Texas. \"So essentially since Donald Trump launched his campaign he really put Latinos in the bulls-eye.\" DeFrancesco-Soto says when Trump kicked off his presidential campaign, he did it by targeting Mexicans. Trump has also promised a wall on the Southern border and said a judge could not treat him fairly because the judge was of Mexican descent. \"But then you flip that,\" she continues, \"and I think the silver lining to this is that you see Latinos in their urban areas \u2014 Latinos tend to be concentrated in metropolitan areas \u2014 that they feel positive about what their local officials are doing for them.\" And that's something the survey found, too. Loading... About 60 percent of Latinos say local government represents the views of people like them either \"somewhat well\" or \"very well.\" Additionally, when asked, \"How much can people like you affect what your local government does,\" 61 percent of Latinos say some or a great deal. Delia Garza, a city counselor in Austin, says in the first few weeks of the Trump administration there was a large spike in immigration raids in the area. \"We included funding for immigrant services after all the ICE raids happened,\" Garza says. \"I mean, that is directly helping our immigrant population. These are such great things we that we are able to do at the local level that could not have been done at the state level.\" Garza is the first Latina to sit on the Austin City Council. She represents a part of Austin that is almost 70 percent Latino. She says she thinks it helps that local officials in bigger cities tend to come from backgrounds similar to the people they represent. Three of the Austin City Council's 11 seats are currently held by Latinos. \"Because when you represent a district like mine and you see working families that need a little help,\" Garza says, \"it's important to have an elected official [who] represents them that understands that.\" Latinos in Austin say they feel that. Daniel Segura-Kelly, a local activist, says he feels like Latinos in Texas have a target on their back, but he feels better being in Austin. \"We have a city council that is wildly supportive of our community,\" he says. \"Our community can know that this is a safe place.\"",

Hillary Clinton says she would not rule out questioning the legitimacy of the 2016 election if new information surfaces that the Russians interfered even more deeply than currently known. In an interview with Fresh Air's Terry Gross about her new memoir, What Happened, Clinton acknowledges that such a challenge would be unprecedented and that \"I just don't think we have a mechanism\" for it. Russia is only one aspect of the tumultuous campaign that Clinton reflects on in What Happened, 10 months after losing her bid for the presidency. She also discusses her experiences as the first woman running for president as a part of a major political party and her view on the direction that the country is headed. \"I am fundamentally optimistic about our country, but I am not naive, and I don't think we can change things unless we take it seriously,\" Clinton says. What follows is the transcript of the conversation between Clinton and Gross, which was recorded at WHYY's studio in Philadelphia. Terry Gross: Hillary Clinton, welcome to Fresh Air, and thank you for being here in our studio. It is a pleasure to have you here. Hillary Clinton: Thank you so much, Terry; I am delighted to be here. So I want to pick up where we left off [during Clinton's 2014 Fresh Air interview] \u2014 and this isn't going in the direction that you think it is, so bear with me. So the last time we talked, an excerpt of our interview went viral, and we'd spent a few minutes earlier on the air talking about as secretary of state you were a strong LGBTQ rights advocate, saying, \"Gay rights are human rights. Human rights are gay rights.\" And after that I asked you about whether there were gay-related positions, LGBTQ-related positions, such as marriage equality, that were more difficult to support when you were a senator, because you thought the public, the voters, weren't ready yet. So this went viral, and the takeaways and the press seemed to be that you were evasive, and in some parts of the press, that you weren't quick enough to endorse marriage equality. I wanted to tell you my takeaway. My questions were a little unclear and unfocused. I think you were a little evasive, but here's my real takeaway: Although a lot of people, including myself, might've assumed that this went viral because of gay-rights activists pushing it out, it was the opposite. It actually went viral because of a right-wing website called America Rising. They had it up before we even had it up on our website, and America Rising's goal was to take quotes from the mainstream press and use them against you. So the excerpt of our interview was taken out of context; it no longer had the context of you being a forceful LGBTQ advocate as secretary of state, and really you were definitely going to be stronger on LGBTQ rights than anyone America Rising would likely support for president. So here was the right trying to turn your base against you, the right attacking you from the left. So my question to you is, did you know that America Rising was behind pushing it out and helping it go viral? I didn't know specifically who it was, Terry, but I've had now so much experience in both watching and being the object of a lot of right-wing attacks, and they've gotten increasingly sophisticated. So many times you don't know where they're coming from, and as I write in my book, they are now aided and abetted by Russia and by other groups that are part of this right-wing ecosystem and echo chamber. So I would not be surprised to hear that about anything that I've said, because in the campaign we've just finished, the amount of right-wing attacks of foreign interference and influence has just exploded. So what used to be kind of a cottage industry by the right is now much more sophisticated, pervasive and in alliance with one of our foreign adversaries. Let's get to the present. Losing is always hard. Mmhmm. Did it make it especially hard knowing that the person you lost to, who is now our president, is somebody you've described as \"a con man with no experience to be president and not the right temperament to be president\"? It did make it a lot more painful. I have said, \"Look, if I lost to another Republican I would be disappointed. I would not agree with a lot of their approach toward economics and other important issues, but I wouldn't fear for my country.\" I believe that Donald Trump poses a clear and present danger to our democracy, to our institutions, to the rule of law, to the civil rights and human rights of so many Americans, to the economic distribution of wealth \u2014 which is already skewed out of proportion to where it should be. I tried to say that during the campaign, and I tried to warn people, because I actually believed him. I believed that he would follow through. There were lots who said, \"Oh, he never will! He's not going to do all those things he said about building a wall and immigrants and the like.\" And I thought he was getting so indebted to a minority in our country, but a vocal, very determined minority, that was going to try to hold him to his campaign promises \u2014 and nothing I've seen in the last months, ever since he took office, has made me feel much better. So you were the first woman to be nominated for president by a major American party. And you've said that there are things you felt you couldn't say because you couldn't afford to sound like an angry woman. What's an example of one of those things you would've liked to say, but you didn't want to sound like an angry woman? Well, I have an example in the book from the second debate, where I was feeling really uneasy, uncomfortable, because of the way he was lurking behind me, leering at me, staring at me. I knew that because of what had happened with the Access Hollywood tape he was going to try to change the subject and I knew that he was going to try to get into my head, and knock me off my game. And so I had practiced keeping my composure, and I did. But in the book, as I describe this, I say, \"What if I had turned around and said, 'You know, you love to intimidate women, you're not going to intimidate me! Back up, you creep!' \" Right? Well, say you'd said that. What would've happened, you think? I think it would have delighted my supporters. It would've enraged his supporters. And it would have been troubling to a lot of people still trying to make up their mind one way or the other, because anger from a woman, at least up until now, is seen as off-putting and somewhat frightening to people. And I knew that; I'd studied all the research. I had lived my life. I was well aware of it. So in the end I didn't say anything. I kept my composure, got through the debate, most everybody said I won it, which is fine, but there were other opportunities that I might have taken to try to more clearly point out the sexism and the misogyny of this man I was running against, because clearly he was Exhibit A of the remaining problems we have in making sure that women are not treated unfairly and with disrespect. Can I play you what I think is one of the more unusual things that Donald Trump said during the campaign? I'd love to hear your take on this. So this was in December, and I forget which debate it was after, he was at a rally. And he was talking about you showing up late to the debate after a break, that you were late to the podium after a break during the debate, and I want to play you what he said about that. TRUMP: I'm watching the debate and she disappeared. Where did she go? Where did she go? I thought she quit! I thought she gave up. Where did she go? Where did Hillary go? They had to start the debate without her. Phase two: I know where she went. It's disgusting. I don't want to talk about it! It's too disgusting. Don't say it, it's disgusting. Let's not \u2014 we want to be very, very straight up. Wasn't that a weird deal? We're ready to start, they were looking. They gave her benefit of the doubt. OK, so that was Donald Trump last December. Hillary Clinton, what did you make of what he was saying? I interpret that as meaning you went to the ladies' room and that's disgusting. Is that just me, or is that how you interpret it? That's exactly how I interpreted it, Terry. I did go to the ladies' room, and the ladies' room, as I remember, was much further than the men's room, and so it took me longer to get there, and as every woman listening to this interview knows, it took me longer once I was inside and then it took me longer to get back. And I thought it was a little strange that the TV station carrying the debate went ahead and started. They knew where I went. I mean, they have all these people backstage. They knew how far it was, because, actually, my advance people had said, \"It's going to take her longer if she has to go to the restroom, to get there and back.\" That is what people do on breaks. That is what people do! You go to the restroom if you need to, and I needed to. So look, it was a little surprising to me that they actually started the broadcast again before I got back. They could've done a million different things to give me a few more extra seconds. I got back. And it's like the age-old story that you go to a stadium or some other big public place and they claim, \"We've got the same number of restrooms for men and women\" \u2014 but of course it takes us a little longer. So, when I heard him say that, it was in the same frame that he said those horrible things to Megyn Kelly, that he has insulted women his entire life. We have records of it going back decades. But what did it mean to you that Donald Trump thought that the idea of you using the ladies' room was \"disgusting,\" something that he couldn't even think about, absolutely disgusting. What did that say to you? It said to me that this is a very emotionally strange man. That that would even, No. 1, cross his mind, and No. 2, that he would share it at a rally, that he thought it would endear him or motivate the supporters he had at a rally. Look, I don't pretend to be a psychiatrist and to try to figure out what goes on in his head, but if you, and you're right to point this out, if you just give it a few moments' thought, really, what was that about? He sexualizes women. He objectifies women. He's more than happy to comment on what women look like and whether they're too thin or too fat or whatever his particular obsession might be. But what about women who use restrooms? (Which is all of us.) What about women who give birth? (Which is many of us?) What about women who have all kinds of physical parts of their life? It said to me, \"No, I can't be bothered. I can't even think about that. I want to see you in a low-cut dress. I want to see you in a bathing suit. I want to see whether you fit my standards.\" And I thought it was incredibly weird. During the campaign you heard a lot of \"Lock her up! Lock her up!\" Your reaction the first time you heard people chanting that \u2014 when was it, and what do you remember about it? The first time I'm actually aware of hearing it was at the Republican convention. I think it went on before that. I didn't pay a lot of attention to it. I thought, \"OK, fine. He is whipping up his crowds. He is throwing them red meat, and I'm Exhibit A of that.\" But when they brought it inside to their convention, so that it became, in effect, part of the historic record of the general election, I was stunned. I thought, \"What are they talking about and why are they saying this?\" It was, to me, really not only wrong \u2014 because obviously there was no basis for it \u2014 but it was politics at a very high level being affected by the most dangerous partisan hyperbole. It was, to me, really not only wrong \u2014 because obviously there was no basis for it \u2014 but it was politics at a very high level being affected by the most dangerous partisan hyperbole. Hillary Clinton This is a question I should probably ask the Secret Service, but I'll ask you. You're the one on the microphone. What implications did all those chants of \"lock her up\" have for your security, your personal security? It was a constant challenge for the Secret Service and for what they call \"threat assessment.\" It was something that I was aware of. I had a few times people jumping over ropes and rushing the stage and a few really nasty, threatening things said in a crowd. But what really was unhinged were the online attacks. And they weren't just directed at me, they were directed at anyone \u2014 particularly women \u2014 who went online and said they were supporting me. If they identified themselves as a supporter of mine, they were attacked from both the left and the right. They were often subjected to the most vile Twitter responses, YouTube comments you can imagine. It was just so horrific to see the horrible things being said and the threats that were being made, physical threats, to my supporters. I want to ask you about some of the longtime anti-Clinton people who were affiliated with the Trump campaign. I read Joshua Green's book [Devil's Bargain] about Steve Bannon, and he writes [that] Bannon, Kellyanne Conway and David Bossie were a team of professional anti-Clinton operatives. They had been plotting to tear [you] apart for 25 years. They were all on Trump's team. David Bossie, who was the deputy campaign manager for Trump's campaign, he founded Citizens United, which produced the film Hillary: The Movie, which led to the Citizens United Supreme Court decision that eliminated corporate spending restrictions. And you ran in one of those elections that was so profoundly affected by Citizens United. Yes, it was the first time. Yes. Then Kellyanne Conway \u2014 she had been, like, an anti-Bill Clinton pundit when he was president. Her husband helped impeach your husband by drafting the Supreme Court brief when Paula Jones sued your husband. Steve Bannon was, of course, the head of Breitbart News, and it was his idea to get Peter Schweizer to write the book Clinton Cash, which stoked the controversy over the Clinton Foundation, and that was funded by the Mercer family. So were you expecting that if you ran for president, that the longtime anti-Clinton operatives would be part of your opposing campaign? Well, I knew that they would be out there. Whether they were actually in a campaign \u2014 which originally they were not; they were backing other candidates besides Trump \u2014 I knew that they would still be coming after me. And Terry, I have to say that the Republicans have been afraid of my husband and me for many years, and I think part of it is we don't go away, we don't give up, because we understand what's at stake. ... the Republicans have been afraid of my husband and me for many years, and I think part of it is we don't go away, we don't give up, because we understand what's at stake. Hillary Clinton They fear us in large measure because my husband was a master politician who came out of the South, who understood and had been fighting against a lot of the same bigotry, bias, prejudice, paranoia that has been at work in American politics. When he was a governor he took on the NRA. He took on race. He stood up against a lot of these forces, and then he did so again when he was president. Bill and I are under no illusions about what we are up against. I sometimes believe that too many other politicians think the game is on the level. You know, you mentioned Citizens United: This was an effort against me which led \u2014 because there's a Republican majority in the Supreme Court \u2014 to the worst decision: opening up the floodgates for not only unlimited money but undisclosed money. And I was the first presidential candidate on the Democratic side who had to run in that environment. So I view it as a perverse compliment from these really dedicated right-wingers, because they know that I know what they're really up to. They want a constitutional convention to rewrite America's Constitution to better favor business, to favor religious beliefs, to tear down the wall between church and state. OK, but in terms of all the anti-Clinton operatives who ended up being part of the Trump campaign, that's what I think some Democrats were afraid of when they said the Clintons have too much baggage, we don't want Hillary to run because she brings too much baggage with her \u2014that's part of the baggage they're talking about. Well, but that's all retroactive, because before I announced, 82 percent of Democrats said they wanted to see me run, and a very, very large proportion wanted to support me. And part of it is because they know that I will stand up and fight back. I know what happened to our candidates in 2014, before I ever ran, before I announced that I would run. I was campaigning hard for Democrats in that midterm election, and I saw what the right was doing to really good people \u2014 people like Sen. Kay Hagan in North Carolina. People like our wonderful candidate Michelle Nunn in Georgia. People who didn't have a history of being lightning rods for the right, that didn't give them any favor; the right wants to defeat all Democrats, all moderate Republicans, all people who believe, as I believe, that we are in a real struggle for the future of America between these very powerful interests. It was always such a shorthanded unsatisfactory way for some on the left to say, \"Oh well, it's all Wall Street.\" No. This is financial. This is religious. This is partisan. This is something that is very fueled by a desire on the part of big funders of the right to basically have the government do its bidding. It's not just financial. I mean, it is all the other issues \u2014 the civil rights and human rights and labor rights and everything that I was trying to defend in this past election. I want to talk with you about Russia. Hmm. Please. [Laughs] There was never an election like this one with Russian interference. And we continue to find out more, just about every day about what the Russians did. It was recently reported that in addition to the hacking of the DNC and John Podesta's email in addition to creating and pushing out fake news, Russia created fake affinity groups on Facebook, which tried to organize anti-immigration rallies, anti-Muslim rallies. What questions to do you have about what we don't know about what the Russians did? I think you're right that we've learned a lot. We've learned a lot since I closed out my manuscript at the end of June. And in my chapter on Russia I try to explain what we knew before the election and how we tried to sound the alarm. I had the leaders of my campaign going to the press and saying, \"Look, Watergate was a physical break-in. This was a cyberattack, to steal information, to weaponize it.\" So we knew before the election that the Russians were playing hard and we knew from what we heard \u2014 You know before the election? Oh yes. You don't mean before the campaign, just before the \u2014 Well, I knew about it starting in late spring of 2016 going into the summer, and then we began to pick up clues. Like, for example, we later learned in September that our intelligence community, led by the director of national intelligence, Jim Clapper; the director of the CIA, John Brennan, had concluded that there was a campaign of disinformation, a cyber campaign against my campaign, against me, and it was meant to discredit me, defeat me if they could, and to help Trump. So we were picking up clues all the time. I didn't have access to all of the secret information, but there was an interesting moment in late August, early September when Harry Reid wrote a public letter to Jim Comey at the FBI, saying, \"We are hearing a lot\" \u2014 and we later learned it was because Harry had been briefed and he didn't reference all of the classified material \u2014 but he said, \"We're hearing a lot in the press and elsewhere that there is an investigation going on of Trump and his associates and their involvement with Russia and Russia's involvement with the campaign. Would you verify that?\" Comey never would. Then on Oct. 7, in the morning, Jeh Johnson at Homeland Security and Jim Clapper said, \"There is a threat to our election.\" That was the same day that the Hollywood Access tape came out. Within one hour the Russians \u2014 through their cutouts at WikiLeaks \u2014 dropped the Podesta emails. The Podesta emails that they had hacked. So you think the timing was intentional \u2014 Absolutely. To distract \u2014 They were holding them, in my opinion \u2014 To distract from the Access Hollywood video? They may not have known about that specific video, but something was going to happen, because Trump was a bit of a loose cannon, and they were going to intervene. Remember, go back to August, and Roger Stone, one of Trump's associates, was tweeting, Oh it's going to be John Podesta's turn in the barrel, and all of that. So we knew that there was some kind of communication going on, because it would take people in the American political system, and in this campaign particularly, to say, \"Drop the WikiLeaks now. Get them out there. Because we can distract the press from the really horrible video of Trump admitting to sexual assault.\" That's exactly what they did, and the press fell for it. So you had wall-to-wall coverage of the Hollywood Access tape \u2014 What do you think the press could've done? I think the press could've said \u2014 I mean, once the information is out there, it's going to be reported on. What would you have liked to see the press have done? What I would like to have seen is, \"You know what? These were stolen emails ...\" Every story should start with, \"These were stolen emails, and the best judgment from our intelligence professionals and independent analysts is they were stolen by Russia. And they were stolen for a purpose and they are clearly meant to kind of prevent any more attention on Trump's bad behavior.\" And to be like shiny objects all over the place, waving in front of people, and to be weaponized \u2014 to go back to the point you were making \u2014 to be weaponized into negative stories that then could be posted on right-wing sites and be covered on Russia TV and then can migrate to Fox News and Breitbart and Facebook and everything else. That's exactly what happened. In the last month of the campaign, Trump mentioned WikiLeaks 160 times. Why? Because they were making up stuff 24/7. You told Susan Page at USA Today that you believe that the Trump campaign colluded with the Russians. What leads you to believe that? I was careful with that. I said we know they communicated. We know they tried to hide all of the communications \u2014 both phone calls and meetings. We know that they took advantage of very well-timed Russian activities. We know that they had a very clear line of communication that was set up, that, in fact, after the election, the Trump people wanted to continue \u2014 and not in the sight of our intelligence providers. We know that the intelligence community of our country \u2014 people who I've worked with, people who I have every bit of confidence in \u2014 have concluded that this came from the top of the Kremlin and was intended to help Trump. We know there were all these financial entanglements. We're learning more all the time. There's just communication, there's financial, there's a lot of breadcrumbs and trails that are now being investigated. It's up to the special counsel, the Congress to determine what the facts are, but there's just a lot of smoke there. You've basically said that you thought the Comey comments about the email investigation is what tipped the election. Yeah. And ultimately caused you to lose. But you've also said the Russian bots and Facebook pages and affinity groups and the hacking all contributed to your loss. Yes. I believe that. Democrats have said that they think there was Russian interference in the election, but that they're not challenging the results of the election. As more and more information comes out about the depth of Russia's interference in the election, do you think, at some point, that it would be legitimate to challenge the legitimacy of the election? I don't know if there's any legal constitutional way to do that. I think you can raise questions. In fact, I think part of the reason Trump behaves the way he behaves is that he is a walking example of projection. Whatever he's doing and whatever he thinks is happening he will accuse somebody else of. And there are examples during the campaign when he did just that, like when he called publicly on Russia to hack my personal emails. He knew they were trying to do whatever they could to discredit me with emails, so there's obviously a trail there, but I don't know that in our system we have any means of doing that, but I just wanted to add to the point you made. There's no doubt they influenced the election: We now know more about how they did that. Let me just put it this way, if I had lost the popular vote but won the Electoral College and in my first day as president the intelligence community came to me and said, \"The Russians influenced the election,\" I would've never stood for it. Even though it might've advantaged me, I would've said, \"We've got to get to the bottom of this.\" I would've set up an independent commission with subpoena power and everything else.  I want to get back to the question, would you completely rule out questioning the legitimacy of this election if we learn that the Russian interference in the election is even deeper than we know now? No. I would not. I would say \u2014 You're not going to rule it out. No, I wouldn't rule it out. So what are the means, like, this is totally unprecedented in every way \u2014 It is. What would be the means to challenge it, if you thought it should be challenged? Basically I don't believe there are. There are scholars, academics, who have arguments that it would be, but I don't think they're on strong ground. But people are making those arguments. I just don't think we have a mechanism. You know, the Kenya election was just overturned and really what's interesting about that \u2014 and I hope somebody writes about it, Terry \u2014 the Kenyan election was also a project of Cambridge Analytica, the data company owned by the Mercer family that was instrumental in the Brexit vote. There's now an investigation going on in the U.K., because of the use of data and the weaponization of information. They were involved in the Trump campaign after he got the nomination, and I think that part of what happened is Mercer said to Trump, \"We'll help you, but you have to take Bannon as your campaign chief. You've got to take Kellyanne Conway and these other people who are basically Mercer prot\u00e9g\u00e9s.\" And so we know that there was this connection. So what happened in Kenya, which I'm only beginning to delve into, is that the Supreme Court there said there are so many really unanswered and problematic questions, we're going to throw the election out and redo it. We have no such provision in our country. And usually we don't need it. Now, I do believe we should abolish the Electoral College, because I was sitting listening to a report on the French election and the French political analyst said, \"You know in our country the person with the most votes wins, unlike in yours.\" And I think that's an anachronism. I've said that since 2000. I want to ask you about Comey and the email investigation. Comey has said that he felt he needed publicly to say that the FBI was investigating your email server to protect the credibility of the investigation, after your husband spoke with then-head of the Justice Department Loretta Lynch, when their planes were on the tarmac together, and your husband went over to her plane and chatted with her. I have no idea what they said, but it raised the question of conflict of interest and she was overseeing the investigation into the emails. So you paid a big price for that chat \u2014 we don't know what the outcome of the investigation would've been had it not been for that chat. So in assessing what went wrong with your campaign and with the election results, how much do you trace back to Bill Clinton's conversation with Loretta Lynch, and is that something you talk to him about? by Hillary Rodham Clinton Hardcover, 494 pages | Your purchase helps support NPR programming. How? You know Terry, I think it was a phony rationalization by Comey for the following reasons: Both Loretta Lynch and Bill immediately said they talked about grandchildren; there was no subject raised that had any legal significance. That's No. 1. No. 2: There's a chain of command in the Department of Justice. The deputy attorney general, Sally Yates, who I think people recognize as an incredibly experienced woman with great integrity, was next in line. So there was no reason why Comey could not have gone up the chain, which was what the protocol required. So he could've gone to Sally Yates if he thought, \"OK, I don't want to put Loretta Lynch in this kind of awkward position, so she recuses herself, so I will go to Sally Yates.\" But I do give him credit for recognizing there was no case. Where I part company is when there is no case that is all that's supposed to be announced. He had to go and do a press conference and indict the entire State Department and how the State Department diplomats communicate, and I write about this in the book, and I try to be as dispassionate as possible. OK, so let's say, whatever his rationalization was, it ends on July 5, when he makes that, I thought, uncalled-for press conference. That's not my beef with him. We were doing fine after that. We had a great convention; I won all three debates. I was judged by every poll \u2014 public and private \u2014 as on my path to winning. Where I part company with him \u2014 and think he violated every rule in the book as an FBI director \u2014 was what he did on Oct. 28, because what he did then was to send a letter acting like he was reopening an investigation that had been closed to Congress, knowing it would be immediately leaked. And later on when asked, \"Well, weren't you also conducting an investigation into the Trump campaign and their connections with Russia?\" Yes. \"Well, why didn't you tell the American people that?\" Because it was too close to the election. I think the American people deserve to know there was an FBI investigation [into the Trump campaign's ties to Russia] that had started in early 2016 \u2014 Americans never knew that. And yet my emails, which he reinjected into the campaign at the very end, he could've handled \u2014 OK suppose he legitimately thought, again, from pressure, because remember Rudy Giuliani two days before the 28th said, \"Something big is gonna happen.\" He [Comey] could've said, \"I'm going to look at this.\" I would've said, \"Go ahead, look at it. I have nothing to hide. It's the same stuff you've already seen.\" But no, he injected himself, but he never said a word about the Russia investigation. I think what some people are trying to figure out about your book and your tour, your book tour, is how much of it is about trying to defend our democracy \u2014 which you think is under attack, both by Russia but also by part of the right wing in America \u2014 and how much of it is just self-justification, like you lost, you're angry, you're specifically angry at some people, and Russia, and, like, where is the line? And I think a lot of people [are] more comfortable with the part where it feels like you're defending American democracy and less comfortable where you feel like you're just in it to justify yourself and to say, \"I should've won, I did really win, and I'm really angry that I didn't.\" But I think they go hand in hand. Because I don't think you could know the story without me also saying, \"Look, I made mistakes\", and I talk about ... You do. All of the mistakes that I made, my campaign made, and I'm happy to acknowledge those, because that was part of the retrospective that I had to go through to write this book. I don't think you can understand what I am most worried about in defending democracy unless you follow along with what happened. So yes, I do think sexism and misogyny played a role, and it's not just about me \u2014 I make that clear. I think voter suppression played a much bigger role than people are acknowledging. That is not going away. I think Comey cost me the election, but it was aided and abetted by Russia, WikiLeaks and all the other things we've now found out about Russia. So take me out of the equation. I'm not running again. I'm not going to be on the ballot. So take me out of the equation and say, \"OK, the mistake she made, maybe we can learn from that, etc., etc. But what do we have to worry about?\" I think I do a very clear job of saying here are the things we need to worry about going forward. And I also try to say, \"Hey this is something that we all have a stake in.\" I am fundamentally optimistic about our country, but I am not naive, and I don't think we can change things unless we take it seriously. Just getting back for a second to the tarmac thing. Whether or not Comey was justified in his reaction, probably your husband shouldn't have gone onto that plane, right? You know what? I don't think either he or Loretta Lynch \u2014 they never thought about it. It never crossed their mind! They both said that. Of course they said, in retrospect, for people to blow it up and make all kinds of innuendo out of it, they would never have done it. They knew each other. Their planes were parked next to each other. They were exchanging pleasantries. I don't think my husband ever for a minute thought, \"Oh my gosh, how is this going to look?\" It never crossed his mind! And then obviously he and she wished it hadn't happened, because it was used to raise questions that \u2014 even if they had been legitimate \u2014 could've been handled in a different way. The thing with conflict of interest is it's about the appearance of conflict as much as it's about conflict, and that's one of the rules of journalism, the appearance of conflict is a conflict in and of itself. He [Comey] could've said, \"I'm really sorry the attorney general did this, and I'll take her at her word, nothing was said, but I ask her to recuse so I can go to the deputy attorney general.\" And he would've been told, \"You don't have a press conference when you're saying there's no case.\" You are the former head of the State Department. Yes. You're watching the State Department change dramatically under the Trump administration. What are you seeing that concerns you? Oh, so much, Terry. I mean, there is a misunderstanding at the most profound level about what the foreign service does, what our diplomats do, how well trained they are, the languages they speak and read, the abilities they have. They're not being utilized. They're not being respected. They are being ignored. And I think it's to the detriment of our country. Take North Korea: We have people who speak the language, who understand the history, who could be extremely helpful in trying to bring about the kind of intensive diplomatic effort that is needed with our allies. Instead we get the president tweeting out that he's going after South Korea. It makes no sense at all. I could give you many examples that are evidence of their misunderstanding and their disdain for the quality and the experience of people in the State Department. Thankfully, the Congress seems to have a better idea, because they did send a budget to slash the Department of State and USAID to the Congress, from the Trump administration, and in a bipartisan agreement they said, \"No, you don't understand what we know. We've been in Congress. We see what diplomats do. We travel and meet with ambassadors and others who are working in the field.\" So I'm hoping that the Congress will hold the line on the Department of State and that not as much damage as I feared will actually end up happening to the institution so that it's ready to be used again in the future. I think for anybody who is retiring, so to speak, or leaving any job they've had for a long period of time, you go through a bit of an identity crisis: \"Who am I now, now that I'm not doing this work?\" So you and your husband are both never going to run again for office. You've said you're out of the game. So you've written this book \u2014 you're back in the spotlight again, you're back talking about politics and the election \u2014 but that's not going to last forever. The book will come out, it will be read by the people who read it, and then you're going to go on with your life. Are you undergoing a bit of an identity crisis at all, knowing that there's a big part of your life that's behind you, and you have to invent what the next part is going to be? I'm really not, and that's in large measure because I'm not going to retire from being active in politics. I've started a new group called Onward Together. We are raising money to fund a lot of these new grass-roots groups that have sprung up since the election, to recruit candidates, train them, help them. I'm going to be supporting candidates. I have lots of requests for help already, which I obviously have put on the back burner until we get through the book. So I am not leaving politics. I am going to be involved the way I was before I ever ran for office, the very first time when I was a candidate. So I expect to be really active, and my voice, I'm going to keep out there. [Laughs] I'm not going to just go slowly and quietly into that good night, because I believe and that's \u2014 as you have said, earlier in the interview \u2014 key to why I wrote this book. I think we are at a very threatening crossroads in our country, and I have said and I will say it again, I think this administration and their allies in Congress and their allies on the outside pose a clear and present danger to our nation. So I'm not going to sit by and let that happen, if I have anything to do with it. Have you seen President Trump since he was inaugurated? I only saw him on Inauguration Day, and I write about that and what a surreal experience it was. But no communication since then? Except the way he tweets at me from time to time. Right, and do you read those tweets? Or do people tell you about them? People tell me about them, and about this book he tweeted the other night \"inaccurate,\" and all of that stuff. So I tweeted back at him this morning \u2014 because I have a children's book that also came out at the same time, it's a children's version of It Takes A Village \u2014 so I tweeted back, \"If you didn't like this book, how bout reading this one? Because it talks about how you solve problems together. So I take it kind of lightheartedly. I never know quite what he's trying to achieve other than feeding his base, which he uses his Twitter account for. Hillary Clinton, thank you so much for talking with us. Thank you. Thank you, Terry. I enjoyed it. Thank you. Sam Briger and Mooj Zadie produced and edited the audio of this interview. Bridget Bentz, Molly Seavy-Nesper and Martina Stewart adapted it for the Web.",

In the days since he blamed the fatal violence in Charlottesville, Va., on people on \"both sides\" of the confrontation, Trump has been rebuked by key senators from his own party and deserted by members of his business advisory boards, (which he then said he disbanded). The mayor of Phoenix has asked the president to delay a planned visit. The entire membership of the President's Committee on the Arts and Humanities has resigned, and Trump himself has decided not to attend the annual Kennedy Center Honors gala and not to hold the traditional gathering for the honorees at the White House. By week's end, the president had also parted ways with chief strategist Steve Bannon, who had run Trump's campaign for the presidency last fall. Bannon had described himself as pleased with the president's handling of Charlottesville and his defense of Confederate statues. Race \u2014 a subtext of American life My forebears were Confederates. ... But my very stomach turned over when I learned that Negro soldiers just back from overseas were being dumped out of Army trucks in Mississippi and beaten. President Harry Truman Race has been not only a recurring theme of American history but a subtext for much of our national life. The issue of slavery nearly broke up the convention that wrote the Constitution in 1787. It dominated debates in Congress for decades culminating in the Civil War in 1861. The treatment of former slaves and their descendants has roiled the social and political life of the nation ever since, forcing even presidents to examine their own hearts and question their own beliefs. In some cases, the issue has engulfed a presidency, such as that of Abraham Lincoln, the Civil War president who held the Union together and issued the Emancipation Proclamation. More often, it has been in the background, as when Virginia-born Woodrow Wilson had a private White House screening of the 1915 film Birth of a Nation with scenes vilifying African-Americans and glorifying the Ku Klux Klan. President Harry Truman was also a hereditary southerner, born in rural Missouri. But in the summer of 1948, Truman issued an executive order integrating the armed services: \"It is hereby declared to be the policy of the President that there shall be equality of treatment and opportunity for all persons in the armed services without regard to race, color, religion or national origin.\" Southern Democrats were incensed and many would bolt the party that summer and fall, voting in November for the States' Rights Party candidate Strom Thurmond. Truman, however, stood his ground. \"My forebears were Confederates,\" he replied. \"But my very stomach turned over when I learned that Negro soldiers just back from overseas were being dumped out of Army trucks in Mississippi and beaten.\" Truman's successor, President Dwight Eisenhower, grew up in Kansas and Texas and spent much of his life in the Army. He was not a fan of the 1954 Supreme Court decision against school segregation. But three years later, when nine Arkansas teenagers tried to integrate Little Rock Central High School in the face of an angry mob, President Eisenhower took up their cause. Ike sent the legendary 101st Airborne Division to ensure that the students got through the jeering demonstrators. Delivering a then-rare televised address from the White House, Eisenhower said: \"Our personal opinions have no bearing on the matter of enforcement; the responsibility and authority of the Supreme Court to interpret the Constitution are very clear.\" Civil rights movement versus resistance The civil rights movement gained momentum through the late 1950s into the early 1960s, but resistance remained in high places. The governor of Alabama, George Wallace, made his political name with his vow to enforce \"segregation now, segregation tomorrow and segregation forever.\" In 1963, he stood literally \"in the schoolhouse door\" to block a black student's enrollment in the University of Alabama. President John F. Kennedy had walked a careful line between civil rights enforcement and the sentiments of Southern Democrats (Wallace was still a Democrat at the time). But in this instance he nationalized state guardsmen and took to TV in much the manner of Ike, six years earlier. \"I hope that every American, regardless of where he lives, will stop and examine his conscience about this,\" Kennedy said. \"This nation was founded ... on the principle that all men are created equal, and that the rights of all men are diminished when the rights of one man are threatened.\" But when Kennedy was assassinated five months later, it fell to his successor, Lyndon B. Johnson, to enact the civil rights legislation that had languished in Congress for decades. Johnson, a southerner from Texas, would sign the Civil Rights Act into law in 1964 and win that fall's election in a landslide. But the following year he was concerned his agenda of Medicare, Medicaid and Great Society programs would suffer if he pressed too hard for a successor bill on voting rights. Events in Selma and Montgomery, Ala., forced his hand, however, and he went to Congress in March to demand action on what became the Voting Rights Act. \"As a man whose roots go deep into Southern soil, I know how agonizing racial feelings are,\" Johnson said, but he made it clear he was tired of hearing the old arguments and obfuscations. \"The command of the Constitution is plain. There is no moral issue. It is wrong \u2014 deadly wrong \u2014 to deny any of your fellow Americans the right to vote in this country.\" \"A More Perfect Union\" In more recent times, we have seen our first African-American president struggle with the burden of racism and seemingly overcome it. Perhaps, Barack Obama's most famous speech of 2008 came in March of that year, after his association with an outspoken and controversial preacher threatened to derail his campaign. He titled the speech \"A More Perfect Union\" in tribute to Lincoln, and at one point the biracial Obama said he could \"no more disown my pastor than I can disown my own white grandmother, a woman who helped raise me, a woman who sacrificed again and again for me,\" but who also confessed her fear of black men she doesn't know on the street. As president, Obama tried to confront the racial element of the gun violence that often dominated the news. One victim whose death resonated with the nation was Trayvon Martin, a black teenager in Florida shot by a self-appointed watchman in a gated community. \"Trayvon Martin could have been me 35 years ago,\" the president said. \"If I had a son, he'd look like Trayvon.\" Later in his time in office, after a spate of police shootings of young black men, five Dallas policemen were killed by a sniper during an otherwise peaceful rally. \"We ask our police to do too much and ourselves to do too little,\" a saddened Obama said. \"It's as if the deepest fault lines of our democracy have suddenly been exposed, perhaps even widened.\" Race was surely a special preoccupation for Obama. But it has been a source of continuing discomfort \u2014 and at times excruciating conflict \u2014 for presidents since the nation was born. \"A house divided against itself cannot stand,\" said Lincoln, almost 160 years ago. And all who preceded or followed him in office have known something of the weight of that challenge.",

Updated: 2:19 p.m. ET By all accounts, President Trump did not win the Asian-American vote in 2016. But the size of Hillary Clinton's margin of victory with voters in the fastest-growing racial group in the U.S. depends upon which exit poll you rely. The National Exit Poll, funded by the major national media organizations, shows that Clinton won roughly two-thirds (65 percent) of Asian-American votes, while Trump received just over a quarter (27 percent), according to pollsters at Edison Research. Asian-American support for Clinton was even more pronounced, though, in exit polling by the Asian American Legal Defense and Education Fund, or AALDEF, which provided NPR a preview of its latest report. According to AALDEF's poll, Clinton's support was closer to winning four-in-five Asian-American voters (79 percent) with just 18 percent for Trump. The difference in the results lies, in large part, because of how the polling was conducted. AALDEF surveyed close to 14,000 Asian-American voters, more than 14 times the number of Asian-American participants in Edison Research's poll. While Edison Research conducted polling in English and Spanish, AALDEF used questionnaires written in English and 11 Asian languages including Chinese, Bengali, Korean, Tagalog, and Vietnamese, plus volunteers who could speak 23 Asian languages and dialects. Similar to a Latino Decisions exit poll of Hispanic voters, the wider sample and the wider variety of languages likely means the AALDEF exit poll is more accurate. At 18 percent, Trump fared slightly worse with the Asian-American vote than Mitt Romney, who won 21 percent in 2012, and John McCain, who won 23 percent in 2008, according to previous exit polling by AALDEF. But the Republican-Democratic split last year remained fairly similar compared to those of the last two presidential elections, proving once again that Asian-Americans as a whole vote for Democratic candidates in national elections. Clinton received her strongest support from South Asian-American voters, including those of Pakistani, Bangladeshi, Indo-Caribbean and Indian descent. A greater share of Asian-American Republican voters (20 percent) did cross party lines to vote for the Democratic candidate compared to 2012 (13 percent) and 2008 (17 percent). Trump also saw a drop in support from Vietnamese-American voters, historically a base of Republican support among the Asian-American electorate. While 54 percent supported Romney and 67 percent supported McCain, Trump only won 32 percent of the Vietnamese-American vote. Jerry Vattamala, who runs AALDEF's exit polling, attributes these shifts to Trump's campaign rhetoric targeting immigrants and Muslims. \"There was a big departure from the established party stances on policies that have been in place for decades. Then, there was the specific targeting of Asian countries like China,\" said Vattamala, director of AALDEF's democracy program. Still, while Clinton received the majority of votes among Asian-Americans born in and outside of the U.S., Trump received a greater share of votes from foreign-born voters (22 percent) than from those born in the U.S. (8 percent). It's a sign of the nuances within a diverse and growing voting group that, Vattamala says, saw unprecedented outreach efforts from presidential campaigns last year despite its relatively small size compared to other racial groups. Support from Asian-Americans has been a challenge for the Republican Party and could continue to be so in the coming years. Trump won an Electoral College victory last November, but lost the popular vote. Asian-Americans preferred Clinton by a 2-1 margin. Looking ahead, the economy and jobs are the most important issues Asian-American voters want the Trump administration and Congress to work on. The exit poll also found that a majority supports stricter gun-control laws; an overhaul of immigration laws that includes a path to citizenship; and laws protecting LGBT people from discrimination in employment, housing and public accommodations. (A fissure point among Asian-American voters was a question about police accountability, which drew the sharpest divisions between different ethnic and age groups.) \"The parties and candidates will be well served to make sure that the voters are being treated in a fair way and having their needs addressed,\" Vattamala says. \"Especially in these swing states and in close races, Asian-Americans can very well be the difference in who wins and who loses.\"",

            "article_content": "President Obama's final press conference was one of both reflection and subtle rebuke toward incoming President-elect Donald Trump, defending voting rights and a free press, all while reassuring the American people that \"at my core, I think we're going to be OK.\" Obama did show some deference toward Trump \u2014 sidestepping a question about the more than five dozen Democrats in Congress who are boycotting the inauguration on Friday. \"All I know is I'm going to be there, and so is Michelle,\" he said. And striking an upbeat tone at the end, Obama maintained that despite being disappointed that Democrat Hillary Clinton hadn't won, there shouldn't be dread ahead. \"The only thing that is the end of the world is the end of the world,\" Obama said, quoting advice he had given his own daughters after the election. \"I believe in this country. I believe in the American people. I believe that people are more good than bad,\" Obama said. But he did have some advice for his successor, warning Trump not to become isolated in the Oval Office and to rely on his advisers. \"This is a job of such magnitude that you can't do it by yourself,\" the president said. \"You are enormously reliant on a team.\" And Obama said that while it was appropriate for the incoming Republican administration to make shifts in policy, he also warned that, \"if you're going to make big shifts in policy, just make sure you've thought it through.\" Obama said his post-presidential plans including wanting \"to be quiet a little bit and not hear myself talk so darn much.\" But he did say there would be issues he wouldn't hesitate to speak out on after he leaves office, if he believes the country's \"core values may be at stake.\" Obama said that would include \"systematic discrimination being ratified in some fashion,\" an assault on voting rights, \"institutional efforts to silence dissent or the press\" and \"efforts to round up kids who have grown up here and, for all practical purposes, are American kids, and send them someplace else.\" Obama greatly defended the rights of a free press, seeming to be directly addressing tensions between the press corps and the incoming administration, which has floated moving reporters out of the White House and denying credentials to some reporters or publications. Obama acknowledged that at times he hasn't been pleased with some of his coverage, but he told reporters that \"America needs you, and our democracy needs you.\" \"You're not supposed to be sycophants,\" Obama said. \"You're supposed to be skeptics; you're supposed to ask me tough questions.\" But the subject on which Obama grew most passionate and the most defensive was the issue of voting rights. \"This whole notion of voting fraud is something that has been constantly disproved,\" the president said forcefully. \"This is fake news.\" He argued there was a racial component to such efforts \u2014 \"The reason that we're the only country that makes it harder to vote is that it traces exactly back to Jim Crow\" \u2014 but did also argue that while racial issues have gotten better during his presidency, \"we've got more work to do on race.\" Obama also expressed hope that there would be more diverse chief executives to follow him in the White House, along with another black president. \"I think we're going to see people of merit rise up from every race, faith and corner of the country,\" he said. \"We're going to have a woman president, a Latino president, a Jewish president, a Hindu president.\" And he praised the \"transformation\" that has taken place over LGBT rights over the past decade and said he was proud that his administration in some places had \"provided a good block downfield to help the movement advance.\" Obama said that while he knew there would be challenges, he was hopeful those advancements weren't \"reversible, because American society has changed [and] the attitudes of young people in particular have changed.\" He also defended some of his final moves in office, including the controversial decision on Tuesday to commute Chelsea Manning's 35-year prison sentence. The president said that the Army private, who was convicted of leaking secret military information to WikiLeaks, had served a \"tough prison sentence\" and that 35 years was \"very disproportionate\" relative to sentences given to individuals in other similar cases. As for the U.S.'s decision last month to abstain from a U.N. Security Council vote that eventually passed condemning Israeli settlements on the West Bank, Obama said that the status quo in the region was \"unacceptable.\" \"I don't see how this issue gets resolved in a way that maintains Israel as both Jewish and a democracy,\" the president said. \"Because if you do not have two states, then in some form or fashion you are extending an occupation; functionally, you end up having one state in which millions of people are disenfranchised and operate as second-class residents.\"",

            "article_content": "Shelly Fields is a 46-year-old white woman living in Richton Park, a racially diverse Chicago suburb. She says she's raised her four daughters, who are biracial, to see people of all races as equal, just as her parents raised her. Fields doesn't think that racism will ever disappear completely, but she's hopeful that it lessens with each passing generation. \"The more biracial children there are, the more equality we see,\" Fields said. \"The more people of color we see in positions of power \u2013 it will help to change the way people see race.\" Her oldest daughter, Summer, is a 22-year-old graduate of the University of Chicago. When she was in high school, Summer probably would have agreed that race relations were looking up. The '90s and early 2000s were \"a post-racial fantasy time\" in Richton Park, Summer said. \"Being firmly in the middle of the Obama era \u2013 it [was] a moment of progress. It was validating.\" Now, as the Obama era ends, she is of the mind that racism isn't going anywhere. \"Racism always evolves, and will find a way,\" Summer said. The question that Shelly and Summer are tackling has been posed in many forms for many generations. Will racism just die off with old bigots? Does the fate of race relations lie with the children? That idea has been milling about the public psyche for generations. It lives in that famous (if oft-decontextualized) line: \"I have a dream that my four little children will one day live in a nation where they will not be judged by the color of their skin but by the content of their character.\" Martin Luther King, Jr. said it eloquently in his \"I Have a Dream\" speech, but we've heard that sentiment through the ages, from Thomas Jefferson to Oprah Winfrey. The belief that our children's generation will be less racist gets repeated by teachers, parents, politicians and activists. And understandably so. Much of American culture is predicated on the idea that we can create a better future for our progeny, instilling in them values that we as a nation have often failed to uphold. Shelly and Summer Fields.\n                \n                    \n                    Courtesy of Summer Fields\n                    \n                \nhide caption Shelly and Summer Fields. In our small, very unscientific survey last month, Code Switch heard that conviction. We also heard just the opposite. We wanted to know if beliefs about the future of racism were held consistently in families from generation to generation. Here's what we asked in our December callout: Will racism fade away when old bigots die? Of the 120 or so people who responded, more than two-thirds said they did not think the next generation would usher out racism. And nearly the same number thought their answer would differ from their parents or grandparents. (There's reason to think, given some more scientific national research, that there's not really much difference between generations when it comes to racial beliefs.) But let's get back to the Fields family. Summer Fields responded to our survey. She had no qualms saying that racism would be with us for the long run. She didn't know exactly what her mom would say, but she was pretty sure it wouldn't be that. Here's what Shelly said: \"The further we get away from the idea that one skin color or race is better than the other, the better. Past generations had these ideas, and they were spread to the next generation and the next.\" Shelly learned about race from her parents. When she was growing up, she said, they taught her never to judge other people based on skin color. That didn't stop them from being cautious when she began dating outside her race and eventually decided to start a family with a black man. \"Once [my mother] found out I was pregnant, when it hit close to home, it was a different story,\" Shelly said. \"She was afraid ... She said, 'You're gonna have a baby with dark skin and kinky hair.' \"'She was afraid because she didn't know [what to expect]. And I really didn't know either.\" But Shelly said that once her daughters were born, her parents were able to see firsthand that there was nothing to worry about. (She lives right behind her parents, and they've been heavily involved in each other's lives.) She said that her neighborhood has always been racially mixed, and that her family has never really experienced racism there. That, she said, helped her parents move past some of their fears and double down on their belief that people of all races should be treated equally. \"They taught that to my daughters,\" Shelly said. \"They and I showed my daughters, and I'm hoping that they'll show their daughters and sons.\" Summer isn't quite as hopeful. As a high schooler, being surrounded by a mix of black, white, and multiracial classmates, it was possible for her to believe in a more uplifting future. After arriving at the University of Chicago, where less than five percent of the student body was black, her perspective changed. She started learning about things like race theory in her classes. The overwhelmingly white environment also affected how she thought of herself; her identity suddenly felt more political. She found herself engaging and disagreeing more with her mom's ideas about race. They've argued over things like trigger warnings and safe spaces (her mom says that's not how the real world works) and about how to self-identify. Summer thought of herself as biracial until she went to college. When she started referring to herself as a black woman, that became another point of contention. \"My mom doesn't understand,\" she said. \"She feels like that's an affront to her.\" While Shelly knows racism won't disappear (\"We still have families that teach the same things they were taught about judging people based on race,\" she said,) she holds onto some optimism. Summer's prognosis is a little bleaker. \"Our country's whole identity is founded on the pillaging and murder of Native people and chattel slavery,\" she said. It would help to acknowledge that, she said. She's just not sure democracy could handle it. \"For us to call that out and admit it would be the first step,\" Summer said. \"But it would destroy the whole project.\" That generational dissonance seemed to be a common thread among the people we surveyed. We heard from a South Asian college student in Florida who said that because her parents chose to come to the United States, they're more invested in the notion that America is a land of opportunity for all people. So they don't get why so many people of color in this country fear police or don't work their way out of poverty. My mom isn't racist ... but she doesn't understand institutional racism. I have an understanding of [American] history that my parents don't. University of Florida student \"My mom isn't racist ... but she doesn't understand institutional racism,\" she said. \"I have an understanding of [American] history that my parents don't.\" We also heard from a white elementary school teacher in New Jersey who's hopeful because his white students idolize musicians and athletes of color. But he said his parents think the culture gaps between races are too large to ever overcome. At one point, he spoke to them about moving from his largely white neighborhood into one that was racially mixed. He thought he'd be comfortable there. Their response? \"No, you wouldn't.\" Much of the available public polling data suggests that millennials like the schoolteacher are not as different from Generation Xers or Baby Boomers as they might think. Kathleen Weldon, communications director at the Roper Center for Public Opinion Research at Cornell University, said millennials tend to say they are more optimistic about race relations than their parents, and more broadly accepting of things like interracial friendships and marriage. But when questioned about specific policy issues tied to race, she said, millennials sound a lot like their elders. They don't \"have different views on the [George] Zimmerman case, aren't more aware of the disproportionate effect of HIV on the black community, are not more likely to think government should play a major role in the social and economic position of blacks, and are no more [or less] likely to think the [Voting Rights Act] is still necessary,\" Weldon said. \"In other words, when it comes to perceptions and policy around race in the U.S., young Americans don't look much different from older ones.\" Jocelyn Wilks and her father, Elijah, expected their views to diverge significantly when it came to race and racism. But though they come from different generations, were born in different parts of the country, and even have different ideas of what they'll call racism, their outlook is pretty similar. As a black man born in Mississippi in the early 1960s, Elijah lived with state-sponsored racism. He was in fourth grade when his school integrated. When he was in high school, there was a black homecoming court and a white homecoming court, a black \"Mr. and Miss High School\" and a white \"Mr. and Miss High School.\" Jocelyn and Elijah Wilks\n                \n                    \n                    Courtesy of Jocelyn Wilks\n                    \n                \nhide caption Jocelyn and Elijah Wilks Those experiences inform his thinking about race. His daughter, he said, formed her opinions another way. \"I've never taught [Jocelyn] about racism,\" Elijah said. \"I never had those conversations with her. I let her grow up and develop her own opinion of things. That was never taught in the home when I was growing up and I didn't teach her that way.\" Another difference between father and daughter, he said, is geographic. He was raised in Mississippi; Jocelyn was born and raised in San Antonio. \"Where I grew up, you were either black or white,\" Elijah said. \"In San Antonio, it's predominantly Hispanic, and whites and blacks are minorities ... It makes a huge difference.\" Jocelyn is a 28-year-old accounting student who lives just north of San Antonio. Her experience teaching pre-school helped convince her that racism was going nowhere fast. During that time, Jocelyn heard a lot of nonsense from her students, like one boy who, after losing a basketball game, said his opponent's \"genes were made to jump.\" Jocelyn knew the children were getting those ideas from somewhere. \"When you're 9 or 10 you can't call bullshit on your parents,\" she said. \"You take those racist statements as facts. ... \"Kids pick up things that you don't teach them. So if Mom treats a person of color poorly, the kid sees that and picks it up, because that's their model.\" Jocelyn said she and her dad have different ideas of what's worth labeling racism. Born in a harsher time, his threshold, she said, is higher. \"It won't be the small slights that people in my generation find to be racist,\" she said. \"He thinks things are getting better, and they are better from when he was growing up. But it's not the better that we're looking for. He wouldn't look at gentrification or housing segregation and say, 'They're doing that on purpose, this is racist.' It would be a church shooting, and he'd [say], 'That's a hate crime.' \"Dad says, 'It's not fair that these people are getting killed and no one's going to jail for it.' And I say, 'It's not fair, if your name is Shaniqua, that you have to work 15 times harder to get a job than anybody else.'\" But when they come back to that question that has been passed down through the generations \u2013 Will racism fade away when old bigots die? \u2013 Elijah and Jocelyn sound almost identical. Father: \"As new generations come into existence, it will be lesser and lesser, but I don't know if it will ever end.\" Daughter: \"As long as there's racism in this generation, there's going to be racism in the next generation. It might dwindle, but it won't disappear.\"",

But this substantial chapter in American history comes to a close on Sunday. After years of declining ticket sales and seemingly endless conflicts with animal rights groups, Ringling Bros. will stage its final show in Uniondale, N.Y. Ringmaster Johnathan Lee Iverson is one of hundreds of Ringling performers and crew members with extraordinary talents who will be out of a job come Monday. Recruited fresh out of college, where he'd been studying voice performance and training to be a professional opera singer, he became Ringling's first African-American ringmaster in 1998. The overwhelming majority of bats are friends of humanity. They gobble up the insects that bite us and ruin our crops. They pollinate flowers and they replant forests by spreading seeds around. But as agriculture overtakes rain forests and jungles, humans have come into conflict with one bat species: the common vampire bat. In Latin America, vampire bats drink the blood of livestock. Very rarely, these bats contract rabies. Before they die, they can spread the deadly virus to pigs, chickens, cows \u2014 and even humans. The disease costs farmers in Latin America $30 million every year andkills dozens of people. In March of this year, a man in Brazil reportedly died of rabies after being bitten by a vampire bat. Ranchers, whose livelihoods are threatened, want the government to wipe out this threat. But is extermination the best course of action? Would the world be better without vampire bats? Is there anything that makes them worth saving? In 2011, state lawmakers began the Indiana Choice Scholarship Program, a plan to allow low-income students to use vouchers, paid for with public school dollars, to attend private, generally religious schools. Now the state's private school voucher program is the largest of its kind in the U.S. Public schools are required to accept all students, regardless of disability. Voucher schools are not. In many cases, it's not the students who choose the schools but the schools that choose the students. Whether voucher programs are \"social justice\" or \"an assault\" on public schools depends on whom you ask.

The NAACP \u2014 which at 108 years old must balance both its storied legacy as the nation's oldest civil rights group and the potential for irrelevance amid a fresh wave of racial justice groups born of social media such as Black Lives Matter \u2014 decided to shake things up a bit on Saturday. The organization announced its new president and CEO and its intention to alter its tax status to a non-profit category that permits more aggressive political lobbying. Forty-nine-year-old Derrick Johnson is familiar not only with the organization but also with the post he was unanimously elected to Saturday for a three-year term. Johnson had served as interim president and CEO since July. In February, he had been elected as vice-chairman of the board of directors. Before that, he served as state president of the Mississippi State Conference of the NAACP. During a phone call with reporters, Johnson also said the NAACP's national office would soon transition from the 501(c)3 non-profit status it currently holds to become a 501(c)4. The change will lift significant restrictions on the NAACP's ability to engage in political lobbying. IRS rules permit political actions by 501(c)4 groups, though not as their \"primary activity.\" Speaking with reporters, Johnson said the decision was in line with one of his organization's top priorities: promoting candidates and issues in local and Congressional elections ahead of next year's midterms. He added that the change would also allow the NAACP to speak to the needs to African-Americans across the country in an increasingly political climate. The NAACP said in a statement that it chose Johnson believing he could help the organization reinvent itself to more vigorously respond to \"new threats to communities of color emerging daily and attacks on our democracy.\" After more than a century in operation, the NAACP continues to face questions about its ability to connect with a new generation of younger, more technologically savvy racial justice advocates. Black Lives Matter leader DeRay Mckesson said he had seen the NAACP's name recognition on the wane during protests in Ferguson, Mo. three years ago. \"There was a younger person than me who was, like, just budding 20. And he was like, what is NAACP? And we were, like, shocked,\" he told NPR's Hansi Lo Wang in July. Johnson told reporters Saturday that, while the organization doesn't disclose its membership count, its rolls have seen growth in the past two years. He has previously conceded, however, that the NAACP needs to draw more young members, specifically those between the ages of 21 and 35. The NAACP made headlines in August when it issued a travel advisory for the state of Missouri, saying visitors should \"show extreme caution.\" The organization had never before done so for a single state. The move was in response to a newly-passed state law that made discrimination lawsuits harder to win, as well as racial incidents at the University of Missouri and statistics indicating black drivers were significantly more likely to get pulled over. Johnson was interim president in August when a white supremacist rally in Charlottesville, Va. turned deadly and provoked an equivocal response from President Trump on the moral standing of protesters marching to defend a Confederate monument. \"We shouldn't have a president - we shouldn't have a country that tolerates this type of situation,\" he told NPR's Morning Edition at the time. \"We have lived through this. We should've learned from our history. And there's no reason for us to repeat this history again.\" Perhaps signaling his willingness to also perform activism over more contemporary mediums, Johnson responded to Trump via Twitter. When Trump gives permission for hate to thrive, this is what happens. Sick. #Charlottesville@NAACP",

The strike set in motion the modern farmworkers movement. At 87, Dolores Huerta is a living civil rights icon. She has spent most of her life as a political activist, fighting for better working conditions for farmworkers and the rights of the downtrodden, a firm believer in the power of political organizing to effect change. And yet, her role in the farmworkers movement has long been overshadowed by that of Cesar Chavez, her longtime collaborator and co-founder of what became the United Farm Workers of America union. That's true even when it comes to credit for coining the movement's famous slogan, S\u00ed se puede \u2014 Spanish for \"Yes, we can\" \u2014 which inspired President Obama's own campaign battle cry and has often wrongly been attributed to Chavez. (Obama acknowledged Huerta as the source of that phrase when he awarded her the Presidential Medal of Freedom in 2012. She talks about its origins below.) Dolores, a new documentary from director Peter Bratt, aims to finally set the record straight. The film chronicles Huerta's evolution from a teenager outraged by the racial and economic injustices she saw in California's agricultural Central Valley to a key architect of the nationwide boycott of grapes that led to the first farmworker union contracts. At its height, an estimated 17 million people stopped buying grapes. Huerta was 25 when she became the political director of the Community Service Organization, run by influential community organizer Fred Ross. That's where she met Chavez, and in 1962 the two teamed up to form what became the UFA, organizing farmworkers who toiled for wages as low as 70 cents an hour, in brutal conditions. \"They didn't have toilets in the fields, they didn't have cold drinking water. They didn't have rest periods,\" Huerta tells NPR. In 1965, the grape workers struck, and Huerta was a leading organizer. She faced violence on the picket lines \u2014 and sexism from both the growers she was staring down and their political allies, and from within her own organization. At one point, a lawmaker is seen referring to Huerta as Chavez's \"sidekick.\" At a time when the feminist movement was taking root, Huerta was an unconventional figure: the twice-divorced mother of 11 children. \"Who supports those kids when she's out on these adventures?\" one of her opponents is shown asking in historical footage. Now grown, her children provide some of the most moving accounts in the film. They speak with great admiration for their mother, but are also candid about the price her tireless dedication to the cause exacted on the family. As one daughter puts it, \"The movement became her most important child.\" Huerta organizes marchers in Coachella, Calif., in 1969. She's been an outspoken activist for the rights of farmworkers and the downtrodden for much of her life.\n                \n                    \n                    George Ballis//George Ballis/Take Stock/The Image Work\n                    \n                \nhide caption Huerta organizes marchers in Coachella, Calif., in 1969. She's been an outspoken activist for the rights of farmworkers and the downtrodden for much of her life. As she approaches nine decades of life, Huerta remains outspoken and indefatigable. Through her Dolores Huerta Foundation, she continues to work with agricultural communities, organizing people to run for office and advocating on issues of health, education and economic development. Huerta recently stopped by NPR headquarters in Washington, D.C., where she spoke to us about the new film, her life's work and her ongoing activism. Excerpts of our conversation are transcribed below, edited for brevity and clarity. After the grape workers went on strike, you directed the national boycott of grapes. What kind of day-to-day conditions did farmworkers in the field face at that time? Well, the conditions were terrible. The farmworkers were only earning about 70 cents an hour at that time \u2014 90 cents was the highest wage that they were earning. They didn't have toilets in the fields, they didn't have cold drinking water. They didn't have rest periods. People worked from sunup to sundown. It was really atrocious. And families were so poor. I think that's one of the things that really infuriated me. When I saw people in their homes \u2014 they had dirt floors. And the furniture was orange crates and cardboard boxes. People were so incredibly poor and they were working so hard. And the children were [suffering from malnutrition] and very ill-clothed and ill-fed. I said, \"This is wrong,\" because you saw how hard they were working, and yet they were not getting paid anything. One thing that struck me while watching the documentary was the violence directed against farmworkers during the strike. Were you subjected to this violence? Oh, many times. We had violence directed at us by the growers themselves, trying to run us down by cars, pointing rifles at us, spraying the people when they were on the picket line with sulfur. And then we had violence by the Teamsters union with the goons that they hired at that time \u2014 and by the way, I have to say that the Teamsters union are OK today. [Editor's note: In 1970, the Teamsters union signed a deal with growers for access to organize farmworkers, undercutting the efforts of the United Farm Workers.] They came at us with two by fours. We had a lot of violence, definitely. And then I was beaten up by the police San Francisco [in 1988], which also is shown in the film. [During that incident, several of her ribs were broken and her recovery took months.] In the documentary, we hear a lot of moving testimony from your children. And they obviously have a great deal of respect and admiration for you. But they also talk about the toll that the work took on the family when they were growing up. Was that something that weighed on you \u2014 the fact that you were very much a pioneer, but the time that you spent on activism meant time away from your children? I think that's something that all mothers have to deal with, especially single mothers. We work and we have to leave the kids behind. And I think that's one of the reasons that we, not only as women but as families, we have to advocate for early childhood education for all of our children. To make sure that they're taken care of but also educated in the process. Because we do need women in civic life. We do need women to run for office, to be in political office. We need a feminist to be at the table when decisions are being made so that the right decisions will be made. But you know, actually, in the farmworkers union \u2014 and the film doesn't really show this \u2014 we always had a daycare for children. Because when we did this strike, and especially when all of the people went on the march to Sacramento, the women had to take over the picket lines. Because the men were marching to Sacramento? Yeah, the women had to take over the strike. The women had to run all the picket lines. They had to do all the work that we were doing in the strike. Do you feel that women working in the fields faced special challenges when you were organizing? Oh absolutely, especially on the issue of pesticides. Because you know, the pesticides in the fields really affect women even more than they do men. They affect children and they affect women more than they do men. But we have had so many women that have cancer, so many children have been born with deformities. And men also that have died because they were spraying pesticides in the field and they died of lung cancer. This is a really, really big issue to this day for farmworkers. Because even though we were able to get many of the pesticides banned, they keep inventing new ones. And it was actually just a couple of months ago that a group of farmworkers working in a field near Bakersfield were poisoned. And one of the pesticides that affected them was one that was recently taken off the restricted list by President Trump. [Editor's note: The Environmental Protection Agency, under President Obama, had concluded that the pesticide chlorpyrifos could pose a risk to consumers and proposed banning it. But a final decision was not made until March, when the Trump administration's EPA reversed course and said it would keep the pesticide on the market.] One of things in the documentary that stayed with me is that you say that for a long time, you didn't think it was right to take credit for your work. You know what? I've thought about that a lot. When we had our first constitutional convention for the National Farm Workers Association and we were having elections and Cesar [Chavez] was running the meeting, he stepped down from the dais and came up to me. He said, \"Who's going to nominate you for vice president?\" And I said, \"Oh, I don't have to be on the board. I just want to serve all the women out there.\" How many of us have thought that way? And he said, \"You're crazy.\" So I did \u2014 I grabbed somebody to nominate me. But if Cesar hadn't told me to, I wouldn't have thought about it. And I think that's a problem with us as women \u2014 we don't think we need to be in the power structure, that we need to be on those boards where decisions are being made. Sometimes we think well, I'm not really prepared to take that position or that role. But I say [to women out there]: Just do it like the guys do it \u2014 pretend that you know. And then you learn on the job. The slogan \"S\u00ed se puede\" \u2014 \"Yes, we can\" \u2014 that was you. How did you come up with that? We were in Arizona. We were organizing people in the community to come to support us. They had passed a law in Arizona that if you said, \"boycott,\" you could go to prison for six months. And if you said \"strike,\" you could go to prison. So we were trying to organize against that law. And I was speaking to a group of professionals in Arizona, to see if they could support us. And they said, \"Oh, here in Arizona you can't do any of that. In Arizona no se puede \u2014 no you can't.\" And I said, \"No, in Arizona s\u00ed se puede!\" And when I went back to our meeting that we had every night there ... I gave that report to everybody and when I said, \"S\u00ed se puede,\" everybody started shouting, \"S\u00ed se puede! S\u00ed se puede!\" And so that became the slogan of our campaign in Arizona and now is the slogan for the immigrant rights movement, you know, on posters. We can do it. I can do it. S\u00ed se puede. That must make you smile every time you hear it. Oh, it does. I always feel very happy.",

I did. No, I always am responding and reacting. Sometimes I yell at the TV even.\" What happened But Trump is the one in the Oval Office, not Clinton, and she offers a series of explanations for what she did wrong, in the book and in her interviews with NPR. \"I take ultimate responsibility for the loss,\" Clinton said. \"I was the candidate. I was the person whose name was on the ballot. And I'll never get over that.\" There was the private email server she used for official business while secretary of state, a cloud that hung over her campaign from start to finish. \"It was a dumb mistake. I think it was a dumber scandal, but it hurt,\" she said. She also describes an inability to connect with the anger coursing through the electorate. \"I understood there was anger and fear and people were really unhappy because of what had happened in the financial crash. I understood all of that,\" Clinton said. \"What I didn't \u2014 and I say this in the book \u2014 I didn't really do well is conveying how much I understood of that, conveying how I got the despair and the anger.\" Clinton had plans \u2014 so many plans \u2014 for combating the opioid crisis, for helping people in coal country, for creating jobs through infrastructure spending and more. \"I talked about it, but I didn't really convey the emotional resonance,\" she said. While Trump was sending a signal to voters by talking about making America great again, bringing back coal jobs and building a wall, Clinton's detailed plans didn't break through. \"The amount of time and effort we spent not only devising the best infrastructure plan you could imagine but figuring out how it was gonna be paid for, nobody cared,\" she said. Meanwhile, she said, Trump tapped into something, even fed it. His message was \"discriminatory, it was bigoted, it was prejudiced,\" Clinton said. \"And yet it fed into part of the electorate that just wanted to have a primal scream. They didn't like what was going on. They wanted something different. They weren't interested in what you could actually do, because clearly Trump hasn't done very much that he said he would do. But they really responded to his racial and ethnic and sexist appeals.\" And while Trump started his campaign with a memorable line, Make America Great Again, Clinton said her team was headed into the general election trying to develop a theme that fit. \"I had three different very smart groups work independently, and I asked them, 'So what should be the theme of our general election?' And they each, amazingly, came up with the same slogan: 'Stronger Together.' Because what they argued, and what I believed, was that America does better when we're working together, when we're helping each other, when we're aiming toward a future of opportunity where we have broad-based economic growth that includes everybody, and where, yes, we stand up for human rights and civil rights,\" Clinton said. But, asked to choose her biggest regret, Clinton didn't look inward. \"Losing is my biggest regret,\" she said. \"And losing to someone who was not qualified and did not have the experience or the temperament to be president of the United States. That is my biggest regret.\" Clinton says her biggest regret from the 2016 presidential election is losing.\n                \n                    \n                    Adrienne Grunwald for NPR\n                    \n                \nhide caption Clinton says her biggest regret from the 2016 presidential election is losing. Clinton deflected the question of whether another Democrat could have beaten Trump, saying, \"Well, I don't think it's useful to speculate, because I was the nominee.\" What if Joe Biden had been the nominee? \"Well, he wasn't. And you know he ran in '08, and he didn't run in this this time \u2014 if he wants to run in the future, he can do that,\" she said. Comey, the Russians, voter suppression and other external forces In an election decided by fewer than 100,000 votes in three states, Clinton argues any number of factors could have decided the election. \"I was on the path to winning, and I felt great about the three debates,\" Clinton said when asked about issues of trust that dogged her campaign. \"And then unfortunately the Comey letter, aided in great measure by the Russian WikiLeaks, raised all those doubts again.\" Less than two weeks before the election, then-FBI Director James Comey told Congress that the bureau would be revisiting its investigation into the handling of classified information in connection with Clinton. On Nov. 6, he said a newly discovered trove of emails did not change the FBI's recommendation that Clinton not be charged. Nevertheless, Clinton has repeatedly placed blame on this sequence of events for undermining her candidacy at a crucial moment. WikiLeaks' release of thousands of emails allegedly tied to Clinton's campaign chairman, John Podesta, is another frequent target of hers. The documents disclosed internal campaign deliberation about Clinton's private email server and excerpts from her Wall Street speeches. The campaign linked the release to Russia. In the states Clinton lost, she argues voter ID requirements and other changes in the law made it harder for people who supported her to vote. \"In Wisconsin, Michigan, Pennsylvania, in particular, as well as North Carolina, there was a concerted effort to suppress the vote,\" she said, recounting anecdotes about people whose identification didn't qualify them to vote in Milwaukee. As for Russian interference in the election, Clinton thinks that in addition to the investigation being led by special counsel Robert Mueller, there should be an independent commission, like the 9/11 Commission. \"And if we don't come together as a country and with leadership from the White House and the Congress to combat it, to try to prevent it from happening again, we are really putting our democracy at risk,\" Clinton said. She has been following the twists and turns of the Russia investigations and devotes a chapter of her book to the topic. \"We're only now finding out what we did try to warn people about starting last summer,\" Clinton said. But back then those warnings were often dismissed as a campaign trying to distract from the damaging revelations from the WikiLeaks emails. \"And I think because it was so surreal \u2014 how, what do you mean the Russians are influencing our election? Now we know. Not only were they, they did. And not only did they, they will continue to do so.\" Talking about sexism and misogyny Clinton devotes a chapter of her book to being a woman in politics, and in conversations with NPR, she had a lot to say about it. Clinton said it is clear some share of the electorate \"is just not ready\" for a woman to be president. \"They just cannot imagine it, and they are resistant to it. And I want in this book to make it very clear that what happened to me was not just about me,\" Clinton said. There were some voters who said they were open to a woman as president, just not that woman, in reference to Clinton. But she doesn't buy that a different female candidate would have had it any easier. \"Look, if you think it's just about me, you don't have to deal with it. ... OK, I lost, you know? Have a nice time walking in the woods. But if you think it's endemic, as I believe it is, and that when a woman sticks her head up, she gets hit from both the right and the left by men who \u2014 primarily men \u2014 who do not want to accept the reality of a woman being a leader, an executive,\" Clinton said. Her reference to men on \"both the right and the left\" isn't without purpose. In the book she has harsh words for supporters of Bernie Sanders, so-called Bernie Bros, who intimidated her supporters online to the point that they hid their feelings in private Facebook groups. \"I want people to understand sexism and misogyny are real,\" Clinton said. \"They're real in business, they're real in politics, and people have to start standing up against it. And we have to equip young women to be able to ward it off and speak out, and we have to encourage men, particularly young men, not to buy into it. And we have to recognize there are deep stereotypes.\" As to the claim from some Sanders supporters that Clinton ran with a sense of entitlement, she said, \"I just totally reject that.\" Clinton called the criticism \"off base.\" Even after she clinched the nomination, she said, Sanders \"just kept going, and he and his followers' attacks on me kept getting more and more personal, despite him asking me not to attack him personally. And you know, I really regret that. But now he's got a chance to prove that he's something other than a spoiler. And that is to help other Democrats. And I don't know if he will or not, but I'm hoping he will.\" Out of the woods Immediately following her election loss, Clinton returned home to Chappaqua, N.Y., and spent a lot of time hiking in the woods nearby with her husband (the former president) and their dogs. \"It was part of a process after the election to come to terms with having lost, and my personal disappointment in letting millions of people down. Also my fears about what a Trump presidency might mean for our country and the world,\" Clinton said, back in the woods for her interview with Keith. \"So I had a lot to think about. And I think well when I'm walking. I sort of clear my mind.\" That first day in the woods, she ran into a woman walking with her baby and dog. Her Facebook post spawned a meme, \"HRC in the wild,\" and rapidly led to people looking for Clinton in the woods. \"One time we drove up here to go for a walk, and there were about a dozen people lying in wait, and I thought, 'OK we're gonna go somewhere more peaceful than that,' \" Clinton said. As the interview wrapped up, Clinton was approached by two women and a yellow Labrador.",

A lawsuit alleges Fox News and a wealthy Trump supporter intended to deflect public attention from growing concern about the administration's ties to the Russian government by concocting a story about Seth Rich's death.\n                \n                    \n                    Michael Robinson Chavez/The Washington Post/Getty Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption Mary Rich, the mother of slain Democratic National Committee staffer Seth Rich, speaks at a press conference on Aug. 1, 2016. A lawsuit alleges Fox News and a wealthy Trump supporter intended to deflect public attention from growing concern about the administration's ties to the Russian government by concocting a story about Seth Rich's death. The Fox News Channel and a wealthy supporter of President Trump worked in concert under the watchful eye of the White House to concoct a story about the death of a young Democratic National Committee aide, according to a lawsuit filed Tuesday. The explosive claim is part of a lawsuit filed against Fox News by Rod Wheeler, a longtime paid commentator for the news network. The suit was obtained exclusively by NPR. Wheeler alleges Fox News and the Trump supporter intended to deflect public attention from growing concern about the administration's ties to the Russian government. His suit charges that a Fox News reporter created quotations out of thin air and attributed them to him to propel her story. Fox's president of news, Jay Wallace, told NPR on Monday that there was no \"concrete evidence\" that Wheeler was misquoted by the reporter, Malia Zimmerman. The news executive did not address a question about the story's allegedly partisan origins. Fox News declined to allow Zimmerman to comment for this story. The story, which first aired in May, was retracted by Fox News a week later. Fox News has, to date, taken no action in response to what it said was a failure to adhere to the network's standards. The lawsuit focuses particular attention on the role of the Trump supporter, Ed Butowsky, in weaving the story. He is a wealthy Dallas investor and unpaid Fox commentator on financial matters who has emerged as a reliable Republican surrogate in recent years. Butowsky offered to pay for Wheeler to investigate the death of the DNC aide, Seth Rich, on behalf of his grieving parents in Omaha, Neb. On April 20, a month before the story ran, Butowsky and Wheeler \u2014 the investor and the investigator \u2014 met at the White House with then-press secretary Sean Spicer to brief him on what they were uncovering. The first page of the lawsuit quotes a voicemail and text from Butowsky boasting that Trump himself had reviewed drafts of the Fox News story just before it went to air and was published. Spicer now tells NPR that he took the meeting as a favor to Butowsky. Spicer says he was unaware of any contact involving the president. And Butowsky tells NPR that he was kidding about Trump's involvement. \"Rod Wheeler unfortunately was used as a pawn by Ed Butowsky, Fox News and the Trump administration to try and steer away the attention that was being given about the Russian hacking of the DNC emails,\" says Douglas Wigdor, Wheeler's lawyer. The back story On May 16, the Fox News Channel broke what it called a \"bombshell\" story about an unsolved homicide: the July 2016 shooting of 27-year-old Democratic Party staffer Seth Rich. Unfounded conspiracy theories involving Rich abounded in the months after his death, in part because WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange cryptically suggested that Rich's death may have been related to the leaks of tens of thousands of emails from Democratic Party officials and their allies at the peak of the presidential campaign. Fox News' story, which took flight online and ran in segments across major shows, breathed fresh life into the rumors. Fox reported that the leaks came from inside the party and not from hackers linked to Russia \u2014 despite the conclusions of the nation's most senior intelligence officials. The network suggested that Democrats might have been connected to Rich's death and that a cover-up had thwarted the official investigation. The network cited an unnamed FBI official. And the report relied heavily on Wheeler, a former police detective, hired months earlier on behalf of the Riches by Butowsky. These developments took place during growing public concern over a federal investigation into the Trump camp's possible collusion with the Russian government during the campaign. The allegations have since touched the president's son and son-in-law, his former campaign manager, his attorney general and his first national security adviser, who resigned as a result. The question of Rich's death took on greater urgency for Butowsky after Trump fired FBI Director James Comey in early May. Comey had been overseeing the Russia investigation. The story ran just a week later. Fox News host Sean Hannity speaks during the Conservative Political Action Conference in 2016. Rod Wheeler, a longtime paid commentator for Fox News, appeared on Hannity's show to discuss Seth Rich's death. A week after the appearance, Fox retracted the story, saying the reporting process failed to live up to its standards.\n                \n                    \n                    Saul Loeb/AFP/Getty Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption Fox News host Sean Hannity speaks during the Conservative Political Action Conference in 2016. Rod Wheeler, a longtime paid commentator for Fox News, appeared on Hannity's show to discuss Seth Rich's death. A week after the appearance, Fox retracted the story, saying the reporting process failed to live up to its standards. Fox's report went sideways shortly after it was posted online and aired on Fox & Friends. It was denounced by the Rich family, D.C. police, Democratic Party officials and even, privately, by some journalists within the network. Within hours, Wheeler told other news outlets that Fox News had put words in his mouth. Despite those concerns, Wheeler appeared on the shows of Fox Business host Lou Dobbs and Fox News star Sean Hannity, who devoted significant time to the story that night and in subsequent days. In speaking with Wheeler, Hannity said: \"If this is true and Seth Rich gave WikiLeaks the DNC e-mails ... this blows the whole Russia collusion narrative completely out of the water.\" A week later, on May 23, Fox retracted the story, saying the reporting process failed to live up to its standards. Hannity said he would take a break from talking about Rich's death out of respect for the family. And there it has largely stood \u2014 until now. The fake news story In the lawsuit, the private investigator sets out a different version of events. Wheeler, a paid Fox News contributor since 2005, alleges the story was orchestrated behind the scenes and from the outset by Butowsky, who hired him on behalf of the Rich family. The following account reflects the verbatim quotes provided from the texts, emails, voicemails and recorded conversations cited in Wheeler's lawsuit, except as otherwise noted. According to the lawsuit, Trump press secretary Sean Spicer meets at the White House with Wheeler and Butowsky to review the Rich story a month before Fox News ran the piece. On May 14, about 36 hours before Fox News' story appears, Butowsky leaves a voicemail for Wheeler, saying, \"We have the full, uh, attention of the White House on this. And tomorrow, let's close this deal, whatever we've got to do.\" Butowsky also texts Wheeler: \"Not to add any more pressure but the president just read the article. He wants the article out immediately. It's now all up to you.\" Spicer confirms meeting with the two but denies claims about the president. \"Ed's been a longtime supporter of the president and asked to meet to catch up,\" Spicer tells NPR on Monday night. \"I didn't know who Rod Wheeler was. Once we got into my office, [Butowsky] said, 'I'm sure you recognize Rod Wheeler from Fox News.' \" Spicer says Butowsky laid out what had been found about the case. \"It had nothing to do with advancing the president's domestic agenda \u2014 and there was no agenda,\" Spicer says. \"They were just informing me of the [Fox] story.\" Spicer says he is not aware of any contact, direct or not, between Butowsky and Trump. And Butowsky now tells NPR he has never shared drafts of the story with Trump or his aides \u2014 that he was joking with a friend. Instead, Butowsky repeatedly claims that the meeting was set up to address Wheeler's pleas for help landing a job for the Trump administration. Wheeler's attorney, Wigdor, says there is no evidence to support that claim. In the suit, Wheeler alleges that Butowsky was using the White House references to pressure him. Wheeler did play his own role in furthering the story. But he contends that he regretted it the same day it aired. His suit alleges Fox News defamed him by manufacturing two false quotations attributed to him and ruining his reputation by blaming him as the deceptive story fell apart. Wheeler, an African-American, is also suing the network for racial discrimination, saying he failed to advance as prominently as white counterparts. Fox News had no comment on that allegation. Who is Ed Butowsky? Butowsky is a silver-haired brash investor who became known for helping newly rich athletes figure out how to manage their money \u2014 and avoid getting fleeced. A native New Yorker and son of a former top enforcement officer for the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, Butowsky attended the University of Texas in the early 1980s. He set up his own company, Chapwood Capital Investment Management in Addison, Texas, outside Dallas, after a long stint at Morgan Stanley. Federal records compiled by the election finance database OpenSecrets.org show Butowsky has given money to the campaigns of nine politicians: seven Republicans and two Democrats, including $1,000 to Barack Obama's campaign in January 2008. The lawsuit alleges that Ed Butowsky, a wealthy Trump supporter from Texas, played a significant role in weaving a false story about Rich's death.\n                \n                    \n                    LM Otero/AP\n                    \n                \nhide caption The lawsuit alleges that Ed Butowsky, a wealthy Trump supporter from Texas, played a significant role in weaving a false story about Rich's death. In recent years, Butowsky has become outspoken about his political beliefs, becoming a familiar face on Fox News and its sister channel, the Fox Business Network. Butowsky has also appeared on Breitbart News' radio programs featuring then-Breitbart Chairman Steve Bannon, who became Trump's campaign chief and is now the president's senior political strategist. Butowsky emerged as a vocal backer of Trump's candidacy. He attended Trump's inauguration, posting pictures from the day on social media. In the Seth Rich case, Butowsky presented himself as a good Samaritan who came across a sliver of information about Seth Rich's death and shared it with the Riches. \"I thought, 'You know what? I'm going to help these people out,' \" Butowsky said on the radio show of David Webb, a conservative Fox News contributor. \"Somehow, these people need to know what happened to their little boy.\" He gave a similar account in an interview Monday with NPR. Wheeler's lawsuit alleges that Butowsky's generosity is clearly politically motivated. On Feb. 23, more than six months after Rich's death, Butowsky introduces himself to Wheeler with a flattering text, citing mutual friends from Fox News. \"Behind the scenes, I do a lot of work, (unpaid) helping to uncover certain stories,\" Butowsky writes, as recounted in the suit. \"[M]y biggest work was revealing most of what we know today about Benghazi,\" the deadly attack in Libya that sparked a congressional investigation of former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton. Later that day, Butowsky speaks to Wheeler for about 20 minutes by phone, saying his primary aim is to help the Rich family. The man behind the lawsuit: Rod Wheeler Wheeler, a 57-year-old former Washington, D.C., homicide detective, was part of the Metropolitan Police Department from 1990 to 1995, when he was dismissed, according to the agency. His New York City-based attorney, Wigdor, says Wheeler was fired for insubordination after his urine tested positive for trace amounts of marijuana. At the time he meets with Butowsky, Wheeler has been a paid contributor to Fox News for more than 11 years and has been actively but unsuccessfully seeking greater exposure on the network, according to the suit. Five days later, the two men meet in person at a lunch in Washington. Butowsky introduces an unexpected third guest: Malia Zimmerman, a Fox News investigative reporter based in Los Angeles known for enterprise reporting from a conservative standpoint. According to the account in the suit, Butowsky cautions Wheeler before they set out to meet the Riches: \"[M]ake sure to play down Fox News. Don't mention you know Malia.\" And Butowsky lays out a different mission than aiding the Rich family. Butowsky says he became convinced that the FBI had a report concluding that Seth Rich's laptop showed he had had contacts with WikiLeaks after speaking to the legendary reporter Seymour Hersh, who was also investigating Rich's death. According to the transcripts in the lawsuit, Butowsky says Hersh had an FBI source who confirmed the report. In an interview this week, Hersh sounds unconvinced. \"I hear gossip,\" Hersh tells NPR on Monday. \"[Butowsky] took two and two and made 45 out of it.\" Rich's parents initially welcome Wheeler's help and Butowsky's largesse. On March 14, Butowsky pays Wheeler $5,000, through a limited partnership company called Googie LP. (NPR found that Butowsky is listed in Texas public records as its general partner.) Wheeler does not make great headway. The FBI informs Butowsky, Wheeler and Zimmerman that the agency is not assisting the Washington, D.C., police on the investigation \u2014 undercutting claims about an FBI report. A Metro D.C. police detective tells Wheeler that Rich's death was likely a robbery gone awry and that the FBI is not involved. Preparing to publish On May 9, Trump fires Comey. On May 10, Butowsky and Zimmerman call Wheeler to say they have an FBI source confirming emails were sent from Seth Rich to WikiLeaks, though they do not share the source's identity, according to the investigator's suit. Wheeler will later say this is the only federal law enforcement source that Fox News \u2014 or he \u2014 has related to this story. Wheeler says he doesn't know whether that source emerged from Butowsky's conversation with Seymour Hersh or whether it was a fabrication. The next day, Zimmerman sends Wheeler a draft of her story, which is to run initially on the network's website. It includes no quotes from Wheeler. The night before the story ran and the day of the story itself, Butowsky coached Wheeler on what to say on the air.\" On the evening of May 14, Butowsky leaves a voicemail for Wheeler raising the stakes by invoking the White House and saying, \"Let's close this deal.\" A bit later that night, at 9:10 p.m., Butowsky texts Wheeler, according to Wheeler's suit: \"Not to add any more pressure but the president just read the article. He wants the article out immediately. It's now all up to you. But don't feel the pressure.\" As the night before the story is aired progresses, Butowsky is awake, online and anticipating what is to unfold in a few short hours. Butowsky sends an email to Fox News producers and hosts coaching them on how to frame the Rich story, according to the lawsuit. Recipients included Fox & Friends hosts, Steve Doocy, Ainsley Earhardt and Brian Kilmeade. \"I'm actually the one who's been putting this together but as you know, I keep my name out of things because I have no credibility,\" Butowsky writes, as reflected in the Wheeler suit. \"One of the big conclusions we need to draw from this is that the Russians did not hack our computer systems and ste[a]l emails and there was no collusion\" between \"Trump and the Russians.\" The night before the story ran and the day of the story itself, Butowsky coaches Wheeler on what to say on the air: \"[T]he narrative in the interviews you might use is that you and [Fox News reporter Malia Zimmerman's] work prove that the Russians didn't hack into the DNC and steal the emails and impact our elections.\" In another text, he writes: \"If you can, try to highlight this puts the Russian hacking story to rest.\" Fox goes with the story The story breaks earlier than expected. On the evening of May 15, Fox News' sister local station in Washington, Fox 5 DC, runs a story online at once promoting and pre-empting the network's apparent scoop. \"The police department nor the FBI have been forthcoming,\" Wheeler tells the station. \"They haven't been cooperating at all. I believe that the answer to solving his death lies on that computer, which I believe is either at the police department or either at the FBI. I have been told both.\" On Fox & Friends, the hosts call the story a 'bombshell.' \" Asked whether his sources have told him about information linking Rich to the WikiLeaks email dump, Wheeler says, \"Absolutely. Yeah. That's confirmed.\" The next morning, the story goes national. Fox News reports that evidence from Rich's laptop showed he had been in contact with WikiLeaks just days before the site posted those emails. Fox also reports that powerful forces were trying to quash the official investigation into his death. On Fox & Friends, the hosts call the story a \"bombshell.\" Zimmerman's online story cites an unnamed \"federal investigator who reviewed an FBI report\" for its findings. It also cites Wheeler, incorporating two key quotations from Wheeler that do not appear on video. In each, the private investigator seemingly takes ownership of the accusations. The first: \"My investigation up to this point shows there was some degree of email exchange between Seth Rich and WikiLeaks.\" The second: \"My investigation shows someone within the D.C. government, Democratic National Committee or Clinton team is blocking the murder investigation from going forward. That is unfortunate. Seth Rich's murder is unsolved as a result of that.\" The Riches torch Wheeler, saying they have seen no proof for his contentions. Wheeler alleges both quotations were fabricated and untrue. According to the lawsuit, Zimmerman promises to have those lines removed \u2014 but they stay in the story. Zimmerman then tells him that her bosses at Fox News had instructed her to leave those quotes in. That same day, the suit recounts, Zimmerman writes a letter to Seth Rich's father, Joel, distancing Fox News from responsibility for what the network reported: \"Much of our information came from a private investigator, Rod Wheeler, who we understand was working on behalf of you.\" Wheeler challenges Zimmerman over the letter in a three-way phone conversation that also included Butowsky. The Fox News reporter defends herself: \"That's the email that Fox asked me to send him. They wrote it for me.\" Wheeler replies: \"That's not accurate, though, because much, much of the information did not come from me.\" \"Not about the emails. Not the part about, I mean, the connection to WikiLeaks,\" Zimmerman acknowledges. \"But the rest of the quotes in the story did.\" Butowsky weighs in: \"One day you're going to win an award for having said those things you didn't say.\" Later, according to the recordings transcribed in the suit, Butowsky acknowledges Wheeler hadn't made any claims of personal knowledge about emails between Rich and WikiLeaks. \"I know that's not true,\" Butowsky says. \"If I'm under oath, I would say I never heard him say that.\" Both try to keep Wheeler on board, however. Zimmerman issues instructions for Wheeler's appearance on Sean Hannity's show later that evening. \"Reread the story we sent you last night [that contained the invented quotes] and stick to the script,\" she texts Wheeler. Despite his misgivings, Wheeler plays along. On Hannity's show, Wheeler says he doesn't personally know about Rich's emails or computers but says that a \"very credible\" federal investigator says \"he laid eyes on the case file.\" Wheeler offers energetic speculation though not much more: \"When you look at that with the totality of everything else that I found in this case it's very consistent for a person with my experience to begin to think well perhaps there were some e-mail communications between Seth and WikiLeaks.\" The aftermath On May 23, Fox News posts an unsigned statement retracting Zimmerman's online story. The network does not apologize or explain what went wrong. \"The article was not initially subjected to the high degree of editorial scrutiny we require for all our reporting,\" the statement reads. \"Upon appropriate review, the article was found not to meet those standards and has since been removed.\" In early June, Wheeler meets with Dianne Brandi, general counsel for the network, and Jay Wallace, the network's president for news. He makes his case that fabricated quotes had knowingly been attributed to him. Neither ever publicly speak of the matter afterward, until now. \"Since meeting with Rod Wheeler, we have also met with Malia Zimmerman to try to determine whether Rod was misquoted,\" Wallace says in a statement to NPR. \"As of now, we don't have concrete evidence that he was.\" A Fox News executive knowledgeable about the controversy, who would only speak if granted anonymity, tells NPR, \"The story was published to the website without review by or permission from senior management.\" The executive notes that Wallace had placed the broadcast and digital newsgathering teams under the same leadership for the first time after a series of management changes following the forced departure of the network's founder, the late Roger Ailes, and many of his top deputies. In late June, Wheeler warns Fox News and Butowsky that he may file suit. Three days later, Butowsky tweets: \"Fox News story was pulled b/c Rod Wheeler said [he] didn't say a quote ... How much did DNC pay him?\" And then Butowsky tweets: \"This shows Rod Wheeler has a major battle with the truth.\" The two men, thrust together on a common effort for months, have been torn apart by its aftermath. In the interview with NPR, Butowsky insists that he was acting out of a civic-minded spirit for the Riches and not with any partisan or political drive. Zimmerman remains on staff at Fox News, actively reporting on unrelated stories. A spokeswoman for the FBI tells NPR this week that the agency has played no part in the investigation of the unsolved homicide. And a spokeswoman for Washington's Metropolitan Police Department says, \"MPD stands behind its original assertion that Seth Rich was the victim of a botched armed robbery.\"",

            "article_content": "A three-judge panel begins a weeklong trial Monday over whether Texas's political maps  discriminate against minorities. If so, the state could be forced to redistrict before the 2018 election.  MARY LOUISE KELLY, HOST: To Texas now and an important political gerrymandering case that begins today in federal court in San Antonio. The case involves the maps that determine how Texans are grouped into districts when they vote for both state and federal elections. The question is whether the current maps discriminate against the state's fast-growing Hispanic population. NPR's Wade Goodwyn is here to explain the case to us. Good morning, Wade. WADE GOODWYN, BYLINE: Good morning. KELLY: Give us the back story here. This all started back in 2011, I gather. GOODWYN: Yeah, it's been a long case. KELLY: Long haul. GOODWYN: This case is about charges of racial gerrymandering, pure and simple. The Hispanic population has been exploding all across the state. But after these maps were drawn by Republicans, their opportunity to elect representatives actually was diminished. It was quite a sophisticated and, at times, cynical map-drawing operation. Emails in the court case revealed Republican operatives were trying to achieve districts that had what they called optimal Hispanic Republican voting strength. That was the phrase. And what it meant was GOP map drawers should try to create districts that looked Hispanic, but nevertheless, they would still be dominated by Republican candidates. And in another email, a San Antonio Republican House member wrote this. There's one area which includes two condo buildings with many GOP supporters and the San Antonio Country Club adjacent to my district; I would really like to get that. And here, we have a rather naked example of politicians choosing their voters, choosing their voters down to the level of condo buildings and country clubs. And this question in a democracy - who should get to make this choice, the voters or the politicians, that cuts to the heart of these gerrymandering cases all around the country. KELLY: You're talking about GOP map drawers here. Are we only talking about Republican gerrymandering? GOODWYN: No, it's mostly about Republican gerrymandering, but there's one part of the case that involved a white Democratic state House representative from Fort Worth, I think. And he was also afraid of the growing Hispanic population in his district, afraid an Hispanic Democrat would run against him and beat him in the primary. So he asked the Legislature that his district be redrawn, make it less Hispanic, and they did - the power of the incumbency in all it's not-so-glorious display. KELLY: (Laughter). GOODWYN: But it was in vain. The white Democrat did eventually get beat by a Hispanic Democrat in the 2014 primary. So I think the moral of the story is sometimes, demography is destiny, gerrymander though you might. KELLY: Well, let me ask you about one of the intriguing aspects here. This case is being heard by three judges, a federal panel, all this week. They are looking at the maps that these same three judges drew back in 2013 in an attempt to make things fair. So is what's happening this week judges are going to be judging their own maps? GOODWYN: It is bizarre. The question is that these judges, these - drew the maps. They tried to fix the discrimination problem that they felt the case might reveal based on the evidence they had before them. So the question now is, did these maps really fix the discrimination problem the Republicans created with their original maps back in 2011? And from their recently published findings of fact, it appears the federal panel is inclined to think more map fixing may need to be done. KELLY: Wade, real quick - how might this case change the balance of partisan power in Texas? GOODWYN: It would affect it, but it wouldn't change it. Texas is a Republican juggernaut. Even if the maps are drawn more fairly, Texas is solid Republican for now and for the foreseeable future. KELLY: All right, Wade, thanks very much. GOODWYN: It's my pleasure. KELLY: That's NPR's Wade Goodwyn reporting. (SOUNDBITE OF VIVID LOW SKY'S \"TAKE 6\") Copyright \u00a9 2017 NPR.  All rights reserved.

            "article_content": "Kara Swisher of Recode discusses the resignation of Uber's controversial CEO Travis Kalanick. Also, Republican Karen Handel won a special election in Georgia, dashing Democrats' hopes for an upset.  DAVID GREENE, HOST: It has been a very rough year for Uber. STEVE INSKEEP, HOST: To say the least - and here's how we got to this point. In February, a former Uber engineer blogged about how the company mishandled her sexual harassment complaints. That prompted other people to come forward. And that led to investigations, which found widespread sexual harassment and discrimination throughout the company. Last week, the CEO, Travis Kalanick, announced he was going on a leave of absence for personal reasons. And then late last night, the company announced he is stepping down. GREENE: OK, and let's talk about that with Kara Swisher. She is executive editor of \"Recode,\" which covers tech companies here in California. Hey, Kara. KARA SWISHER: Hey, how you doing? GREENE: I'm good, thank you. So I was reading your story about the Uber workplace culture. And you described it as something resembling real - a really toxic goat rodeo. SWISHER: Yeah, something like that. GREENE: I have never been to a goat rodeo. What exactly do you mean? SWISHER: It stinks. I can tell you it stinks, and it's quite messy. And that was what was going on at Uber - not just around sexual harassment, but - and sexism - but, you know, retaliatory behavior, lack of HR, lack of any kind of accountability of executives. And there's so many things that we uncovered and others, such as Mike Isaac at The New York Times, uncovered about various practices that were going on at the company under the leadership of Travis Kalanick. GREENE: Well, so Kalanick leaves now. Is this departure damaging for the company? Or is this actually helpful as they move forward now? SWISHER: Well, a lot of people have different opinions. At \"Recode,\" we wrote yesterday - in fact, yesterday morning I wrote that I thought he should step down. I was having sort of a debate with Arianna Huffington, who is on the board of Uber, who felt that he could be redeemed and that was to the good of Uber because he was innovative and had pushed the company forward. I felt it was like using poison to fix a patient who was poisoned. And to me, he was - you know, he was the reason Uber was the way it is. And it's also the reason why Uber was as successful as it is. But I think the issue is that had he - had the situation gotten just so bad and so toxic that he wasn't the one to solve the next problems that Uber faces, of which there are many. GREENE: Well, so you cover companies like Uber. You cover the problems that can exist. Are these problems unique to Uber in the workplace, or are we looking at something that is more widespread? SWISHER: Well, I wish I could say they were not uncommon - I mean, that they - that this was unusual. Maybe - I think Uber's the quintessence of this, sort of the concentration of it, of arrogance, of bro culture, of lack of gender equality, lack of racial equality at all these companies. But I think, you know, it's an unusual case, but every one of these things exists at every one, every big tech company in Silicon Valley. And I just think most companies have systems in place to deal with them, with these issues - you know, a sexual harassment issue. And Susan - let me just say, Susan deserves huge kudos for bringing this to light. GREENE: Susan... SWISHER: Susan Fowler, who was the engineer at Uber who wrote the first blog chat - post... GREENE: Right. SWISHER: ...Which was - which was called, \"My Very Strange Year At Uber\" (ph). And she deserves a lot of credit. But it's not unusual, unfortunately. GREENE: You really point to her blog post as as uncovering and sort of starting this process. SWISHER: Absolutely, 100 percent. She deserves - it was a very brave thing to do. And it turned out - it's caused a lot of repercussions for sure. INSKEEP: And this is a reminder, this is a company that overtly tried to disrupt the rules for taxi services around the country. But clearly, it's not going to be disrupting the rules for workplace harassment. SWISHER: In fact, no. GREENE: Yeah. All right, Kara Swisher is the executive editor of \"Recode,\" talking to us about Uber's CEO leaving the company. Kara, thanks a lot. SWISHER: Thanks a lot. GREENE: All right, a special election in Georgia last night decided only one of 435 seats in the House of Representatives. But judging by the tens of millions of dollars spent, it meant a lot to both parties. INSKEEP: Yeah, and Republican Karen Handel is the winner, beating Jon Ossoff, the Democrat, last night and winning a seat from northern Georgia. She addressed her supporters last night. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) KAREN HANDEL: To the Jon Ossoff supporters, know that my commitments, they extend to every one of you as well. We may have some different beliefs, but we are part of one community, the community of the 6th District. (CHEERING) INSKEEP: Which was a very particular community of interest to the political world. This was a special election widely seen as a referendum on President Trump. And the Republican candidate, of course, won. Although, we should note, it was a narrow win in a conservative district that Republicans would normally win very easily. GREENE: And our colleague, NPR's Don Gonyea, is in Georgia. He was covering this race. And, Don, it must have felt like you were covering a presidential campaign. There was so much interest here. DON GONYEA, BYLINE: It sure did. I mean, there were thousands of people at the Ossoff watch party last night. Handel had a huge crowd as well. It felt like - it felt presidential in terms of its size and the money spent - the money especially. GREENE: Well, what helped the Republican, Karen Handel, win? And what hurt the Democrat, Jon Ossoff? GONYEA: Well, she did it with turnout. She mobilized her base, built margins where she needed to build margins around the district. And remember, this was a runoff after April's election. Back then, Ossoff just missed the 50 percent threshold that would have put him in Congress right then and there. GREENE: Amazing. GONYEA: Handle only got 20 percent in that election. But the GOP took that as a wakeup call, it seems. They got out the vote, and they took advantages of the advantages you get in a really red district. Even though they were outspent, Ossoff last night told his supporters to take some consolation. He said they fought a fight in a place that nobody thought that they could fight. But again, ultimately, it's a missed opportunity. GREENE: Well, so, I mean, was this just a case where you have a lot of people who are addicted to politics and want to spend money, and this was the only race out there that they could pay attention to? Or are there some real conclusions that can be drawn in terms of a referendum on President Trump and his party? GONYEA: Somebody said to me, if you're a football fan in the summertime, you watch arena football because that's the only game there is. So that's... GREENE: (Laughter). Right, you don't want to. But if it's the only thing there is... INSKEEP: (Laughter). GREENE: That's great. GONYEA: This is the only place to spend the money. So the money all found its way here. GREENE: Yeah. GONYEA: But let's talk about President Trump. He jumped in here, and he got rewarded. And there wasn't a backlash against his presidency, as some had predicted and as Democrats needed. So even though he's not popular here - remember he only barely carried this district back in November - he got involved. He tweeted. He fundraised. He tweeted some more, and it was ultimately a good thing for Karen Handel, even though she would embrace him one day and seemed to keep him at arm's length the next. GREENE: That's interesting. INSKEEP: You know, Democrats who lost can say, well, it was a red district. It was an uphill climb. We got close. But in the end, they did lose. And this is what Democrats will need to do if they want to win the House in 2018, is win some red districts they haven't yet. GONYEA: That's right. This is exactly the kind of district they need if they hope to take over a majority of the U.S. House next year. Lots of suburban, highly educated, you know, voters, lots of moderate Republicans. And they weren't able to do it here. GREENE: NPR's Don Gonyea in the state of Georgia. Thanks, Don. GONYEA: My pleasure. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) GREENE: All right, we're looking at two congressional hearings today on Russia. And it sounds like lawmakers are turning back to their original focus, Russia. INSKEEP: Russia, rather than the subsidiary issues. There's been so much focus on what President Trump and his aides did or did not do. But these hearings today focus on underlying questions. How exactly did Russia interfere in the 2016 election? And what can be done to prevent it happening again? Former Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson will testify before the House intelligence committee today. He already met with the Senate intelligence committee last week behind closed doors. GREENE: NPR national security correspondent Mary Louise Kelly is going to - what, Mary Louise? - have like two TVs on at the same time watching these two hearings, or... MARY LOUISE KELLY, BYLINE: (Laughter) Dueling hearings on Capitol Hill. GREENE: Yeah, exactly. KELLY: It's going to be a good day. GREENE: Well, so what - is there, like, a central question about what Russia did or didn't do that lawmakers are trying to answer today? KELLY: Well, the banner development today is, as you all just noted, is that these Russia hearings are actually going to be about Russia for a change and not about politics here in Washington. So on the Senate side, for example, no marquee name is testifying today. Instead it's this roster of FBI, Homeland Security officials, state officials, all answering questions about Russia's ambitions - past, present and future. And I'm particularly interested to hear today about the present and future side of this, what we know about what Russia may be doing now, at this moment. There's a lot of focus on what's happening in Europe and interference in European elections - but this sense that Russia is not going away on the U.S. political landscape. GREENE: Well, former FBI Director James Comey testified. And he sort of seemed to suggest that this kind of Russian meddling is not just still going on but that it's probably not going to stop. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) JAMES COMEY: They'll be back. And they'll be back in 2020. They may be back in 2018. And one of the lessons they may draw from this is that they were successful because they introduced chaos and division and discord and so doubt about the nature of this amazing country of ours and our democratic process. It's possible they're misreading that as, it worked, and so we'll come back and hit them again in 2020. GREENE: Mary Louise, this is kind of extraordinary. I mean, is that just the future that we are accepting, that adversaries are going to meddle in one another's elections? KELLY: It likely is the future. It certainly is the past between the U.S. and Russia. I mean, one former U.S. official I was speaking to yesterday said the only problem with those statements like we just heard there from Comey is that it suggests Russia ever went away in the U.S. political landscape. So that's something to watch for today, this effort to deter foreign interference going forward. GREENE: All right. NPR's Mary Louise Kelly is going to be covering those two Russia hearings on Capitol Hill today. Mary Louise, thanks as always. KELLY: You're welcome. Copyright \u00a9 2017 NPR.

Visitors found a noose Wednesday at an exhibition on segregation at the National Museum of African American History and Culture in Washington, D.C. \u2014 the second time in less than a week that a noose was found on Smithsonian grounds. The incident \"is a painful reminder of the challenges that African-Americans continue to face,\" the museum's founding director, Lonnie Bunch, said in a statement. \"The noose has long represented a deplorable act of cowardice and depravity \u2014 a symbol of extreme violence for African-Americans.\" David Skorton, secretary of the Smithsonian Institution, condemned what he called an \"act of hatred and intolerance, especially repugnant in a museum that affirms and celebrates the American values of inclusion and diversity.\" In the institutionwide email reported by Smithsonian magazine, Skorton added, \"We will not be intimidated.\" After U.S. Park Police came to investigate the incident, they removed the noose and the exhibition reopened within a few hours, the magazine reports. The police did not respond to NPR's request for comment about the ongoing investigation. Five days earlier, police found a noose hanging from a tree near the Hirshhorn Museum, less than a mile away. The Southern Poverty Law Center tracks hate incidents and says they're on the rise. In mid-May, two 19-year-old men were arrested and charged in connection with a noose found hanging in front of a middle school in Crofton, Md., reports The Washington Post. And KPIX News says longshoremen walked off the job for a few hours on May 25 at the Port of Oakland in California, after nooses were found there a few weeks earlier. \"We've never had reports like this ever,\" says Southern Poverty Law Center Spokesman Ryan Lenz. He tells NPR that hate incidents \u2014 including bomb threats to religious institutions, racist graffiti and white nationalist flyers \u2014 have spiked in the aftermath of the 2016 presidential election. \"We never counted them before because they were so staggered,\" says Lenz. In the three months between Election Day and first week of February, the center has tracked more than 1,300 reports of bias incidents. \"We are in a moment where hate and extremism have been legitimized in the public sphere,\" says Lenz. \"During times like this, it is more important than ever for individual citizens across the country to voice their opposition to the acceptance of this behavior as standard operating procedure.\"",

President Trump just seems to have a thing for strongmen. He invited the brutal Philippine leader, Rodrigo Duterte, to the White House during a \"very friendly\" phone call Sunday. On Tuesday, Trump has another call \u2014 this one with Russian President Vladimir Putin. Trump's invitation came despite Duterte's violent crackdown on drugs, that has left more than 7,000 of his countrymen dead since he took power less than a year ago. The White House defended Trump's decision, saying the Philippines is a key partner in dealing with North Korea, but experts say that's a stretch. The United States and Western allies have long turned a blind eye to totalitarian regimes guilty of a long list of human-rights violations. Often, it was in the name of stability and at the expense of people suffering in those countries. But American leaders have mostly been mindful to choose their words carefully to maintain some semblance of a moral higher ground. What Trump is doing is different \u2014 past American leaders would almost never express admiration for bad actors. Trump, in many cases, has been doing exactly that. Duterte is hardly the only autocrat Trump has had kind words for. From Saddam Hussein's efficient killing of terrorists to the \"smart cookie\" in North Korea, Trump has praised strongmen around the world when others wouldn't. The following list reads like a who's who of totalitarian leaders with dicey human-rights records. And in all of the countries, the American president and real-estate magnate has a raft of potential conflicts of interest, too: Nickname: \"The Punisher\" a.k.a. \"Duterte Harry\" Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte speaks during the ASEAN Leaders' Summit in Manila, Philippines, last month.\n                \n                    \n                    Bullit Marquez/AP\n                    \n                \nhide caption Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte speaks during the ASEAN Leaders' Summit in Manila, Philippines, last month. What he's accused of: More than 7,000 Filipinos killed under his rule in his anti-drug crusade. In a warped comparison, he praised Hitler this way: \"Hitler massacred three million Jews. Now, there is three million drug addicts. I'd be happy to slaughter them.\" He added that he wants to \"finish the problem of my country and save the next generation.\" (Fact check: it was six million European Jews who were killed in the Holocaust.) ... He has undermined the judiciary ... Called experts \"stupid\" ... Threatened to \"whack\" mayors who stood in the way of his tactics ... Upset about traffic, he called the Pope a \"son of a whore\" ... \"Joked\" about a woman who was raped. ... Justified the killing of journalists. \"Just because you're a journalist,\" he said, \"you are not exempted from assassination, if you're a son of a bitch.\" The Philippines is one of the most dangerous countries in the world for journalists to work \u2014 78 journalists have been killed there since 1992, the third most of any country behind Iraq and Syria. (Somalia is behind the Philippines at No. 4.) Though Duterte's praised Trump, he's also said: \"He is a bigot and I am not.\" Quotable: \"Forget the laws on human rights. If I make it to the presidential palace, I will do just what I did as mayor. You drug pushers, hold-up men and do-nothings, you better go out. Because I'd kill you. I'll dump all of you into Manila Bay, and fatten all the fish there.\" What Trump has said about him (emphasis ours): The White House issued a readout of their phone call from April 29: \"It was a very friendly conversation, in which the two leaders discussed the concerns of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) regarding regional security, including the threat posed by North Korea. They also discussed the fact that the Philippine government is fighting very hard to rid its country of drugs, a scourge that affects many countries throughout the world. President Trump enjoyed the conversation and said that he is looking forward to visiting the Philippines in November to participate in the East Asia Summit and the U.S.-ASEAN Summit. President Trump also invited President Duterte to the White House to discuss the importance of the United States-Philippines alliance, which is now heading in a very positive direction.\" Duterte now might not even come. \"I am tied up,\" Duterte said Monday. \"I cannot make any definite promise. I am supposed to go to Russia, I am supposed to go to Israel.\" Potential Trump conflict: His name is on a 57-story, $150 million building in Manila.

            "article_content": "\"Millions of poor, disadvantaged students are trapped in failing schools.\" So said President Trump at the White House recently. It's a familiar lament across the political spectrum, so much so that you could almost give it its own acronym : PKTIFS (Poor Kids Trapped In Failing Schools). Where there's no consensus, however, is on the proper remedy for PKTIFS. The Obama administration's signature proposal was the School Improvement Grant. This was a $7 billion attempt to turn around struggling schools with some combination of replacing personnel, overhauling the curriculum, renewed teacher support and other practices. It was one of the largest federal education grant programs ever created. There was just one problem. As a department-commissioned independent review concluded just as Obama was leaving office, it didn't work. \"Overall, across all grades, we found ... no significant impacts on math or reading test scores, high school graduation, or college enrollment.\" President Trump, and his education secretary, Betsy DeVos, are largely focused on the T for \"trapped\" part of the problem. They talk about creating escape routes, largely by expanding charter and voucher programs. Richard Kahlenberg has spent decades stumping for a third way. His idea: Create public schools that are more integrated. He helped innovate the use of social and economic indicators to do that \u2014 instead of race and ethnicity, the use of which is prohibited by a 2007 Supreme Court decision. Richard Kahlenberg\n                \n                    \n                    Courtesy of Richard Kahlenberg\n                    \n                \nhide caption His strategy could be summed up as: Give poor kids the opportunity to attend school with not-so-poor kids. The organization where he's a senior fellow, the Century Foundation, keeps track of 100 districts and charter schools around the country that are currently trying various integration strategies. The foundation recently released a paper with nine case studies: New York; Chicago; Dallas; Hartford and Stamford, Conn.; Jefferson County, Ky.; Eden Prairie, Minn.; Champaign, Ill.; and Cambridge, Mass. [The integration strategy in Jefferson County is challenged by a new bill in the state legislature.] Though it may seem quixotic, Kahlenberg says there's reason to be optimistic about integration policies. After all, we've tried everything else. \"I was critical of [former Education Secretary Arne] Duncan when he proposed school turnaround and ignored segregation,\" Kahlenberg says. \"When they announced federal turnaround efforts, Duncan bragged about the fact that in Chicago, 'We had the same kids but we changed the adults.' \"On one level I understand that,\" he continues. \"Even in segregated environments, there are positive things you can do for kids. Yet, it seemed to be taking off the table this really powerful tool that 50 years of research suggest can make a big difference in students' lives.\" NPR Ed talked to Kahlenberg about this body of research. First, about the case for creating schools that are both economically and racially integrated, and second, on how to go about that. What's the educational case for integration? There are three reasons: the kids, the parents and the teachers. Kids who have big dreams and are expecting to go on to college are less likely to cause disruption, cut classes and are more likely to be academically engaged. On average, those peers are found more often in economically mixed than in high-poverty schools. It's also an advantage to be in a classroom where your peers are high-achieving. For example, children of professionals have bigger vocabularies on average than low-income students, and that will rub off. As for the parents, again, not attaching any blame, but middle-class parents are more likely to be PTA members and volunteer in class. That parental involvement benefits every child in a school. And finally, the teachers deemed more effective are more likely to be found in economically mixed schools. That has to do with those first two factors. It's easier to teach in a school with fewer discipline issues and with parents who are there to help out. OK, but what about the middle-class students? Is there evidence that it won't hurt them to attend a more diverse school? Yes, the research shows that middle-class students tend to do as well academically in economically mixed schools. But more than that, there's emerging research to suggest that, indeed, middle-class students benefit from both economic and racial diversity. As we become a majority-minority nation, more millennial parents are recognizing that it's a skill to thrive in diverse environments, and employers are looking for people who can get along with individuals from all different backgrounds. That said, most of the criteria we use to judge school performance, like test scores, are tightly correlated with class. How do you get parents who are privileged to choose an economically mixed school? I think it's an exciting moment for magnet schools. When magnet schools offer different themes and pedagogical approaches, they're providing things that are popular with enough parents that it opens the door to the reality of school integration in a way that's politically palatable. [DeVos spoke recently at the Magnet Schools of America conference, where she highlighted the role of magnet schools in reducing segregation. This recent review of research on magnet schools shows both positive and null results on academic performance, although most studies support higher graduation rates at magnet schools. When NPR Ed went looking for a school that had succeeded under the School Improvement Grant program, we profiled a magnet school.] In New York City, where I live, as your report notes, 77 percent of students live in poverty. How do you create economically mixed schools if there aren't enough middle-class kids to go around? I worked with Chicago Public Schools on their socioeconomic integration plan. The district is 85 percent low-income. My recommendation was not to ensure that every school was 85 percent low-income, because high-poverty schools are bad for students. In Chicago what they've done is to begin with magnet and selective-enrollment schools. You want to create a virtuous cycle where people can see examples of success. [According to the recent report, Chicago's selective enrollment or \"exam high schools\" are much more racially balanced than their counterparts in Boston and New York City. And in those Chicago schools students from all backgrounds are keeping up academically and graduating at very high rates.] It almost sounds like a chemistry experiment \u2014 you have to control the conditions very carefully and titrate your mixture until it hits that tipping point. The long-term aspiration is that, as you develop more socioeconomically integrated schools, that the overall demographics of the public school system could shift. We saw that in Cambridge: Over time, more middle-class and white people came back into the district, stopped using private schools and stopped moving away once their kids got to be a certain age. How good are the chances of seeing more districts try integration in this policy climate? Most of the focus around choice has been on charter schools, and I think now, maybe after an election that revealed these tremendous divisions by race, class and gender, there's an opportunity to harness the interest in choice for a program that will actually bring kids of different backgrounds together, and heal some of those divisions that we saw come out during the election. Now, at a programmatic level, there's lots of reasons for someone like me to be depressed, because DeVos and Trump haven't talked [much] about the benefits of school integration. But you can see lots of progress on the issue of school integration that isn't directed by the feds. ... So, rather than continuing to pound our heads against the wall in finding new ways to make separate but equal work, we could rediscover this other approach that actually is having really strong results.",

            "article_content": "The U.S. Constitution prohibits \"an establishment of religion,\" but U.S. presidents have long paid tribute to the importance of faith in a divine power. \"Every free government is imbedded soundly in a deeply-felt religious faith, or it makes no sense,\" said Dwight D. Eisenhower, speaking at the first National Prayer Breakfast in 1953. Since then, all presidents have spoken at the annual event, often highlighting their own faith or the role of prayer in their personal lives. Sometimes it feels as though only divine intervention can bring Republicans and Democrats together in Washington. Sens. Chris Coons and John Boozman This year's breakfast will give President Trump another opportunity to burnish his less than perfect reputation as a religious man. The White House on Wednesday confirmed that he will speak at the event, which by tradition is co-chaired by a Republican and Democratic member of Congress. The breakfast is meant to provide a break from partisan acrimony. \"Sometimes it feels as though only divine intervention can bring Republicans and Democrats together in Washington,\" wrote Sens. Chris Coons, D-Del., and John Boozman, R-Ark., the hosts of this year's breakfast, in a jointly signed column in the Washington Examiner. It doesn't always work. Ben Carson used his speech at the 2013 Prayer Breakfast to make a blistering attack on President Obama, who was seated just a few feet away, and thereby launched his own political career. A principal speaker this year will be Rick Warren, pastor of the Saddleback Church network in California. Warren has attempted to be nonpartisan in his ministry and offered a prayer at Obama's inauguration in 2009. \"I think it is an important thing,\" Warren said in a Facebook video, referring to the breakfast, \"particularly right now, after this last election and campaigning, which has really divided America.\" He cited the Sermon on the Mount, in which Jesus called on his followers to be peacemakers. \"Who wants to bring peace? As Christians, we are called to do that,\" Warren said. With his own speech at the breakfast, Trump will have to choose whether to attempt some reconciliation with his political opponents or confront them, as he has done in the past week, as Democrats in Congress resisted his Cabinet nominations. Some advocates of LGBT rights have feared that Trump will use his speech at the prayer breakfast to announce a new executive order providing greater protection for Christian conservatives who oppose same-sex marriage and other accommodations for LGBT individuals. Those concerns were somewhat alleviated by a White House announcement on Tuesday that the Trump administration would continue to enforce a 2014 executive order signed by Obama that barred discrimination against LGBT people working for federal contractors. White House officials, however, have not ruled out the possibility of another executive order on the issue. Trump's order last week suspending the admission of refugees and temporarily barring immigration from seven majority-Muslim countries could also be an issue at the prayer breakfast. The order has aroused stiff and vocal opposition from many Christian groups. Hundreds of foreign dignitaries will be on hand at the breakfast, including King Abdullah II of Jordan, a country currently burdened by a huge influx of Syrian refugees. Abdullah met earlier in the week with Vice President Pence and Defense Secretary James Mattis, but his encounter with Trump at the breakfast will be their first meeting. Trump has made clear he would like more assistance from countries like Jordan in the fight against ISIS, but Jordanian authorities worry that Trump's promise to move the U.S. Embassy in Israel to Jerusalem could make it politically difficult to show more support for the United States.",

The White House announced the move in a relatively short statement early Tuesday, saying that the president \"is determined to protect the rights of all Americans, including the LGBTQ community.\" The announcement comes after reports that the White House was considering a new executive order that would undo former President Barack Obama's 2014 executive order that gave new protections to gay and transgender people.

In today's statement, the White House says, \"The President is proud to have been the first ever GOP nominee to mention the LGBTQ community in his nomination acceptance speech, pledging then to protect the community from violence and oppression.\" Trump's decision largely conforms with his election campaign, in which he didn't often seek to highlight either gay rights or restrictions. The new president's plan for his first 100 days didn't mention taking actions to strip LGBTQ rights or protections, but Trump did list as his first priority the canceling of \"every unconstitutional executive action, memorandum and order issued by President Obama.\" While the persistence of the executive order suggests Trump agrees with Obama's action, civil rights activists have worried that the president might appoint a U.S. Supreme Court justice who has ruled against gay rights. At 8 p.m. ET Tuesday, Trump is scheduled to name his pick to replace the late Justice Antonin Scalia. After Trump's election, activists on both sides of the issue wondered how his administration might treat legal claims of \"religious liberty,\" a phrase that has been invoked by those who oppose LGBTQ discrimination protections and, in many cases, gay marriage \u2014 and who say that adjusting to new federal laws requires them to compromise their beliefs.",

A lot happened on the race beat the past few days; so much so that it prompted Code Switch's Shereen Marisol Meraji to channel Kendrick Lamar in this week's podcast: Maybe we all need to dive into Lamar's giant pool of liquor. Pour. Drink. Pass out. Dominating the news were President Donald Trump's executive orders. One calls for the construction of a massive wall along the U.S.-Mexico border. Another promises to cut federal funding for so-called sanctuary cities if they refuse to cooperate with federal immigration officials. A third clears the way for construction of the Dakota Access Pipeline, which Native Americans have fought passionately to prevent. POTUS is also issued executive orders that halt the Syrian refugee program and suspend immigration from predominantly Muslim countries, including Iraq and Iran. Here are some non-executive-orders links that passed over our transom. Voter dilution or voter fraud? CityLab's Brentin Mock digs into voter dilution, which he argues is the real voter fraud. \"If Trump would like to see real evidence of fraudulent election activity, there are plenty of cities and counties for him to examine. He should Google \"voter dilution.\" It's what happens when a city or county creates council districts where it would be impossible for minority residents to elect a candidate of their choice. This typically is achieved by replacing a council district where people of color constitute a majority with an at-large council seat that is elected by voters across the entire city or county. As a majority within a district, voters of color can elect a candidate of their preference, but if they are a minority across a city or county, their candidates can not compete for an at-large seat. It happens often, and there is plenty of evidence of it.\" Just look to Pasadena, Texas, Mock writes. In 2013, Pasadena lawmakers redrew the city's district lines, making it very difficult for Latino residents to win any of the at-large seats. EPA: Flint discriminated against African-Americans The EPA's civil rights office found evidence of discrimination against African-Americans in a decades-old power plant permit hearing in Flint, Mich. The Center for Public Integrity's Talia Buford, who has reported extensively on the water crisis in Flint, her hometown, has more: \"In a letter dated Jan. 19, the last full day of the Obama administration, the EPA's External Civil Rights Compliance Office said the evidence showed that 'African Americans were treated less favorably than non-African Americans' during permit hearings for the Genesee Power Station \u2013 which burns wood waste and other debris \u2013 from 1992 through 1994. A 'preponderance of the evidence in EPA's record would lead a reasonable person to conclude that race discrimination was more likely than not the reason ...,' office director Lilian Dorka wrote to the complainant, Father Phil Schmitter of the St. Francis Prayer Center in Flint. \"In a statement, Schmitter said, \"Communities of color and schoolchildren have had to grow up near this horrible power plant and be subjected to its harmful emissions. It's unbelievable that it took EPA decades to make this finding, but it's important to send a clear message to [the company] that it needs to change the way it does business.\" Roxane Gay pulls her book from Simon & Schuster Gay, the author of Difficult Women and An Untamed State, pulled her forthcoming book, How To Be Heard, from the publishing house, citing its reported $250,000 deal with Breitbart editor Milo Yiannopoulous. Gay described Yiannopoulous' work as \"blunt, inelegant hate and provocation.\" BuzzFeed's deputy books editor Jarry Lee had the scoop, along with a statement from Gay: \"I just couldn't bring myself to turn the book in. My editor emailed me last week and I kept staring at that email in my inbox and finally over the weekend I asked my agent to pull the book. ... \"And to be clear, this isn't about censorship. Milo has every right to say what he wants to say, however distasteful I and many others find it to be. He doesn't have a right to have a book published by a major publisher but he has, in some bizarre twist of fate, been afforded that privilege. So be it. I'm not interested in doing business with a publisher willing to grant him that privilege.\" How a slavery-era outbreak was linked to cornbread Mark Essig, a writer and historian, wrote for Atlas Obscura that many white Southerners blamed the outbreak of a disease named pellagra on the abolition of slavery. After slavery ended, they started getting their corn from the Midwest, which they concluded was tainted as it was transported. Some Southerners also thought \"badly made cornbread\" \u2014 i.e., cornbread not made by enslaved people \u2014 was tainted by pellagra. Cornbread free of the disease needed to have fingerprints, Essig reported: \"Those fingerprints served as evidence of who was missing: The cooks of the Old South. The Macon Daily Telegraph explained that real cornbread required 'a hickory wood fire, an iron skillet and lid, and an old negro mammy. ... She will mix the meal and water, fashion it into pones in her hands, drop the pones into the hot skillet, [and] pat them with her hands.' The Civil War, by freeing enslaved cooks, had deprived white Southerners of proper bread. And it wasn't just the cook who was missing\u2014it was an entire social fabric, imagined through a fanciful vision of antebellum racial harmony known as the 'Lost Cause' \u2014 the belief that Southern ideals had been sanctified by the blood of the fallen, that slavery civilized the enslaved, that God had ordained white supremacy.\" Labeling the Muslim Brotherhood a terror group has \"hidden dangers\" Sen. Ted Cruz's legislation proposing that the Muslim Brotherhood be classified a terrorist group creates \"hidden dangers\" for journalists and academics alike, argues Andrew March, a Yale political science professor. In an op-ed piece for The Washington Post, said that those conducting research on the Brotherhood \"could find themselves at risk of prosecution for 'material support' of terrorism.\" More from March: \"Whatever else it may be, the Muslim Brotherhood is an organization that has been studied, contacted \u2014 and in some cases advised \u2014 by a large percentage of academic researchers, journalists and analysts working on the Middle East. This raises a multitude of questions: What would it mean legally if the Brotherhood were officially designated a Foreign Terrorist Organization (FTO)? Could its files be subpoenaed? Could the publishing of interviews with Brotherhood members be designated as material support? Could speech activities related to defending the ideology and worldview of the Brotherhood, perhaps by contrasting it with more radical forms of jihadist ideology, be subject to prosecution?\"",

President Trump has ordered the Department of the Interior to review all designations of national monuments greater than 100,000 acres created since 1996. That executive order, which he signed Wednesday, places at least 20 \u2014 and as many as 40 \u2014 monuments in the government's sights. The areas now under review span a vast range of landscapes \u2014 from arid deserts to frozen mountain peaks, from striking craggy vistas to teeming underwater playgrounds. And, though these monuments were all established roughly in the past two decades, they all have a history more than a century long. That's because all of them owe their existence to the 1906 Antiquities Act, a law signed by President Theodore Roosevelt that makes it a federal crime to destroy or alter ancient artifacts and ruins on federal land. The act also gives the president the authority to designate national monuments. More recently, with most large public lands protection bills stalled in Congress, presidents from Bill Clinton to George W. Bush and Barack Obama have used the act as a tool to protect sweeping amounts of federal land mostly in the West. President Obama's late hour designation of the Bears Ears National Monument in Utah, for instance, protects more than a million acres \u2014 even though the Antiquities Act specifies that monuments designated by a president \"in all cases shall be confined to the smallest area compatible.\" It's this perceived overreach that partly spurred Trump to sign his executive order. But if, after the review, Trump also decides to bypass Congress and act by executive order to shrink or even nullify any of the monuments, a court challenge is all but guaranteed. \"The Antiquities Act expressly authorizes the President to create a national monument, but it does not authorize a later President to revoke or modify a national monument,\" says Prof. Carl Tobias of the University of Richmond School of Law.

At 1.35 million acres, the national monument is also among the largest in the country. The only national monument to be named specifically in Trump's executive order, Bears Ears has been a point of significant controversy since it was created in December last year. Republicans point to its establishment as an example of severe executive overreach, saying its 1.35-million-acre expanse is gratuitous and unfairly encroaches on the rights of Utah residents, who cannot develop oil and gas drilling or expand cattle grazing on the land. But for the region's Native American tribes, who see the site as sacred, the national monument designation was a massive victory they are prepared to defend. \"I'm standing for what my people are wanting,\" Davis Filfred, Navajo Nation Council Delegate in Utah, tells NPR, \"and I'll continue to stand and fight for what's right.\" The Gold Butte National Monument in southeastern Nevada was established in the waning days of Obama's presidency last year. It covers roughly 300,000 acres of land.\n                \n\n                    Bureau of Land Management/Flickr\n                    \n\nhide caption The Gold Butte National Monument in southeastern Nevada was established in the waning days of Obama's presidency last year. It covers roughly 300,000 acres of land. Similar to Bears Ears, Nevada's recently established Gold Butte National Monument has also drawn controversy of its own. Standing at about 300,000 acres, the monument in southwest Nevada rests not far from where Cliven Bundy and fellow local ranchers engaged in an armed standoff with federal law enforcement in 2014. Together with Bears Ears, Gold Butte protects \"some of our country's most important cultural treasures, including abundant rock art, archeological sites, and lands considered sacred by Native American tribes,\" Obama said in a statement last December. But as resentment against perceived federal encroachment has risen in the area, so too had fears for the safety of law enforcement officers in the area.",

Well, we asked and then you asked. Over the past couple of weeks, dozens of you have responded to our call out \u2014 we've gotten letters from all over the country about the complex racial situations people find themselves in. Our goal? Offer up some advice on America's race problems \u2014 from the merely awkward to the downright inappropriate \u2014 with a thing we're calling 'Ask Code Switch.' We got questions about whiteness and wokeness. About fashion and fetishes. Oh, and family. So many questions about in-laws, Thanksgiving dinner and parents who just don't understand. So to kick things off, we talked with Weekend Edition's Lulu Garcia-Navarro about dealing with family members who don't see eye-to-eye when it comes to racial justice. That question was by far the most common topic in the letters we got, and seems particularly relevant in the wake of Charlottesville. Here's how Christina Cameron, of Durham, N.C., put it: I let it slip to my mother that I was going to a Black Lives Matter rally. She kind of knew I was involved in BLM as a white person, but she didn't really know the extent. During our call, she called me brainwashed and said that if I got hurt and ended up in the hospital, she wouldn't come see me. If I got arrested, she wouldn't come bail me out. The next week, it was a barrage of emails from my dad saying I can't stand up to the godlessness of my peers, and that I'm involved in a terrorist organization. I told them, \"No, these are the principles you raised me with as a Christian.\" They said, \"Don't tell anyone we had anything to do with the way that you are now.\" We don't really talk much since then. I know that as a white person in this movement, my responsibility is to talk to other white people about race and racism. I've done that pretty well. But I just can't seem to get through to my parents. We're kind of at an impasse and I don't know where to go. Shereen: I don't know if this is going to be popular advice, but I've been in therapy long enough to know that when you're opening up conversations like this, that you know are going to be tough, stay away from trigger words. In this case, words like racism, and bigot and bigotry. I feel like you have to have more of a soft opening with your family. And go into the discussion sideways. I just don't know if saying, \"Hey, Mom and Dad, you're being racist,\" ever helps the conversation. Also, know that you might never get through to your parents. And maybe you should try and have the conversation with family members who are more open to listening to you. Sometimes you don't want to hit your head against the wall over and over again. You just have to say, we agree to disagree. Gene: Yeah, I think this is even true of conversations with your family that don't involve race at all. You have to go in with realistic, honest understandings of what your expectations are. Are you trying to have a conversation with your mom and your dad in which you want to change their worldview? That's not realistic. If you want them to understand where you're coming from, that's a long process. You're not going to resolve that in one conversation. There are two pieces of reporting that seem relevant here. I was talking to Phillip Atiba Goff, [a professor at John Jay College of Criminal Justice] who works in institutional bias. And he said that the reason you confront your family members about their views, if you think they're bigoted views, is not because you want to change their minds, so much as to establish that they can't say those things without some kind of push-back. You're pushing back on things your uncle says so that your nieces and nephews understand that those views will be met with some push-back. So even if they don't change their minds, they have to consider whether those views are worth saying. The other thing that might be relevant is that, in the wake of the election, a lot of groups that focus on white people who work in social justice spaces have been really honest about how important it is to have other white people to talk to about this stuff. Because the problems of white people in these spaces are specific to white people, right? I don't have a white parent. I don't know what it's like to have to change a parent's bigoted views about black people. So people need a space that they can go to deal with that very real feeling of being cleaved from their family when they have a big fallout over these things. It can sometimes be cumbersome to bring those problems to a social justice space with a bunch of brown people who are dealing with their own issues. So sometimes it's helpful and useful to have a space with other white people you can commiserate with, and know that you're not alone. What do you think? What kinds of difficult or awkward racial questions come up in your family? How have you handled it?

Rural communities dependent on U.S. public lands for everything from outdoor recreation to hunting to livestock grazing could be hit hard under the Trump administration's latest budget proposal unveiled Tuesday. Still subject to approval by Congress, the president's budget includes a roughly $1.4 billion cut to the Department of Interior and far deeper cuts to the Department of Agriculture: combined the two agencies own and manage more than 700 million acres of public lands, mostly in the West. Here are three items of note in the Department of Interior budget alone that aren't generating much attention so far. But they could disproportionately hit rural communities, many of which tended to support President Trump in last year's election. As a congressman representing Montana, Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke was a vocal supporter of the Land and Conservation fund. But at a budget briefing for reporters Tuesday he appeared to sound a different tune on future land acquisition and conservation more generally. \"Rather than simply adding more land, we want to make sure we take care of what we have,\" Zinke said. Like many of his predecessors, Secretary Zinke has articulated a broad, if sometimes complicated, vision for the future of public lands management. On the one hand, he's pledged to be a conservation champion in the spirit of Teddy Roosevelt. But he's also promised to boost the economies of rural American towns by increasing mining and other development on public lands that surround them. For sure, this reflects the often competing \"multiple use\" mission of DOI agencies such as the Bureau of Land Management. But Zinke predicted that reversing Obama-era policies restricting off-shore drilling alone could bring revenue back for many of the restoration and conservation programs currently facing cuts. \"Some of it has been due to oil and gas pricing, but not all,\" Zinke said. \"A lot of it is uncertainty that we have not been a good partner with industry.\" Still, many influential sportsmen and public lands groups say the administration's budget is directly at odds with many of the conservation values Mr. Zinke espouses. \"When you talk about on the one hand, increasing access, and then you cut out the very tool to do that, it's hard to reconcile,\" said Land Tawney, executive director of Backcountry Hunters and Anglers. Tawney says the DOI's budget proposal is reflective of a broader trend that he says has been building in Washington in recent years: \"when you starve these agencies of their budgets, you make them look sick, so we can [then] think about divesting in them.\" As much of the rural West in particular has been transitioning from a resource-based economy to one more dependent on outdoor recreation, groups like Tawney's have flexed their political muscle recently. They say they plan to press Congress in the coming weeks as well, if the administration's budget proposal moves forward. Meantime there is early and widespread speculation that much of the budget stands little chance of passing Congress, at least in its current form, even with the president's party in control of both the House and the Senate. For his part Tuesday, Secretary Zinke seemed to view the latest budget proposal as a conversation starter, even if it's controversial. He argued that many federal land agencies need to be overhauled and updated with a longer term vision. \"I view this as a reorganization to look at how best to manage, protect and use our public lands in the next 100 years, given that we have a number of challenges,\" Zinke said.",

He worries the proposed transfer of federal lands to the states would jeopardize the public's access to these lands.\n                \n                    \n                    Kirk Siegler/NPR\n                    \n                \nhide caption Buzz Hettick scans federal Bureau of Land Management land near his home in Laramie, Wyo., scouting for an upcoming hunt. He worries the proposed transfer of federal lands to the states would jeopardize the public's access to these lands. Wyoming has become a flash point in the debate over whether hundreds of millions of acres of federal public lands should be turned over to state hands. From Buzz Hettick's place on the edge of the windswept college town of Laramie, it's a short drive into the heart of these remote lands, vast tracts run by the federal Bureau of Land Management. On a recent, blustery morning, Hettick was scouting out an elk hunt in the Laramie range, a patchwork of private and public BLM land north of his home. \"A lot of wildlife uses public lands,\" he says. So do big game hunters like Hettick. Hunting is big business in the rural West and Wyoming is no exception. A recent study estimated it brings in roughly $25 million into Albany County's economy alone. Hettick is eager to show off this land \u2014 and talk about protecting access to it \u2014 to anyone who will make the trip. \"I just don't see how people can look at this out here ... and all they see is a dollar sign attached to it; there's a lot more than that,\" Hettick says. When it comes to politics, those dollar signs and federal lands are inextricably linked in the West. There's always pressure to lease more land to private producers of oil, gas, coal and, lately, wind. But avid sportsmen like Hettick, who lobbies for the national group Backcountry Hunters and Anglers, now see a new threat. \"Anytime there's even a whisper of anybody that wants to transfer federal lands to the states, you're going to raise the ire and the hackles of the outdoor community ... in particular hunters and fisherman,\" Hettick says. This time it's more than just a whisper. At their party's 2016 convention in Cleveland last summer, Republicans included a provision in the RNC platform calling for the transfer of ownership of federal land to states. One of the biggest questions surrounding this is whether a rural state like Wyoming with a small budget can really afford to manage all this land. Groups like BHA worry the cash-strapped states would be forced to sell it, which could endanger access to hunters or anyone else who likes to enjoy U.S. public lands. It's not yet clear whether President-elect Donald Trump endorses the idea. But his son, Donald Trump Jr., is an avid hunter and member of Hettick's group. The younger Trump is said to have been influential in his father's pick of Montana Rep. Ryan Zinke, who opposes the transfer, to be interior secretary. Nevertheless, Hettick isn't hedging any bets. He says sportsmen are on offense. \"It's the biggest battle that sportsmen are going to have to face in my lifetime,\" he says. The Laramie range north of Laramie, Wyo., is a mix of private and public lands run by the U.S. Bureau of Land Management. About half of all the land in Wyoming is controlled by the federal government.\n                \n                    \n                    Kirk Siegler/NPR\n                    \n                \nhide caption The Laramie range north of Laramie, Wyo., is a mix of private and public lands run by the U.S. Bureau of Land Management. About half of all the land in Wyoming is controlled by the federal government. In Wyoming, that battle is starting in the legislature. Lawmakers are considering a proposed constitutional amendment that would lay the groundwork for Wyoming to own and manage federal public land by 2019, should the GOP-controlled Congress move ahead with the transfer. Hettick mobilized sportsmen from around the state to brave snowy roads and travel to the capital, Cheyenne, for a recent hearing. Clad in camouflage, they wore \"keep public lands public\" stickers and lined up to testify against the proposed amendment. Cheers and woops erupted when one hunter at the hearing advised the committee that they didn't support any of the bill's language, \"because we don't support the amendment.\" Neither does Wyoming's Republican Governor Matt Mead. In an interview with the Casper Star-Tribune recently, Mead questioned the legality of transferring federal lands in the first place. He also wondered how his state would pay for things like battling wildfires, a bill that's usually picked up by the federal government. State Sen. Larry Hicks, who's pushing the amendment, says he's done the math. He says an energy-rich state like Wyoming can afford to take over the land because of the increased tax revenues the state will be able to reap from it. \"We run about a $3 billion budget and we're sending a billion dollars of federal minerals back to Washington, D.C.,\" Hicks says. \"That's a 25 percent increase in our state revenues right off the bat.\" His math may not take into account the booms and busts of natural resource prices. But for Hicks, this is about a lot more than economics. It's a cultural battle. He says rural communities that depend on mining, logging and drilling on federal lands are suffering. \"A lot of people just feel like they have no more voice,\" he says. People are moving out and schools are shutting down. Hicks says the federal government is too restrictive. \"It's detrimental,\" he says. \"There are multiple generations of families and they feel like that their heritage and their lifestyle has been stolen from them.\" Republican or Democrat, bashing the federal government is popular political sport in Wyoming. And like any relationship, Wyoming's relationship with Washington, D.C. is complicated. In quite a few small towns here, the federal government is the largest employer. And the state depends heavily on federal dollars for everything from highways to health care to education. A report commissioned by the legislature's own committee considering the constitutional amendment noted that if the transfer goes forward, the state would automatically lose close to $30 million in federal dollars earmarked for infrastructure in counties that have large amounts of non-taxable federal public land. \"I see very little evidence that there's a groundswell of support for it in the state of Wyoming,\" says Greg Cawley, a political science professor at the University of Wyoming. Cawley has studied anti-federal government movements in the West, dating back to the Sagebrush Rebellion in the 1970s. \"Every time the federal government does something that irritates Western ranchers, miners, what have you, this issue of transfer of the lands to the states is brought up again, dusted off and put forward,\" he says. But there's one big thing that makes this time around a little different, according to Cawley: the unpredictable political mood in the country right now. For a lot of Westerners, that hit home a few days before the election when a jury acquitted militia leader Ammon Bundy and his followers who led an armed occupation of a federal wildlife refuge in Oregon. The Bundys said they were protesting federal ownership of public land. \"What we used to call, maybe five or six years ago, the fringe right ... they're starting to become more mainstream now,\" says Buzz Hettick of BHA. \"That's why we have to really ramp up the pressure we put on our politicians.\" Hettick pledges that sportsmen will pressure Washington in even bigger numbers if the federal lands transfer proposal moves forward in Congress. But today, out in the Laramie range, he's focused on a smaller quest. He's hopped out of his pickup and set up his scoping lens on a tripod. \"If you look over at the top of this hill right over here ... looks to be at least eight or 10 elk right there,\" he says, his jaw a little clenched from the cold wind. The trip out here can be notched as a success. There are elk in these hills, maybe he'll bag one just yet this season.",

            "article_content": "President Donald Trump lumped the protestors who objected to the removal of a statue of General Robert E. Lee in Charlottesville, Va., in with counter-protesters.  AUDIE CORNISH, HOST: President Trump used a new term at his press conference yesterday - alt-left. (SOUNDBITE OF PRESS CONFERENCE) PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: What about the alt-left that came charging at the, as you say, the alt-right? Do they have any semblance of guilt? CORNISH: He blamed both sides for the violence in Charlottesville, Va., over the weekend. Critics say this language creates a moral equivalence between the alt-right, many of whose members espouse a white nationalist ideology, and the counter-protesters who oppose them. Brian Mann of North Country Public Radio has been reporting on this issue. He joins us now. And Brian, first of all, you and I have talked a couple of times about the alt-right. Is there such thing as the alt-left? BRIAN MANN, BYLINE: Well, it is really hard to lump all of these very different counter-protest groups under that umbrella. Most of them aren't nearly as radical as Donald Trump is implying there. In fact it's a tiny minority. Another crucial difference here of course is that groups on the left aren't based or organized around an ideology of racial supremacy, and that is a core idea and an increasingly mainstream idea within the alt-right. But there are some superficial ways that these groups resemble each other. They're often using social media strategies to recruit members and to organize. They deeply distrust mainstream political culture in the U.S. And there are fringe elements on both sides willing to engage in violence. CORNISH: Now, we also heard this alluded to in a response to the president's remarks. Former Klansman David Duke tweeted, thanks to President Trump for having the courage to, quote, \"condemn the leftist terrorists and BLM Antifa,\" BLM meaning Black Lives Matters and pairing them up with anti-fascists. Now, how do Black Lives Matters activists feel about being portrayed in this way, the moral equivalent of neo-Nazis? MANN: Well, first, that comparison just doesn't work factually. Black Lives Matter has sparked controversy occasionally with its tactics and its rhetoric. But you know, neo-Nazis and the Klan have a long, well-documented history of terrorism, of lynchings, blowing up churches, assassinating elected officials, murdering civil rights activists and police. And so, you know, that's a long history there that the black lives matter just isn't on the same continuum. We reached out to April Goggans - she's a Black Lives Matter activist - to get her sense of the president's framing. APRIL GOGGANS: Black Lives Matter is an easy target. It's something that's visible, something that people know what it is and have their own, you know, ideas about what it means to them. But you just have to ask also, who is it that is saying this message, David Duke? I think the only people who lend credence to anything that he says (laughter) are his followers. CORNISH: I want to talk more about the other name that was mentioned, the Antifa, or anti-fascists. This group is controversial. They have engaged in violent clashes, including there in Charlottesville. But most Americans are only learning about them now. Who are they? MANN: Well, they're definitely the most militant part of the left-wing street movement that's grown over the last few years. They often wear masks. They carry improvised weapons. I've spoken to law enforcement repeatedly since Donald Trump's election, and they are really worried about this small fraction of the left-wing street movement. I asked Daryle Lamont Jenkins about this. He's an Antifa activist who often speaks for the movement. DARYLE LAMONT JENKINS: Antifa was armed just as much as the Nazis were. And we did so because we knew that this was where it was going to go. MANN: He's talking there about the clash in Charlottesville. And one final thing, Audie - I do think there's a lot of evidence now that these two elements of America's political culture are kind of feeding on each other. I've heard a lot of talk since Charlottesville that both sides want to get back out on the streets. And I think wherever you find neo-Nazis and the Klan, you're also very likely to find Antifa and other counter-protesters. CORNISH: Brian Mann is with North Country Public Radio. Brian, thank you.
