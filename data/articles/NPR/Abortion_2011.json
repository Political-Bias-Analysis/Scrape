            "article_content": " Texas Gov. Rick Perry at the Values Voter Summit 2011, Oct. 7, 2011 in Washington, DC.  Texas Gov. Rick Perry at the Values Voter Summit 2011, Oct. 7, 2011 in Washington, DC. Texas Gov. Rick Perry used an appearance Friday before the Values Voter Summit, an annual  gathering of more than 3,000 Christian conservatives to suggest that his chief  opponent in the race for the Republican presidential nomination is a  fair-weather cultural conservative. Though Perry didn't mention former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney by  name, both he and the prominent Dallas pastor who introduced him suggested that  Romney was not the real deal when it comes to issues dear to the heart of social  and cultural conservatives. \"For some candidates,\" Perry said to a nearly packed hotel ballroom in  Washington, being pro-life \"is an election year slogan.\" Romney has famously shifted his position from supporting abortion under  some circumstances, to opposing it. Perry, in a speech that was equal parts about jobs, national security and  abortion, touted his record as governor, including requiring that women seeking  to terminate a pregnancy undergo a sonogram. His biggest applause line: that he signed a state budget that ended  funding for Planned Parenthood, an organization that provides family planning  and, at some clinics, abortion services. Perry has in recent days doubled down on comparing Romney to President  Obama. And Friday, the Rev. Robert Jeffress of the Dallas First Baptist Church  and his pastor took up the narrative in introducing the Texas  governor. Jeffress, who has not previously endorsed a candidate, said Christian  conservatives have a choice. \"Do we want a candidate who is  skilled in rhetoric, or one who is skilled in leadership? Do we want someone who  is a conservative out of convenience, or one who is a conservative out of  conviction?,\" he said. \"Do we want a candidate who is a good, moral person, or  one who is a born-again follower of Jesus Christ?\" Jeffress appeared to touch on the discomfort some conservative Christians  have over Romney's Mormon faith. Perry received a polite, if not overly enthusiastic reaction from an  audience who may feel their own discomfort over his support of a vaccine that  inoculates girls against HPV, a sexual transmitted disease that can cause  cervical cancer. He did not raise the issue. Rick Santorum was the  first of seven GOP presidential candidates scheduled to speak to address the  gathering. He elicited laughter by joking that he has a better tax plan than fellow  candidate Herman Cain's \"9-9-9\" proposal. \"It's the zero, zero, zero plan,\" he said. No corporate income tax, Santorum said, and repeal of regulations put in  place by President Obama. Popular with Christian conservatives, Santorum's staunch anti-abortion  message was warmly received. Flanked on the stage by his wife and children, he recounted a  moving story of the death of one of their children shortly after birth. \"I am committed,\" he said, \"to the cause of life and family and American  exceptionalism.\"",

Michele Bachmann (R-MN), who signed a pledge against abortion rights, and businessman Herman Cain, who has not, seen at the taping of a radio show in New Hampshire in May. OK, this shouldn't come as much of a surprise. But the abortion-rights group NARAL Pro-Choice America says that none of the declared Republican candidates for president \u2014 nor any of those thought to be waiting in the wings \u2014 would pass muster with voters who support a woman's right to choose. \"They're all equally unacceptable,\" said Donna Crane, the group's policy director, at a briefing to release a thick briefing book detailing the reproductive-health records of a dozen Republicans who are or could be running to challenge President Obama in 2012. \"The outcome of the 2012 presidential election could very well determine whether abortion remains legal and accessible for the next generation of American women,\" she said. An updated report accompanying the background briefing book details all the powers of a president when it comes to reproductive health care, including the power to appoint Supreme Court justices and lower court judges, the power to issue executive orders, and the power to appoint executive branch officials who oversee health and judicial agencies. And while all the declared candidates, plus Texas Gov. Rick Perry and former Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin, say they are anti-abortion, \"most of the major candidates have (also) been on record saying they're in favor of defunding Planned Parenthood,\" said NARAL Deputy General Counsel Lissy Moskowitz. In fact, this cycle's crop of GOP candidates is similar to the 2008 field in that all except former New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani (whose record was unclear, according to  NARAL) are avowedly anti-abortion. There is a big difference from 2008, however, when it comes to birth control. For the first time, many, if not most of the candidates have come out not just for the defunding of Planned Parenthood (which is at least arguably about abortion). Some have also voted against \u2014 and spoken out against \u2014 any kind of federal funding for contraception. NARAL officials didn't rank the candidates in order of disapproval. The point of the exercise, said Ted Miller, the group's communications director, is to educate the public about the particulars of the candidates' views. Back in 2008, he said, the group's report on the history of GOP presidential candidate John McCain's record on reproductive health was critical, \"because many people assumed that he was a moderate maverick. And they interpreted that phrase to mean pro-choice.\" But, in fact, he has opposed abortion rights. As you might expect, those on the other side of the abortion debate find any of the prospective GOP challengers preferable to the incumbent. \"No one is as pro-abortion as Barack Obama,\" says Ciara Matthews, communications director for the conservative Susan B. Anthony List. That group has asked candidates to sign a pledge vowing to nominate only anti-abortion candidates to judgeships and top executive branch positions, as well as to defund Planned Parenthood \"and all other contractors and recipients of federal funds with affiliates that perform or fund abortions.\" So far, six candidates, including Reps. Michele Bachmann and former Minnesota Gov. Tim Pawlenty, have signed the group's pledge. Three candidates have formally declined: former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney, former pizza executive Herman Cain, and former Utah Gov. Jon Huntsman. All three still call themselves anti-abortion. While Matthews said the group isn't picking and choosing favorites among the field, \"we'd certainly take a non-pledge signer over Barack Obama.\"",

            "article_content": "As predicted by those on both sides of the contentious abortion battle, states in the first half of this year have enacted a record 162 new laws or changes to existing laws that affect reproductive health, according to a new report from the Guttmacher Institute. According to the report, the 80 new abortion restrictions already in 2011 are more than double the previous annual record of 34 seen in 2005, and more than triple 2010's 23 changes. The changes weren't that hard to see coming, given the election in 2010 of anti-abortion governors and majorities in more than half the states. In fact, according to the Guttmacher report, all of this year's changes came from just 19 states. Most dramatic were bills seeking to ban abortion altogether. Five states passed laws that outlaw the procedure after 20 weeks gestation, which appears to be in conflict with existing Supreme Court precedent that forbids abortion bans prior to viability, which is several weeks later than that. An Ohio bill that has passed that state's House would ban abortion as soon as a fetal heartbeat can be detected, which is around eight weeks gestation. The measure is currently before the Ohio Senate. By far the most popular measures were to ban abortion coverage in the new insurance exchanges where individuals and small businesses will be able to shop for coverage starting in 2014. Eight states passed laws banning the sale of policies in the insurance exchanges that offer coverage of abortion; four of those laws (in Kansas, Nebraska, Oklahoma, and Utah) would extend the ban to all private insurance coverage offered in the state. Five states moved to restrict family planning funding to specific providers, most notably Planned Parenthood, although some of those efforts have been blocked by various courts.",

            "article_content": "The nation's abortion wars, simmering but largely quiet in recent years, have begun boiling again. Nowhere has the battle been more pitched than in Kansas, where the Legislature this session passed four anti-abortion measures and attempted to  adopt strict new licensing rules that this week came within hours of closing down the state's last abortion provider. Becky Kolb, an X-ray technician trained in obstetric ultrasound, shows an exam room where technicians give sonograms at the Alpha Center in Sioux Falls, S.D., last April. On Thursday, a federal judge blocked a new South Dakota law that would require women to undergo counseling and wait 72 hours before getting an abortion.\n                \n                    \n                    Dirk Lammers/AP\n                    \n                \nhide caption Becky Kolb, an X-ray technician trained in obstetric ultrasound, shows an exam room where technicians give sonograms at the Alpha Center in Sioux Falls, S.D., last April. On Thursday, a federal judge blocked a new South Dakota law that would require women to undergo counseling and wait 72 hours before getting an abortion. Late Thursday, Kansas officials agreed to license Planned Parenthood's Overland Park surgical facility, which provides abortions, after the organization scrambled to comply with the week-old clinic rules by Friday's deadline. That deadline was annulled Friday when a federal judge blocked the new licensing laws. For anti-abortion groups, 2011 has been a \"banner year,\" says Marjorie Dannenfelser of the Susan B. Anthony List, which raises money for female candidates who oppose abortion. \"The pro-life movement has been active but subterranean for awhile,\" she says. \"Now we have the strongest pro-life caucus in the U.S. House that I've ever seen, and state legislatures have changed as well.\" Statistics compiled by NARAL Pro-Choice America show that 29 governors \u2014 including Kansan Sam Brownback \u2014 now oppose abortion, up from 21 before the 2010 elections. And 19 states have House and Senate memberships that are \"solidly\" opposed to abortion, up from 16 last year. Eight states have what NARAL characterizes as \"solidly pro-choice\" legislatures, down from 10. Elections Matter Hundreds of anti-abortion measures, driven by new conservative majorities in statehouses across the country, were advanced during legislative sessions that have just wrapped up. Now we have the strongest pro-life caucus in the U.S. House that I've ever seen, and state legislatures have changed as well. Marjorie Dannenfelser, Susan B. Anthony List By NARAL's count, 470 anti-abortion measures were taken up by states in 2011 as of June 28, up from 175 in 2010. Efforts ranged from denying funds to Planned Parenthood because some of its family planning clinics also provide abortion procedures to a bill passed this week by the Ohio House of Representatives that would prohibit abortions after a fetal heartbeat is detected. The Ohio effort is considered the most direct assault on the 1973 Supreme Court decision in Roe v. Wade, which legalized abortion before a fetus is considered viable, or able to survive outside the womb. The so-called \"heartbeat bill\" could ban abortions much earlier \u2014 as little as six weeks into a pregnancy, and before some women are even aware they've conceived, say supporters of legal abortion. Six states have also enacted \"fetal pain\" laws, which restrict abortions after 20 weeks of pregnancy. Anti-abortion activists argue that fetuses can feel pain at that point; there is currently no medical consensus about the stage of development at which fetuses experience pain. The heartbeat and fetal pain efforts, as well as new state laws requiring abortion clinics to show women sonograms of their fetuses, are a potent new tactic advanced by the anti-abortion movement. \"There should be no mystery that our goal is the end of abortion because it's the taking of a human life,\" Dannenfelser says. \"And science-based arguments are often the ones that rule the day \u2014 the measures of pain, when you can hear a heartbeat, see a sonogram.\" \"These give us our best chance,\" she says. Kansas Fight In Kansas, anti-abortion advocates used the full menu of tactics to limit access to and funding of abortion procedures. Last session, the Legislature passed a law to eliminate Planned Parenthood's access to federal family planning funds. It voted to prohibit insurance companies from providing abortion coverage unless it comes in a separate rider. According to NARAL Pro-Choice America, 470 anti-abortion measures were taken up by states in 2011. As of June 27, NARAL tallied the following: It approved a measure that requires a minor seeking an abortion to provide notarized consent from both parents. And legislators agreed to a fetal pain bill, modeled after the first such measure passed last year in Nebraska. But it was the licensing power of the state's once-obscure Rules and Regulations Board that almost closed the doors of the last clinic providing abortions in Kansas. The state is where Dr. George Tiller, prominent abortion provider and proponent of a woman's right to a safe and legal procedure, was shot to death while attending church two years ago. \"This is the most sustained and radical assault on health care and on women that I have seen in 35 years,\" says Peter Brownlie, who heads Planned Parenthood of Kansas and Mid-Missouri. He characterized the new clinic rules as \"confusing, unnecessary and burdensome.\" Brownlie said his organization received the new regulations on July 20, and was inspected by the state for compliance two days later. The regulations included the mandatory stocking of items and medications the clinic doesn't typically use (like activated charcoal), as well as medical equipment for the delivery of full-term babies. \"One of the most ludicrous aspects of the regulations was a host of requirements for providing emergency care to a viable newborn child,\" Brownlie said. \"We never do abortions after viability.\" But the clinic procured the required medications and equipment, and the activated charcoal, and obtained the license. Two other private abortion providers denied licenses asked the court to allow them to stay open while they attempted to comply; a judge on Friday temporarily blocked the state from enforcing the new rules until a lawsuit challenging them is settled. \"The governor of Kansas and legislative leaders in the Republican Party remain committed to eliminating access to abortion care in Kansas,\" Brownlie says. As it should be, Dannenfelser says. \"We're right in the sweet spot with public opinion,\" she says. Dannenfelser's organization has pressed Republican presidential candidates to sign an anti-abortion pledge \u2014 a step the hopefuls except Mitt Romney and Jon Huntsman have taken. Fight Continues Outside Kansas, at least one more of the restrictive new state laws has already been blocked in court. A federal judge ruled Thursday ruled that a Planned Parenthood challenge to South Dakota's law requiring that women seeking an abortion wait 72 hours and meet with an anti-abortion counselor would very likely succeed, and granted an injunction preventing the measure from going into effect. This is the most sustained and radical assault on health care and on women that I have seen in 35 years. Peter Brownlie, Planned Parenthood of Kansas and Mid-Missouri The judge characterized the new law as creating a \"substantial obstacle to a woman's decision to obtain an abortion.\" In Texas, a state law that would require, as of Sept. 1, that women seeking abortions view a sonogram of the fetus has also been challenged in federal court by the Center for Reproductive Rights. Abortion-rights advocates are also watching Capitol Hill, where Republican lawmakers have been attempting to tack anti-abortion amendments onto unrelated legislation. Utah Sen. Orrin Hatch, under attack back home by Tea Party conservatives, this week tried to add one abortion-related amendment to a Korean trade agreement. It would prohibit health organizations that provide abortion services from receiving federal family-planning money. For now, the war continues. \"What Hatch did is beyond disturbing,\" says NARAL's Ted Miller, \"and a sign of things to come.\" In the House, by NARAL's count, there are 246 anti-abortion votes and 155 members who support legal abortion. \"This just underscores the importance of elections,\" he says. On that, he and Dannenfelser agree.",

Talking politics is, in some ways, like talking baseball.  You talk about the history, the lore, the stats, the trivia.  And you remember when barriers are broken. So, just as Jackie Robinson of the Brooklyn Dodgers was the first African-American to break into the major leagues, you know that John F. Kennedy was the first Catholic president.  Douglas Wilder of Virginia was the first black to be elected governor.  And Geraldine Ferraro was the first woman named to a major-party presidential ticket. Ferraro, picked in 1984 by Democratic presidential nominee Walter Mondale to be his running mate, died Saturday at age 75.  The former three-term House member from Queens, New York, had long been suffering from multiple myeloma, a type of blood cancer. Saying that barriers have been broken does not mean that roadblocks are gone.  Barack Obama's election as president in 2008 hardly means that racism has disappeared from the American scene.  And while Ferraro's ascension to the ticket in 1984 (duplicated 24 years later by Republican Sarah Palin), as well as Hillary Clinton's strong bid for the Democratic presidential nomination in 2008, indicated a sea change for the political success of women, evidence of sexism still permeates political discourse. But everybody who remembers the announcement made that summer day in 1984 immediately knew its significance.  And it happened less than six years after she broke into electoral politics. Geraldine Ferraro was an assistant district attorney in the borough of Queens when she decided to run for an open congressional seat in 1978.  She had far less experience than the other Democrats who sought the nomination, but her Italian background and her familiar name \u2014 her cousin, Nicholas Ferraro, was the Queens D.A. \u2014 boosted her in both the primary and the general election.  A strong advocate of abortion rights, she became an influential member of the House early in her career; in 1981, she joined her party's leadership as secretary of the Democratic Caucus. In the spring of 1984, she attained national prominence as chair of the Democratic Party platform committee.  On July 12, Mondale made his historic announcement in St. Paul, Minnesota. Some were dubious about the move, attributing it to Mondale's desire to \"pander to pressure groups.\"  Others were ecstatic.  It's a \"dream come true,\" effused Stephanie Solien of the Women's Campaign Fund.  Gloria Steinem, a leading feminist, dismissed the doubters:  \"Half the human race is not a special interest.\"  Ferraro, who liked to describe herself as a \"Queens housewife,\" understood the importance: \"American history is about doors being opened, doors of opportunity for everyone no matter who you are, as long as you're willing to earn it.\" The mood at the party convention four days later was electric from the start.  To this day, I remember the tears of joy in the eyes of women everywhere in the hall at San Francisco's Moscone Center.  But the euphoria did not last long; questions about the financial transactions of her husband, real estate attorney John Zaccaro, dominated the news for weeks.  In the end, the Mondale-Ferraro ticket lost 49 out of 50 states to the Republican ticket of President Ronald Reagan and Vice President George Bush. Ultimately, having Ferraro on the ticket made little difference in the 1984 results.  But it was clear that something important had transpired that day when Mondale made his historic selection. Ferraro never attained high office again.  In 1992 and again in 1998, she lost Democratic primaries in her bid to face GOP Sen. Al D'Amato.  She appeared in a much-ridiculed commercial for Diet Pepsi. In March 2008, she resigned from the Hillary Clinton presidential campaign, where she was part of the finance effort, when she in effect said that Barack Obama was doing very well in the primaries because he was black: \"If Obama was a white man, he would not be in this position. And if he was a woman, he would not be in this position. He happens to be very lucky to be who he is. And the country is caught up in the concept.\" Ferraro accused her critics of a double standard on race: \"Any time anybody does anything that in any way pulls this [Obama] campaign down and says let's address reality and the problems we're facing in this world, you're accused of being racist, so you have to shut up,\" she told the Daily Breeze of Torrance, Calif. \"Racism works in two different directions. I really think they're attacking me because I'm white. How's that?\"",

And some of the debate goes back even further than that, like the fight over legal abortion, which now extends back decades. Thursday evening witnessed some passionate debate over federal funding of Planned Parenthood services in light of efforts by some members of the House GOP to defund Title X of the Public Health Service Act. The debate included Rep. Jackie Speier (D-CA) telling of how she had an abortion. Fox News' America's Election HQ blog reports: Just before Speier assumed the floor, Rep. Chris Smith (R-NJ), one of the most ardent anti-abortion voices in Congress, spent several minutes reading explicit descriptions of what happened to one woman when she had an abortion. \"I planned to speak about something else. But the gentleman from New Jersey just put my stomach in knots,\" Speier began. \"I'm one of those women he spoke about just now. I had a procedure at 17 weeks pregnant with a child who moved from the vagina into the cervix. The procedure you just described is the procedure I endured.\" Hushed conversations in the back of the chamber between aides and lawmakers ceased as Speier made the declaration to her colleagues. \"For you to stand on this floor and suggest that somehow this is a procedure that is either welcomed or done cavalierly, is preposterous,\" Speier said to Smith. The vote on the Title X defunding amendment is expected Friday.",

Just one day after Republican leaders pushed through the House a measure to repeal the entire health law, a measure unlikely to even be considered by the Senate, they were back before the cameras, introducing legislation that would permanently bar any taxpayer subsidies for abortion. \"A ban on taxpayer funding of abortion is the will of the people, and it ought to be the will of the land,\" House Speaker John Boehner (R-OH) said. The legislation, called the \"No Taxpayer Funding for Abortion Act,\" is sponsored by Rep. Chris Smith (R-NJ), the longtime chairman of the House Pro-Life Caucus. Smith says the bill would write into permanent law existing abortion restrictions that Congress has to currently renew every year. \"Our new bill is designed to permanently end any U.S. government financial support for abortion, whether it be direct funding or by tax credits or any other subsidy,\" he said. This isn't the first time Smith has tried to make permanent various annual abortion restrictions. But this year is different. His bill has been officially designated HR 3, signaling that it's a top priority for the GOP leadership. Abortion-rights supporters say the new Republican majority is overplaying its hand by making restricting abortion a priority. \"The 2010 elections were about jobs and the economy,\" said Nancy Keenan, president of NARAL Pro-Choice America. \"It was not an endorsement of an anti-choice agenda.\" Both the federal court in Virginia and the Ohio Elections Commission determined that the claim that the [health law] funds abortion is false. So the question is not whether we're going to strip abortion funding from health care reform. The question is how much further Congress is willing to go to remove tax subsidies for abortion coverage that is currently available. Timothy Jost, Washington and Lee University But Smith's bill isn't even the only major piece of abortion legislation that is likely to get an early vote in the House. Rep Joe Pitts (R-PA), another longtime abortion opponent, now leads the health subcommittee of the House Energy and Commerce Committee. He has a bill, the \"Protect Life Act,\" that he says would close loopholes in the health law that allow abortion funding. \"They've opened the proverbial floodgates for federal money to pour into abortion services, and with it they've incentivized an extremely controversial practice,\" Pitts said at a separate news conference Thursday. \"This is simply not acceptable.\" But whether the health law actually does allow federal abortion funding is still the subject of a heated debate. While abortion opponents say it does, abortion-rights groups say it does not. Not only that \u2014 supporters of abortion rights say the law actually puts new restrictions on the procedure. That's because it requires women to buy separate insurance policies if they want abortion coverage provided by their insurance plan. \"Eighty-seven percent of plans sold in this country today do include abortion coverage as a standard benefit,\" said Donna Crane, NARAL's policy director. \"It's basically sort of the industry standard.\" Other surveys have found abortion coverage less pervasive than that, but still widespread. And it's not just abortion-rights groups that say the law didn't expand abortion access. Timothy Jost, a law professor at Washington and Lee  University and a prominent anti-abortion voice, says what many Republicans are saying about the law and abortion is simply not so. \"Both the federal court in Virginia and the Ohio Elections Commission determined that the claim that the [health law] funds abortion is false,\" Jost said. \"So the question is not whether we're going to strip abortion funding from health care reform. The question is how much further Congress is willing to go to remove tax subsidies for abortion coverage that is currently available.\" Jost is referring to the fact that Smith's bill would do more than just write into law existing abortion restrictions. It would also eliminate tax benefits for insurance policies that cover abortion \u2014 even abortions in most cases of medical necessity. NARAL's Crane says the effect could be far-reaching. \"If you are a health insurance plan and you are selling your product, and all of a sudden it becomes that much more expensive because there are tax penalties imposed on it, you're probably going to change the nature of your product, and in this case we're quite certain that Chris Smith intends for health insurance plans to drop their abortion coverage,\" Crane said. Unlike the bill to repeal the entire health law, which is given basically no chance of passing the Senate, anti-abortion legislation is seen as having a good chance. That's because many Democrats in that chamber oppose abortion rights, too.",

            "article_content": "Republican presidential hopeful Mitt Romney has asserted his opposition to abortion rights in recent years, which has lead some to wonder about his earlier views.\n                \n                    \n                    Manuel Balce Ceneta/AP\n                    \n                \nhide caption Republican presidential hopeful Mitt Romney has asserted his opposition to abortion rights in recent years, which has lead some to wonder about his earlier views. Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney has been labeled a flip-flopper. And when it comes to abortion, the former governor of Massachusetts appears to have changed his position from being in favor of abortion rights to being opposed. But now some people are asking if Romney ever supported abortion rights at all? Backers of abortion rights don't think so. \"In Massachusetts, when he was running for governor...a very liberal state, a state that was pro-choice, he was playing to the audience,\" says Nancy Keenan, President of NARAL Pro-Choice America. \"And he made promises to the pro-choice community at that time that he did not keep,\" she said, including vetoing a bill that would have provided emergency contraceptives to victims of rape. \"So the fact of the matter is he was not authentic in his position at that time.\" During that 2002 run, Romney insisted in a debate, \"I will preserve and protect a woman's right to choose, and am devoted and dedicated to honoring my word in that regard.\" Putting a point on it, he said, \"I will not change any provisions of Massachusetts' pro-choice laws.\" Eight years earlier, in 1994, when Romney unsuccessfully challenged the late Sen. Edward Kennedy, he had been even stronger on the issue: \"I believe that abortion should be safe and legal in this country; I have since the time that my mom took that position when she ran in 1970 as a U.S. Senate candidate,\" he said during that year's debate. \"I believe that since Roe v. Wade has been the law for 20 years, that we should sustain and support it.\" That prompted Kennedy to say, \"I am pro-choice. My opponent is multiple choice.\" But today's Romney is clearly anti-abortion. \"I'd make sure that the progress that has been made to provide for life and to protect human life is not progress that would be reversed,\" he told former Arkansas governor and a former GOP presidential candidate Mike Huckabee on Fox News in October. \"My view is that the Supreme Court should reverse Roe v. Wade and send back to the states the responsibility for deciding whether they're going to have abortion legal in their state or not.\" So what happened? According to Romney, he changed his mind about abortion in 2004, during a fight in Massachusetts over embryonic stem cell research. In November of that year, he met with Harvard's Douglas Melton, a prominent embryonic stem cell researcher to discuss the issue. \"The story goes that he was put off by the cavalier way the medical researcher talked about disposing of excess frozen embryos,\" says Ron Scott, a journalist and distant cousin of the candidate who is the author of a new biography, Mitt Romney: An Inside Look at the Man and His Politics. Scott says that meeting is what led Romney to change his mind on abortion. \"I'm not sure of all the intricacies therein, but it was a moment for him apparently,\" he says. Only there's a problem with Romney's story. The candidate has said repeatedly that Melton used the word \"killing\" to describe what happens to two-week old embryos in order to proceed with the research. Melton has repeatedly denied ever using such language. \"The record shows that the then governor and I have a distinctly different recollection of the meeting and our conversation,\" he wrote in an email to NPR. Romney's campaign didn't respond to repeated requests for comment. Whatever happened in that meeting, however, from that point on Romney became significantly more opposed to abortion. Keenan says his 2005 veto of a bill to provide the so-called morning-after pill to rape victims made him even more anti-abortion than other governors who also ended up in this year's GOP presidential field. \"Pawlenty and Huntsman actually signed those bills,\" she said, referring to the former Minnesota and Utah governors Tim Pawlenty and Jon Huntsman. \"So you can see that he is to the right (of them) and very anti-choice.\" Romney biographer Scott says Romney never actually changed his personal position, simply his emphasis. \"The truth of the matter is he personally had been pro-life throughout all of this,\" Scott says. \"He simply had modified his position in 1994 and 2002\" so that he was able to remain personally anti-abortion, \"but...allow other people to make decisions for themselves.\" But the question is if Romney now believes that abortion should truly be illegal, is it enough for the base of his party? \"I believe he is a true convert,\" says Marjorie Dannenfelser, President of the Susan B. Anthony List. \"I'm a convert to this position as well, and we ought to always be in a position of welcoming people to our side, which I do.\" Still, earlier this summer the group asked all the GOP candidates to sign a pledge supporting a series of positions. Romney was one of a handful who declined to sign, and with Herman Cain's recent signature, has become the only major holdout. Romney's campaign said at the time the pledge would limit who he could appoint to some key positions in his administration. Dannenfelser says she's still disappointed. And she says Romney still has more work to do to convince doubters that he'll need to win the Republican nomination. \"Honestly anyone can wear the sticker that says 'pro-life,' \" she says. \"What really matters is the fililng out of the content of what that means. And your leadership is what will show that.\"",

Voters may not see the world in the same black and white tones you do. That seems to be the underlying message voters sent during this off-year election. On Tuesday evening, issues that were spun up by ideologues \u2014 the weakening of public-employee labor unions in Ohio; the \"personhood\" initiative in Mississippi, and the crackdown on illegal immigrants in Arizona \u2014 all got the back of the hand from voters. Ohio voters also resoundingly voted for a ballot measure to opt out of the Affordable Care Act's individual mandate though that vote was largely symbolic since the state has to obey the federal law, regardless, thanks to the Constitution's Supremacy Clause. That anti-ACA vote could be construed as an anti-ideology vote, too, since many voters believe the Obama administration and congressional Democrats operated from a bias towards big government when they enacted the controversial legislation. Seemingly after every election in which one party wins decisively (and sometimes when the victory is less than decisive, like the 2004 presidential election)  there's a tendency for the winners to claim a mandate for bold action. That clearly happened after the 2010 wave election which saw Republicans recapture the U.S. House with many seats to spare and increase control of statehouses. It also occurred after the 2008 election with President Obama's impressive Electoral College win. The  problem is, election results can be a political Rorschach test  where voters and politicians wind up seeing different  things. Voters may just be voting for a change, expressing their unhappiness with the status quo. The winning party, however, especially its ideologues, takes the win as voters signing off on the victors' agenda, a variation of \"to the winner, goes the spoils.\" They seem to forget that the U.S. is essentially a center-right nation except for those times when it's essentially center-left. So you get Ohio Republican Gov. John Kasich after winning election last November enacting Senate Bill 5 in Ohio which stripped public employee unions of collective bargaining rights and more. Then, only a few months later voters collectively say: \"That's not what we meant.\" Or you get Mississippi which last November flipped from a congressional delegation of three Democrats and one Republican to three Republicans and one Democrat. The sense of conservative ascent helped create the atmosphere that times were conducive for a constitutional amendment that would define human life as beginning at the instant of fertilization, a law which would have made abortion illegal in the state and even threatened in vitro fertilization and certain forms of birth control. As in Ohio, however, voters in Mississippi, too, seemed to say Tuesday night: \"That's not what we meant.\" Tuesday's results were arguably the latest warning for politicians and party activists that mandates aren't all they're cracked up to be. If there was a message heading into 2012, voters seemed to be telling politicians to stop drinking their own Kool-Aid. Instead, with every poll indicating that voters want policymakers to focus on repairing the economy and creating the best possible climate for job growth, Tuesday was about sending the message that politicians ignore this priority of the American people at their own risk.",

            "article_content": " Newt Gingrich is introduced before the start of a Republican presidential debate earlier this month in Las Vegas.The former House speaker is hoping for a surge after a highly anticipated Iowa caucus poll is released this weekend. Former House Speaker Newt Gingrich remains a long shot for the Republican presidential  nomination. He's been  polling a distant fourth in Iowa, New Hampshire and South  Carolina, as well as in pivotal, winner-take-all Florida \u2014 all contests  that will play out in January. His  campaign faced hurdles, many self-imposed, from the start. Most of his staff  quit during the campaign's early weeks, after which he and his wife, Callista,  went on a vacation cruise. And his claims of personal frugality were undercut by  revelations that he maintained a $1 million-plus credit line at Tiffany &  Co. Critics  suggest that Gingrich has been using his desultory  presidential run simply to build his personal brand and to sell his books,  the latest an examination of \"American  exceptionalism.\" But could  Gingrich be poised to become the latest alternative to former Massachusetts Gov.  Mitt Romney, who has consistently been at or near the top of the polls, but has  struggled to corral the party's Tea Party and evangelical Christian  base? A strong  hint may come Saturday night, when the Des Moines Register releases its  much-anticipated GOP 2012 caucus poll, its first new survey since July. If  Gingrich's message has legs, it would likely be in Iowa. The state's GOP caucus-goers in the 2008  presidential primary season were the most conservative in the nation. And there  is strong overlap between the state's small-government, Tea Party conservatives and voters who identify themselves as evangelical  Christians. The former  speaker has also been among the most consistent, and  consistently on message, of the candidates when stating a case for ousting  President Obama and envisioning a post-Obama White House agenda \u2014 especially when  compared with the sometimes stumbling, frequently back-walking performances of front-runners Romney, businessman Herman Cain, and, further back, Texas Gov. Rick Perry. \"He has  articulated better than anyone else a vision that is comfortable for  social-first conservatives and for fiscal-first conservatives,\" says John  Stineman, a Republican strategist in Iowa. \"He does it at every debate,  too.\" He has articulated better than anyone else a vision that is comfortable for social-first conservatives and for fiscal-first conservatives. He does it at every debate, too. John Stineman, Iowa strategist Take his  appearance last weekend at a gathering of the Iowa Faith and Freedom Coalition,  a staunchly conservative Christian group that wields influence among the  Hawkeye  State's GOP caucus-goers. You might think that the  thrice-married Gingrich, who converted to Catholicism in 2009, would be a hard sell with these social conservatives. But Gingrich was the only one  of the six presidential contenders at the event to bring the crowd to its feet  with a history-saturated call-to-arms, and a presidential agenda that featured a  laundry list of executive orders on issues ranging from abortion to Israel. \"2012 is  the most important election in this country since 1860,\" Gingrich told the crowd  in Des Moines,  referring to the year slavery was the burning issue and Abraham Lincoln was  elected. Next year  is when voters will decide, he said, whether to \"repudiate an 80-year drift to  the left.\" Like his  politics or not, one of Gingrich's problems is that he was never viewed as a  likable politician. He has used  the debate-heavy fall as a free opportunity to attempt to shed some of his  1990s-era baggage as a shrill partisan. He's studiously avoided criticizing his fellow candidates,  with one notable exchange with Romney over health care reform. Instead, he's  turned on debate moderators, accusing them of attempting to get the candidates  to bicker. And he's  worked to position himself as a party eminence. Preview Of GOP Campaign Themes Though his  prospects appear to remain slim, Gingrich's agenda is worth tracking for clues  to areas where Republican candidates expect to gain traction. He was the  first with a tax plan that includes a \"flat tax\" provision.  Cain's 9-9-9 scheme  came later; Perry unveiled his 20-percent flat tax proposal this  week. Gingrich  has also long railed against the power of the nation's judicial branch, a popular Republican issue  once again gaining momentum, says Matt Towery, who was a  chief Gingrich strategist in the 1980s and chaired his political organization  in the 1990s. \"He's been  ahead on judicial reform and way ahead on the tax issue,\" says Towery, a  syndicated conservative columnist and independent pollster. In contrast to Cain, who's been relatively vague about how he might handle a range of issues as president, Gingrich has offered up specifics about what he'd do in the White House. Gingrich  told the receptive crowd in Iowa last weekend that he'd issue executive orders to \"eliminate  all the White House czars,\" reinstate policy prohibiting U.S. money from being  used for international family planning and abortion services, and reinstate a policy  that allows workers to opt out of performing tasks that go against their  religious beliefs. Municipal  clerks who object to same-sex marriage, for example, wouldn't have to issue  licenses in places that have legalized such unions; pharmacists could refuse to  fill certain family planning prescriptions. He would  defund Planned Parenthood, change Medicaid reimbursements to state block grants,  abolish the Energy Department, and replace the Environmental Protection Agency  with what he calls an \"environmental solutions  agency.\" He  characterized Obama's plan to pull all American troops from Iraq by  the end of the year as \"a decisive defeat,\" and says he would instruct national  security officials to \"ignore the three most recent Supreme Court decisions on  terrorism.\" Those  decisions included extending habeas corpus rights to non-citizen detainees at  Guantanamo  Bay, and an American  detainee's right to due process. While that staunchly conservative agenda may appeal to GOP primary voters, those looking beyond January say it has the  potential to scare away general-election voters Republicans need to defeat Obama next  year. Much To Overcome Though  Romney has appeared on a course to capture the nomination, and is \"still the  most likely nominee,\" Towery says, he also argues that Gingrich could be the  \"last man standing\" to challenge the former governor for the  nomination. He  predicted that will happen in December, just before the Jan. 3 Iowa  caucuses. But Towery,  who has known Gingrich for more than three decades, also has a brutally honest  assessment of the man he admires and long worked  for. \"His  weaknesses are myriad,\" Towery says. \"He overthinks things. He's not very good  at running elections.\" At 68, he's older and grayer than all of the candidates,  with the exception of 76-year-old Ron Paul, the Texas congressman. And he lacks the physical  presence and polish of the front-runners. Gingrich, however, has managed  to improve his likability with his debate performances. Gallup found that  Gingrich's \"positive intensity score\" has risen since August to third from sixth among the eight GOP candidates,  well below Cain's, but just about the same as Romney's. His name recognition  remains second only to Romney's. That could be a glimmer of hope for Gingrich, who still hopes he might pull a \"Mike Huckabee\" in Iowa \u2014 the former Arkansas governor emerged from a distant third in the  October 2007 Des Moines Register poll to defeat Romney in Iowa's 2008 GOP caucuses. But if Saturday's poll leaves Gingrich back in the pack, his time for an Iowa surge could be running out.",

            "article_content": " Republican presidential candidate Herman Cain is under fire for comments he made about social issues on Wednesday night.  Republican presidential candidate Herman Cain is under fire for comments he made about social issues on Wednesday night. Part of Herman Cain's appeal to GOP presidential primary voters was that he seemed to have more street cred with social conservatives than the putative front runner, former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney. Doubts about Romney have helped fuel Cain's recent rise in the polls, putting him in a virtual dead-heat with Romney. But in an interview Wednesday night with CNN's Piers Morgan, Cain raised some new questions about his stance on social issues. When Morgan asked the former Godfather's Pizza CEO about his beliefs on abortion and contraception, Cain said he believes life begins at conception and that he supports \"abortion under no circumstances.\" But, according to a CNN transcript, Cain drew a sharp line between his personal beliefs and the role government should play: No, it comes down to it's not the government's role or anybody else's  role to make that decision.  Secondly, if you look at the statistical  incidents, you're not talking about that big a number.  So what I'm  saying is it ultimately gets down to a choice that that family or that  mother has to make. Not me as president, not some politician,  not a bureaucrat.  It gets down to that family.  And whatever they  decide, they decide.  I shouldn't have to tell them what decision to  make for such a sensitive issue. When Morgan pressed him, saying he couldn't hide behind being \"the pizza guy,\" and that, as president, his views would become \"a directive to the nation,\" Cain reiterated his government-hands-off-abortion stance: No they don't.  I can have an opinion on an issue without it  being a directive on the nation.  The government shouldn't be trying to  tell people everything to do, especially when it comes to social  decisions that they need to make. Campaigning in New Hampshire on Thursday, former Pennsylvania Sen. Rick Santorum attacked Cain for misleading conservative voters. \"It's basically the position that just about every pro-choice politician  has in America,\" Santorum told The Associated Press. \"I don't know too  many pro-choice politicians who are for abortion, who want more  abortions ... but they say the decision is a choice the government  shouldn't be involved in.\" In his interview with Morgan, Cain also weighed in on homosexuality, saying he believed it was \"a sin\" and that it was a \"choice\" that gay people make. He continued: That being said, I respect their right to make that choice.  You don't  see me bashing them or anything like that.  I respect their right to  make that choice.  I don't have to agree with it. That's all I'm saying. Cain had also raised doubts about his stance on gay marriage on Meet The Press last Sunday. He said then that while he opposes same-sex marriage, he would not seek a constitutional ban on it \u2014 another position that puts him at odds with social conservatives in his party. Cain tried to end the controversy Thursday with a tweet: \"I'm 100% pro-life. End of story.\" But he may find out it's not so easy to close that chapter this weekend, when he travels to Des Moines to attend the fall banquet of the Faith and Freedom Coalition where he'll take questions from Iowa Republicans. Update at 8:20 p.m. ET. Cain Clarifies Further Cain released a statement Thursday saying he believed he was asked on CNN whether he, \"as president, would simply 'order' people to not seek an abortion.\" \"My answer was focused on the role of the president. The president has no constitutional authority to order any such action by anyone,\" his statement said. He said as president he would do \"everything that a president can do, consistent with his constitutional role, to advance the culture of life.\"",

Rick Perry waves to the crowd after speaking at an anti-abortion rally on the Capitol steps in Austin on Jan. 23, 2010. Texas Gov. Rick Perry likes to hold out the Lone Star State as a model \u2014 his vision for the country. But while Texas' growing economy has been a reliable jobs producer, the state's health care system is straining. Only 48 percent of Texans have private health insurance, and more than a quarter of the state's population has no insurance at all, more than any other state.  To fill this gap, the state's hospital emergency rooms and dozens of women's health clinics have stepped in to serve the uninsured across Texas. To understand the health care landscape in Texas, it helps to start with context, and perhaps nobody is better suited to explain it than Tom Banning. He is the CEO of the Texas Academy of Family Physicians, a group of about 6,000 doctors whose members reach into every part of the state. \"We've got universal health care in Texas, [but] the way we're financing it is beyond stupid,\" Banning says. When Banning says Texas has universal health care, he means if you live in urban Texas and get sick, you can go to the county hospital emergency room. \"In terms of accessing basic primary and preventive care, I think we fall far short,\" he says. Over the past eight years, citing budget constraints, Gov. Rick Perry and the Republican-controlled legislature have dropped hundreds of thousands of mostly poor and working-class Texans from the rolls of government-sponsored insurance like Medicaid and the Children's Health Insurance Program. Nearly 6.5 million Texans are now uninsured even though the majority of them have full-time jobs. Premiums in Texas' unregulated health insurance industry have soared by 105 percent over the past 10 years, according to the federal Agency for Health Care Research and Quality.  Texas employers have responded by raising employee deductibles, often dramatically, or by dropping their coverage entirely. The Effect On Women's Health Care For hundreds of thousands of Texas women and teens between the ages of 13 and 50, the 71 family planning clinics in the state serve as their gateway to health care, and for many of those women, visiting the clinics is the only time they see a nurse practitioner or a doctor. Rosalinda Roman, 19, discovered the People's Clinic in East  Austin after she got pregnant at age 16 and gave birth to a boy. Now, she comes to the clinic every three months to get her comprehensive well-woman exam and her contraceptive shot. \"I come here and I do my annual physical here. I also get birth control here [and] Depo shot,\" Roman says. \"I don't know what I would do with a second child right now.\" With the encouragement of staff at the clinic, Roman has gone back to school and is two months away from becoming a medical technician. This year, the Texas legislature and Gov. Perry cut funding for family planning clinics by two-thirds. Dr. Celia Neavel is director of adolescent health at the People's Community Clinic in East Austin and says it is a devastating blow. \"That particular funding was used obviously for birth control, but also Pap smears, breast cancer screening, for diabetes, thyroid disorders, anemia [and] high cholesterol,\" Neavel says. A 'War On Birth Control' These cuts are less about saving money and more about abortion and contraception. Evangelicals and Tea Party supporters are ascendant in Texas, and Perry is their champion. These cuts are evidence of their political power as well. The goal is to get government money out of the abortion process, and if contraceptive services have to suffer a bit of collateral damage in the process, so be it.  When The Texas Tribune asked state Rep. Wayne Christian (R-Nacogdoches), a supporter of the family planning cuts, if this was a war on birth control, he said \"yes.\" \"Well of course this is a war on birth control and abortions and everything \u2014 that's what family planning is supposed to be about,\" Christian said. Family planning clinics are routinely referred to by many Texas Republican legislators as \"abortion clinics\" even though none of the 71 family planning clinics in the state that receive government funding provides abortions. Texas and federal law prohibits that, but most women's health clinics will refer women or teens who want an abortion to a provider. \"They're sitting here, referring women out to receive abortions,\" Christian said in an interview with NPR. \"Those are the clinics, including Planned Parenthood, we were targeting.\" Perry's spokesman did not reply to requests for comment for this story, but Christian said there's no question the Texas governor is an advocate, enthusiastically signing this approach into law. \"Gov. Perry has supported the pro-life agenda consistently throughout his time in office,\" he said. The State's Family Planning Solution The budget cuts to family planning clinics won't in the end save Texas money. The state estimates nearly 300,000 women will lose access to family planning services, resulting in roughly 20,000 additional unplanned births. Texas already spends $1.3 billion on teen pregnancies \u2014  more than any other state. In San Antonio alone, unplanned children born to teens would fill 175 kindergarten classrooms each year. What's particularly galling to family planning advocates is that part of the money, $8.4 million, that was cut from family planning will now go to Crisis Pregnancy Centers around the state. Crisis Pregnancy Centers are part of the pro-life movement's answer to family planning clinics. The Downtown Pregnancy Center's office in Dallas is located inside First Baptist Church's building, historically one of the most conservative and powerful Baptist churches in North  Texas. Although it looks similar to a doctor's office, it is not a medical clinic; there are no well-woman examinations, no contraception services, free or paid, and no Pap smears. There are 165 Crisis Pregnancy Centers across Texas, and plenty won't take any state money. The Downtown Pregnancy Center doesn't. The centers are for women who are willing to keep their babies or give them up for adoption. But clinic president Caroline Cline says, heartbreakingly, only 1 to 2 percent  are willing to let their babies be adopted. Cline says teens will say to her, \"I'd rather abort than give my baby up for adoption.\" \"It's disappointing, it's very disappointing,\" she says. The Crisis Pregnancy Centers put up billboards letting frightened pregnant teens know that these are places they can turn to for help, but that can lead to a bit of a misunderstanding. The clinic gets calls from people asking what kind of abortions they offer and how much abortions cost, Cline says. Nevertheless, these young women are not turned away. \"We let them know that we don't refer for abortion or perform abortions here, but we're a great place to start,\" Cline says. The fact that millions of dollars that once went to family planning clinics will, in the future, go to Crisis Pregnancy Centers across Texas causes no small amount of bitterness among those who staff the women's health clinics. It's a feeling they're probably going to have to get used to.",

Rick Santorum and Rep. Michele Bachmann, pictured here at the New Hampshire Republican presidential debate on June 13, have signed a pledge to push through anti-abortion measures if elected president. For the first time in  memory, every Republican candidate running for president in 2012 proclaims him  or herself to be anti-abortion. But just how anti-abortion are  they? Marjorie Dannenfelser  wanted to find out. So Dannenfelser, the head of the Susan B. Anthony List \u2014 a group founded to  elect anti-abortion candidates \u2014 created \"The Pro-Life Presidential Leadership Pledge,\" and asked every  Republican presidential candidate to sign it. \"We've seen it in  other movements that take themselves seriously and we think the pro-life  movement is in a place that's taking itself seriously,\" Dannenfelser says. \"And the pledge is a very modest proposal; a very minimum bar for a  president that would consider himself pro-life.\" But now, who has \u2014  and, more importantly, who has not \u2014 signed the pledge is causing a stir in  campaign circles. Late last week,  Dannenfelser announced that most of the GOP field had signed the pledge. That  included Rep. Michele Bachmann, former House Speaker Newt  Gingrich, Rep. Ron Paul, former Minnesota Gov. Tim Pawlenty, and former  Sen. Rick Santorum. The Pledge Abstainers But two notable  candidates, former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney and former pizza executive  Herman Cain, declined. There's been quite a debate about why and how and if and whether and when those signings [of the pledge] will come. Marjorie Dannenfelser, head of the Susan B. Anthony List And since then, says  Dannenfelser, \"There's been quite a debate about why and how and if and whether  and when those signings will come.\" The pledge itself  consists of four parts. First is a promise to  nominate judges who \"are committed to restraint and applying the original  meaning of the Constitution, not legislating from the  bench.\" Second is a vow to  appoint only anti-abortion personnel to \"relevant\" administration posts. Third is a promise to  \"advance pro-life legislation\" and end taxpayer funding of abortion and de-fund  Planned Parenthood \"and all other contractors and recipients of federal funds  with affiliates that perform or fund abortions.\" Finally, candidates  must pledge that they will \"advance and sign\" legislation to protect \"unborn  children who are capable of feeling pain from  abortion.\" Cain's campaign has  said he's worried about separation of powers issues, particularly the part of  the pledge that calls for him to advance as well as sign  legislation. Romney's Own Pledge With Romney, however,  the issues are more substantive. And more problematic. That's because Romney was  for abortion rights before he was against them.

Romney is one of two presidential hopefuls who has not signed a hard-line anti-abortion pledge. A campaign spokesman confirms  his problems with the pledge are that it's written so broadly that it  could force him to cut off funding to entire hospitals or universities. It might also block  him from appointing abortion-rights backing candidates to posts that have little  or nothing to do with abortion, like the departments of State or Homeland  Security. Dannenfelser says she  takes Romney at his word that he's now pro-life, but she still doesn't buy the  campaign's excuses. \"In the end they were looking for more of a legal document  than they were a pledge,\" she says. Instead, Romney issued  his own anti-abortion pledge, minus that language he considered a  problem. Meanwhile,  abortion-rights and anti-abortion groups strongly disagree about whether having  candidates so publicly on the record about their position is a good or a bad  thing. David O'Steen,  executive director of the National Right to Life Committee, says the public is  moving more and more in an anti-abortion direction, and the candidates are  simply following that public opinion. \"Today, everyone sees  an ultrasound of their unborn baby,\" he says. \"We no longer hear the argument   that the unborn child is just a blob of tissue. We all know that what is growing  in a pregnant lady's womb is a human being and I think that's made a tremendous  difference.\" Gone Too Far? But abortion rights  backers say the Republican candidates are going way too far for mainstream  voters. \"This is a field that  is declaring publicly that each of them wants to overturn Roe vs. Wade and to  de-fund birth control programs across the country,\" says Donna Crane, policy  director for NARAL Pro-Choice America. \"These are positions that savvier  politicians won't publicly take. But this field is not shy about doing  it. Meanwhile, the flap  over the pledge is likely to continue. Newly minted candidate and former Utah  Gov. Jon Huntsman told reporters Tuesday that he likely won't sign the abortion  pledge or any other pledge, for that matter. And the one candidate  social conservatives most hope might still jump into the race, Texas Governor  Rick Perry? What they might not remember is that in 2008, Perry endorsed former New York Mayor Rudy  Guiliani, the one Republican candidate who actually supported abortion  rights.",

            "article_content": "For a brief moment during the still-early campaign for the 2012 Republican presidential nomination, the debate in New Hampshire, Mitt Romney's fellow Republicans clearly decided to go easy on him. But the truce, if you could call it that, now appears over. The kid gloves worn during last week's debate have come off. Over the weekend Rep. Michele Bachmann (R-MN) went after the GOP frontrunner for his refusal to sign the Susan B. Anthony List's anti-abortion pledge. Romney explained on NationalReview.com that while he opposes abortion, he couldn't sign the pledge because, if the policy it envisions became reality, hospitals could lose federal funding. As much as I share the goals of the Susan B. Anthony List, its well-meaning pledge is overly broad and would have unintended consequences. That is why I could not sign it. It is one thing to end federal funding for an organization like Planned Parenthood; it is entirely another to end all federal funding for thousands of hospitals across America. That is precisely what the pledge would demand and require of a president who signed it. The pledge also unduly burdens a president's ability to appoint the most qualified individuals to a broad array of key positions in the federal government. I would expect every one of my appointees to carry out my policies on abortion and every other issue, irrespective of their personal views. To this, Bachmann responded: \"It is distressing that Governor Romney refuses to sign the SBA Pledge, even while claiming to be pro-life. The excuses for not signing clearly continue the doubts about his leadership and commitment to ending the practice of abortion \u2013 particularly for a candidate who ran as pro-choice for the Senate and Governorship of Massachusetts. Any Presidential candidate seeking our party's nomination should sign the SBA Pledge and vow to protect life from conception to natural death. Governor Romney should reconsider his decision not to sign the Pledge just as he reconsidered his position on the life issue during the last campaign. Bachmann was clearly mining the rich material Romney has provided his opponents by shifting his position on a number of issues over the years in ways many opponents and voters see as politically opportunistic. Bachmann's criticism came after Tim Pawlenty, the former Minnesota governor, decided to go back on the attack against Romney over the similarities between the health care law the frontrunner signed into law in Massachusetts when he as governor and the federal health care law President Obama signed. During the debate, Pawlenty passed up the opportunity to hammer Romney as he had the day before by referring to \"Obamneycare.\" But later in the week, he was resumed the offensive against the frontrunner, saying he had erred during the debate. Meanwhile, it wasn't only those competing for the presidential nomination who  expressed doubts about Romney on some key issues. The GOP frontrunner was also criticized by fellow Republicans Sen. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, and Sen. John McCain of Arizona, for suggesting  during the debate that the Afghan government and people were engaged in a war of independence from the Taliban, the kind of war the U.S. shouldn't be involved in, he said. On NBC News' Meet the Press Sunday, Graham said: If you think the pathway to the GOP nomination in 2012 is to get to Barack Obama's left on Libya, Afghanistan and Iraq, you're going to meet a lot of headwinds.  This is not a war of Afghan independence from my point of view.  This is the center of gravity against the war on terror, radical Islam.  It is in our national security interest to make sure the Taliban never come back.  If we fail in Afghanistan, they will kill every moderate who tried to help us, and no one in the future will, will step up. It will destabilize Pakistan beyond what exists today.  It will be a colossal national security mistake. This is more the normal situation for a frontrunner than the debate, which was something of an anomaly. Frontrunners at this stage of a presidential race usually face tough attacks from competitors for their party's nomination. They also get criticized by other in their party when they seem to stray from the party's  positions. It can all work out to the frontrunner's benefit if gets the nomination by making him a better campaigner for the general election. Of course, it can leave a frontrunner pretty damaged, too.",

Mitch Daniels going to run for president or not? That lingering question which has occupied the minds of political observers for weeks now will only be asked with more intensity now that he's let it be known that he intends to sign a bill banning Planned Parenthood from receiving state taxpayer funds. Daniels' decision would make Indiana the first state to enact such a ban. Planned Parenthood's receipt of taxpayer funds has angered conservatives because, along with the preventive health-care services it provides to women, it also provides abortions. What makes Daniels' decision particularly ironic is that he recently urged Republicans to set aside divisive social issues to focus on economic ones, particularly the creation of jobs which polls of voters indicate has been their top concern. As NPR's Julie Rovner put it in a report for the network's newscast: Daniels... had called for a \"truce\" on social issues until the nation's economic crisis is  settled. But  he's apparently making an exception for the bill that would stop the state from  funding \u2014 or passing along funding it gets from Washington \u2014 to Planned Parenthood or any  other organization that performs abortions or operates a facility where  abortions are performed. Abortions have never been permitted using federal  family planning funds. The Indiana legislation is reminiscent of an unsuccessful effort by congressional Republicans to ban Planned Parenthood from receiving any federal tax dollars even though most of the medical care it provides women, more than 90 percent, has nothing to do with abortion services. An Indianapolis Star report provides some information from a statement the governor issued: In a statement, Daniels said he had supported the bill from the outset \"and the recent addition of language guarding against the spending of tax dollars to support abortions creates no reason to alter my position.\" He said this view was supported by an \"overwhelming majority\" of Hoosiers, and that it will not impede women's ability to get health care, as Planned Parenthood has asserted. \"I commissioned a careful review of access to services across the state and can confirm that all non-abortion services, whether family planning or basic women's health, will remain readily available in every one of our 92 counties. In addition, I have ordered the Family and Social Services Administration to see that Medicaid recipients receive prompt notice of nearby care options. We will take any actions necessary to ensure that vital medical care is, if anything, more widely available than before,\" Daniels said. Betty Cockrum, president of Planned Parenthood of Indiana, wasn't as optimistic as Daniels: \"The signing of HB 1210 into law is unconscionable and unspeakable.  We will now  suffer the consequences of lawmakers who have no regard for fact-based decision  making and sound public health policy. \"As  many as 22,000 low-income Hoosiers will lose their medical home.  Countless  patients will find themselves without access to lifesaving tests to avoid the  tragic outcomes of cervical and breast cancer and epidemic sexually transmitted  disease here in Indiana. \"What are the consequences of taking  away federal funding that passes through the state to PPIN?  The U.S. Centers  for Disease Control and Prevention tells us that the legalization of birth  control was one of the 10 most meaningful advances in public health policy in  the last century.  And yet our legislative leadership has unplugged those most  in need from that essential service.  They are creating a lose-lose for  Hoosiers.  Decreased birth control means more unintended pregnancy.  More  unintended pregnancy means increased Medicaid spending.  Indiana already has one  of the highest rates of Medicaid-covered births.  The cost is already 450  million dollars.  Logic would suggest that those births will lead to  Medicaid-covered dependents for perhaps 18 years.  The lawmakers have outdone  themselves in contributing further to the cycle of poverty here in Indiana, where 22 percent  of our children live below the poverty line. \"We  will be filing an injunction immediately to try to halt this alarming erosion of  public health policy in our state.\" If Daniels decides to run for the Republican nomination, his decision could be viewed as fitting the traditional pattern of White House hopefuls in which Republicans run to the right and Democrats to the left to secure their party's nomination, then towards the political center in the general election. Daniels' decision, for instance, should lift his stock with the social conservatives who comprise many of his party's activists who can help a candidate win the early primaries. It could make his job harder in a general election campaign, however.",

In a Morning Edition interview by host Steve Inskeep of Rep. Tim Scott, a freshman South Carolina Republican, the congressman used an interesting rhetorical tactic, one he is certainly not alone in using; he redefined abortion from being a social issue to a spending issue. In a discussion about the spending agreement to fund the federal government for the remainder of the year, Steve asked Scott, who voted against the continuing resolution that avoided a government shutdown, why the big fight over taxpayer funding of Planned Parenthood which, by federal law, can't use federal money to provide abortions in any event? Scott's response was that the Planned Parenthood standoff really was about spending. STEVE: Do you think it is appropriate for social issues or other kinds of issues to be involved in this larger debate over the budget and the economy? SCOTT: It they're spending $300 plus million of taxpayer dollars, if it is a spending issue, all spending should be on the table. We're talking about military, we're talking about family and Planned Parenthood, we're talking about every other issue that comes to the table. If we can talk about police officers and fireman, why in the world would we not be able to talk about Planned Parenthood? Steve invoked Indiana's Republican Gov. Mitch Daniel who has called for a \"truce\" on some social issues so Republicans could stay focused on fiscal issues. Scott's response was that it was great that Republicans could disagree but he maintained that Planned Parenthood was a spending issue. One reason for framing the issue this way is obvious. If abortion is a spending issue then it's not While Scott seemed reluctant to go where Steve wanted to take him, other Republicans have been more willing to go there. For instance, Rep. Chris Smith (R-NJ), the anti-abortion congressman and leader in the House GOP for eliminating all funding to Planned Parenthood, told the Trentonian that he saw it his effort to zero out funding for the non-profit that provides women's health care, as a twofer. An excerpt from a March 7, 2011 Trentonian story: The conventional wisdom is that Republicans are forced to support either a budget that restricts abortions or a budget that cuts spending in areas unrelated to abortion. Of course, the Republicans' \"Pledge for America\" says the new majority will do both. But negotiations over the federal budget threaten to force the GOP, including its 87 House freshmen, to choose between them. Smith counters the conventional wisdom by saying that blocking funding for Planned Parenthood is an effective cut on federal spending, which means he can have his cake and eat it. \"There's no reason to be divided. These are twin objectives,\" Smith said, predicting many Republican freshmen opposed to abortion will vote with him. The story goes on to cite a Republican freshman congressman from Arizona, Rep. David Scheikert who appeared to differ with Scott and Smith that abortion was a spending issue. Freshman Rep. David Schweikert, R-Ariz., isn't one of them. He opposes abortion. But he said he'd vote for a budget that lacks new restrictions on the procedure because current law already bans federal dollars from being used for most abortions. Banning taxpayer dollars from going to Planned Parenthood, he said, should be a battle for another day if it comes to a choice. \"If we're staying with that current policy, I think we'd still be safe,\" Schweikert said. \"Because for me, it's substantially about the fiscal position\" he took in last year's elections when it came to reining in the federal deficit. That's an interesting division among anti-abortion House members. Some are willing to redefine their abortion as a spending fight. And some clearly aren't.",

A lot of people were surprised when House Republicans' desire to eliminate federal funding for Planned Parenthood very nearly caused the shutdown of the federal government last week. But those who have watched the abortion debate over a long period of time were not surprised. Despite the successes members of the anti-abortion movement have had over the years in restricting the procedure, \"Planned Parenthood remains the thorn in their side,\" says Deana Rohlinger, associate professor of sociology at Florida State University. Rep. Mike Pence (R-IN)  introduced legislation to defund Planned Parenthood in January.\n                \n                    \n                    Alex Brandon/AP\n                    \n                \nhide caption Rep. Mike Pence (R-IN)  introduced legislation to defund Planned Parenthood in January. Planned Parenthood is the nation's largest single provider of abortions, yet it gets millions of dollars in federal funding with which to provide other services. Efforts to change that have been unsuccessful not only with this last go-round, but also stretching back nearly three decades. That makes abortion opponents see red. \"I would assume that most Americans would be surprised, if not shocked, to learn that the largest abortion provider in America is also the largest recipient of federal funding under Title X,\" Rep. Mike Pence (R-IN) said in January when he introduced legislation to strip Planned Parenthood of its federal funding. Title X is the federal family planning program. While the use of federal funds for abortion has been banned since the 1970s, and for the entire history of the family planning program, that is only a technicality to Pence and his anti-abortion allies. \"There's no question that money that Planned Parenthood receives for its operational expenses from the federal government frees up resources that can be used to provide and promote abortions through its abortion clinics,\" he said on the House floor during a similarly unsuccessful attempt to defund the organization in 2009. Legal Battles In fact, efforts to separate Planned Parenthood from its federal funding date back to the 1980s. One of the earliest efforts came in 1982, near the start of the Reagan administration. A regulation quickly dubbed the \"squeal rule\" would have required family planning providers to notify a minor's parents if she obtained prescription contraceptives from a Title X clinic. The rule was overturned in federal court after Planned Parenthood and others sued, charging it violated patient confidentiality. [Planned Parenthood] basically stands in the way of its primary goal, which is to make the abortion procedure inaccessible in the U.S. Deana Rohlinger, sociology professor In 1987, the Reagan administration issued what came to be known as the \"gag rule.\" It overturned longstanding family planning regulations that required that women with unintended pregnancies be advised of all of their legal options: keeping the baby, adoption or abortion. The new rules said federally funded family planning clinics could no longer provide abortion counseling. This time, Planned Parenthood lost. In 1991, in Rust v. Sullivan, a divided Supreme Court ruled 5-4 that the government could bar abortion counseling. But continued legal wrangling kept the rules from being implemented until after President Bill Clinton took office, and he rescinded them. They have never been re-imposed. And so Planned Parenthood remains a major grantee of the family planning program, much to the consternation of people like Marjorie Dannenfelser, president of the Susan B. Anthony List. The organization works to elect anti-abortion female candidates and has been running one of several anti-Planned Parenthood efforts. \"It is the biggest abortion franchise in the nation. One in 10 of its clients receive abortions,\" Dannenfelser said on NPR's Talk of the Nation last month. \"A quarter of abortions occurring in this nation are performed by Planned Parenthood clinics.\" Both statistics are true. But Planned Parenthood also does a lot more, points out Cecile Richards, Planned Parenthood's president. \"Last year we provided nearly 1 million pap smears, 830,000 breast exams, nearly 4 million tests and treatments for [sexually transmitted diseases], including HIV,\" she said. In fact, Richards notes, 1 in 5 women in the United States has visited a Planned Parenthood clinic. For many women, going to Planned Parenthood is about more than just getting birth control. \"For more than half our patients, Planned Parenthood is the only nurse or doctor they will see all year,\" she says. Both Sides Invigorated All of that makes the organization highly popular \u2014 and makes anti-abortion activists that much more irritated that Planned Parenthood continues to get federal funding: about $360 million in 2009, the last year for which statistics are available. Florida State professor Rohlinger says what the anti-abortion movement hates most about Planned Parenthood is its persistence: \"It basically stands in the way of its primary goal, which is to make the abortion procedure inaccessible in the U.S.\" Indeed, over the years, the anti-abortion movement has had a lot of success in cutting back on abortions by putting various limitations on abortion clinics \u2014 things like requiring certain types of equipment or special paperwork. But those limitations pretty much haven't worked on Planned Parenthood, which still has 84 affiliates with 800 clinics in every state except North Dakota. \"Planned Parenthood has been pretty resistant to this and has by and large refused to quit offering the procedure despite these different hurdles,\" Rohlinger says. Anti-abortion lawmakers have also found Planned Parenthood to be a common enemy they can point to to rally their base. But that hasn't always been easy, either. \"They've really tried to challenge the notion that Planned Parenthood is a family planning organization,\" Rohlinger says, \"and have tried to associate them solely with the abortion issue. And it hasn't been very successful.\" Just last Friday, for example, Republican Sen. John Kyl of Arizona said on the Senate floor that \"if you want an abortion, you go to Planned Parenthood. And that's well over 90 percent of what Planned Parenthood does.\" In fact, just the opposite is true; well over 90 percent of what Planned Parenthood does is NOT abortion. Kyl's office later said his speech \"wasn't intended to be a factual statement,\" which, among other things, got him ridiculed by both Jon Stewart and Stephen Colbert. The bottom line, however, is that making Planned Parenthood a target is probably good for those on both sides of the abortion debate. Politico reports that online contributions to Planned Parenthood have grown by 500 percent since the House passed the bill that would have stripped its federal funding. Meanwhile, says Rohlinger, Republicans can use attempts to defund the group \"to regain the confidence of its conservative base, particularly among the social conservatives.\" As elections approach, many anti-abortion activists have been complaining that Republicans have not gone far enough to try to end the practice. \"So Planned Parenthood is a really convenient and good rallying point,\" she says. And that is why the fight is unlikely to end anytime soon.",

The House of Representatives has passed an amendment that would cut federal funding to the organization. Last month, the House of Representatives approved an amendment that would eliminate all federal funds for the Planned Parenthood Federation of America. Its sponsor, Indiana Republican Mike Pence, called the vote \"a victory for taxpayers and a victory for life.\" The fate of the measure is unclear \u2014 it faces an uncertain future in the Senate. But the effort to cut funds to Planned Parenthood is not new, NPR's health policy correspondent Julie Rovner tells Talk of the Nation's Neal Conan. It \"goes back at least 25 years. This is the beginning of my 26th year covering Congress, and one of the first stories I wrote\" was about efforts to defund Planned Parenthood. Julie Rovner, health policy correspondent, NPRMarjorie Dannenfesler, president, Susan B. Anthony ListSarah Stoesz, president and CEO, Planned Parenthood Minnesota, North Dakota, South Dakota The difference between those previous attempts and the current effort, Rovner says, is that \"this is now coming at a time when there is also the effort to really cut the federal budget. So I think there's a confluence of events.\" Planned Parenthood receives approximately $300 million from the federal government, Rovner says, an amount that includes not only funds for the Title X family planning program but also Medicaid funds and support for the Maternal and Child Health block grant program. Federal funds cannot be used to provide abortion services, notes Rovner. Opponents of Planned Parenthood argue that tax dollars should not subsidize an agency that provides abortions, even if the provision of those services is separated. Marjorie Dannenfelser, president of the anti-abortion-rights group Susan B. Anthony List, says federal funds for Planned Parenthood require even greater scrutiny in the current fiscal climate. \"We are at a very acute economic crisis where there are no sacred cows,\" she tells Conan. Planned Parenthood's defenders, however, point out that there's already a law that prevents the use of any federal funds to pay for abortion \u2014 and that taxpayer funds are used to support a wide swath of health care services to men and women. Sarah Stoesz, president and CEO of Planned Parenthood of Minnesota, North Dakota and South   Dakota, says the vast majority of Planned Parenthood's patients \"are there for basic reproductive health services, family planning, cancer screening and so forth. \"We offer a full range of options for women,\" Stoesz says. \"We're there to support women, to offer them the health services and information that they need, and then to allow them to make the best choice for them.\"",

Planned Parenthood failed to stop House Republicans from voting to end the organization's federal funding in what many critics of the GOP contended was more an attack on abortion rights than an effective way of cutting federal deficits. But the organization isn't giving up on the House. It plans to run radio ads that will initially target several Republican lawmakers who voted for an anti-Planned Parenthood amendment to a stopgap spending bill that passed Friday in a 245-180 vote. Planned Parenthood identified the Republican House members as freshmen Allen West (FL), Frank Guinta (NH), Ann Marie Buerkle (NY) and Pat Meehan (PA) as well as Mike Fitzpatrick, (PA) who served in the House previously. House Democrats and other defenders of abortion rights have criticized the Republican efforts against Planned Parenthood as being at odds with GOP campaign promises in the lead-up to the midterm-elections to focus on job creation. During the campaign, Republicans faulted Democrats for spending too much time on passing the controversial health care law instead of job growth. The Planned Parenthood ads touch on that argument. They also emphasize that the non-profit group's centers provide millions of women annually with low-cost preventive health care services, including breast and cervical cancer screenings. The women's health organization provided the text of the ads. Here's the text of one called \"Flushed.\" Hear that? It's the sound of (Congressman/woman First name Last  name) wasting your money. S/he just voted against one of the best  investments ever: making sure that women and families can get affordable  birth control and preventive health care. X's vote doesn't create a  single job, doesn't reduce the deficit, and doesn't save you a  penny. What his/her vote WOULD do is bar Planned Parenthood from  receiving federal funding to do its vital work - by denying millions of women  preventive care, including birth control, annual exams, and lifesaving cancer  screenings. And (name) vote is sure to increase the number of unintended  pregnancies and undetected cancers. In the long run, that's going to  cost all of us plenty.  Representative X promised to focus on  jobs, but instead s/he's joined a costly war on women's health  care. We need your help to fight back.  Find out more at www.plannedparenthood.org. Kaiser Health News has a very helpful guide laying out the issues behind the Republican effort in the House to defund Planned Parenthood as well as what the underlying law does and doesn't allow when it comes to the provision of abortion services at the organization's health centers.",

Tens of thousands are expected on the streets of Moscow tomorrow. As The Guardian reports, 50,000 have said they will show up on \"Moscow's Sakharov Prospect, named after the late leading Soviet dissident Andrei Sakharov,\" and thousands more will march across the country. As we've reported, the protests stem from disputed parliamentary elections and come months before a crucial presidential election that will test Prime Minister Vladimir Putin's 12-year hold on power. Reuters reports on the mood on the ground: \"Bringing together liberals, nationalists, anarchists, environmentalists and urban youth, protest organizers have settled on a list of 19 speakers that includes former Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev, anti-corruption blogger Alexei Navalny, rock singer Yuri Shevchuk and writer Boris Akunin. \"An online vote was held on what slogans to put on 2,000 balloons at the rally. 'You don't represent us!' was the most popular, followed by 'You swindled us!\" and \"We will not stop!' Reuters spoke to Navalny, who was arrested and sentenced to 15 days in jail at an earlier, unsanctioned protest. \"I am absolutely sure that up to 1 million people are ready to take part in such rallies ... I see the people's mood,\" Navalny, told Reuters. \"They stole about 1 million votes. And that's only in Moscow. I think that these people are completely dissatisfied with what happened and are ready to defend their rights, including going out on to the streets.\" The Financial Times reports that over the past few days the Kremlin has turned on its charm in an effort to curb the protests. President Dmitry Medvedev promised \"far-reaching political reforms\" in a speech, yesterday. But the Times reports that the opposition is not buying it. \"We have seen a lot of promises before and they haven't been met,\" Navalny told the Times in response to Medvedev's speech. \"Instead they have been aimed at keeping the swindlers and thieves in power.\" The Guardian frames the issue a bit differently. It reports that the Kremlin has alternately made overtures and dismissed the protesters: \"Putin has twice compared the protesters' ribbons to condoms and repeatedly accused them of being in the pay of the US state department, whileDmitry Medvedev, the more liberal president, has issued a series of proposals to loosen the election laws. ... \"In a sign of increasing nervousness, Vladislav Surkov, the Kremlin's secretive chief ideologist, gave a rare interview published on Friday, in which he argued that \"the system has already changed\". \"'People are saying: \"We exist, we have meaning, we are the people,\"' Surkov told Izvestiya newspaper. 'One cannot arrogantly dismiss their opinions.' Surkov is the architect of Russia's 'managed democracy' and 'power vertical', two terms used to describe the country's soft authoritarian form of governance.\"",

With widespread fraud alleged in recent parliamentary voting, Putin faced much more critical questioning than usual. For the first time in more than a decade running Russia, Prime Minister Vladimir Putin is facing serious opposition to his rule. And that meant he faced tougher than usual questions Thursday at his annual question-and-answer session that lasted more than four hours on Russian television. \"Do you think the elections are honest and their results are fair?\" the TV moderator asked him, reading an emailed question. \"The election results absolutely reflect the balance of power in the country,\" Putin said. The election results absolutely reflect the balance of power in the country. Russian President Vladimir Putin dismissing allegations of election fraud The results from the Dec. 4 elections gave Pruin's ruling United Russia party a slim majority, well down from its showing four years ago. Many critics also say the vote was tainted by fraud. And videos that appear to show ballot box stuffing have gone viral on the internet. This helped drive more than 50,000 protesters on to the streets of Moscow on Saturday. Putin said that he was pleased if, as a result of \"the Putin regime,\" young people were standing up for their beliefs. But he also made fun of the white ribbons some wore, comparing them to condoms at an anti-AIDS rally. And he suggested some students were paid to protest. \"I don't think that he's happy to see us there, I am absolutely sure that he's not happy to see us there. And I'm absolutely sure that not one student was paid for going to this protest action,\" said Marina Ivanova, who was one of the protesters demanding that the elections be re-run. Putin made it clear that isn't going to happen. \"I think that he sounded completely inadequate and I think next time there will be lots of people [protesting],\" she said. More Demonstrations Set New protests are already planned. For now, Ivanova says she and her young friends are joking on Facebook about some odd words Putin used today \u2014 tough sounding slang and an obscure Kipling reference. During the four and a half hour session, four of the top 10 hashtags trending on Twitter were Russian. Among them \u2014 botox. The Internet has been buzzing with speculation that Putin's appearance has changed in recent months. Masha Lipman of the Carnegie Center in Moscow says Putin seemed tired. She says he's in a genuine political crisis, and the crucial moment will be the presidential election in March. Putin is considered the overwhelming favorite. \"Putin may send a message that he's confident and he's the master of the situation, but it's also true that his rating is on the decline and because of rigging in the parliamentary election, people expect rigging in the presidential election as well,\" Lipman said. Putin proposed putting web cams in all 90,000 polling stations. He also there could be changes to the way governors are selected. At present, the president appoints them. He also held out the possibility of bringing more parties into the political arena. But Lipman says the lack of trust means nothing he said today would have changed the opinion of people who have taken to the streets in protest. She says what he did say suggests that given the choice between cracking down or opening up the political system, he has chosen the softer option for now.",

Reuters reports that Putin also offered some back-handed compliments to protesters. \"I saw on people on the TV screens ... mostly young people, active and with positions that they expressed clearly,\" Putin said according to Reuters. \"This makes me happy, and if that is the result of the Putin regime, that's good \u2014 there's nothing bad about it.\" \"They will at least make some money,\" he added. Putin went on to say that when he saw the massive protest this past Saturday, he was confused by the white ribbons worn by protesters. The Moscow Times reports he said he thought they were wearing anti-AIDS ribbons and that it looked like demonstrators had put on \"some condoms.\" Putin's comments are likely to fuel further protests. The demonstrations are seen as a serious challenge to his rule and the largest of their kind since the fall of the Soviet Union. Putin is in a tough position: Despite accusations of fraud, his party suffered major losses during this month's election. The discontent might extend to his presidential bid early next year.

In defending Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius' decision to countermand for now the Food and Drug Administration's approval of the Plan B morning-after pill for over-the-counter sale to minors, President Obama gave an explanation that left many critics unsatisfied. At a Thursday news conference, Obama said: \"I will say this, as the father of  two  daughters.  I think it is important for us to make sure that we apply  some  common sense to various rules when it comes to over-the-counter  medicine.  And  as I understand it, the reason Kathleen made this  decision was she could not be  confident that a 10-year-old or an  11-year-old go into a drugstore, should be  able \u2014 alongside bubble gum  or batteries \u2014 be able to buy a medication that  potentially, if not  used properly, could end up having an adverse effect.  And I  think most  parents would probably feel the same way.\" Leave aside the disturbing image of retailers selling the emergency contraceptive next to batteries and gum. Also, let's not dig too far into the fallacy that adults can ever have confidence that 10- or 11-year olds will ever use products exactly how their manufacturers meant. That even includes the aforementioned batteries and gum. Indeed, it's a test not even many adults can meet. Also, let's not consider that even medications when used properly can have unforeseen effects in certain people. One patently obvious problem with the president's explanation is that if you follow his logic, it appears he is saying that if Sebelius had been persuaded 10-year olds could properly follow instructions, the administration would have been OK with the OTC sales to pre-adolescents. Really? And how could that outcome not bother the father of two daughters who happens to be president? This helps explain why the president left his critics on Plan B, including some liberals, suspecting the decision was more about the nation being within a year of a general election in which the president faces what at this point appears to be a tough battle for re-election. If the administration had approved the OTC sale of the emergency contraceptive to minors, that would have obviously left Obama vulnerable to Republican charges that he was encouraging young teens to have sex or abortions since one way the drug works is by preventing a fertilized egg from implanting. Such arguments could certainly help move some voters away from the president in battleground states like Pennsylvania, Ohio, Florida, Wisconsin, Colorado and Virginia. It could have hurt him further with Catholic voters, many of whom are Latino. So you don't have to work very hard to come up with a political motivation for the decision which, of course, the administration denies. But there was at least one stronger argument than the one Obama made for his administration's decision that deals with notion of 10-year olds purchasing the morning after pill. It comes from Michael Tomasky, writing in The Daily Beast. Tomasky argues persuasively that there were legitimate reasons parents might not want their minor children having easy access to the morning-after pill. An excerpt: \"But it seems to me that there is a fair issue here, and it has to do with parents having a right to know about and be involved in what their kids are up to. You simply don't have to be a right-winger to have concerns about your 14- or 15-year-old daughter having easy access to such a pill... ... In an ideal world, parents would rationally support the idea of their daughters having every means available to them to correct an error (or, obviously, to override a violation) that happened a day or two prior. But parents don't always think rationally about these things. That makes these issues sensitive by definition, and it's hardly illegitimate for a government to take such matters into consideration. I'd have had more respect for Kathleen Sibelius in this situation if, instead of that blather about 11-year-old girls not being able to follow instructions and take the pill properly, she'd just said: \"Look, I respect the science, but this raises ethical and moral questions about what is the proper age for access to emergency contraception, in addition to the scientific ones. And that's a public debate we ought to have more of before we pull this trigger.\" That really does seem like the killer argument. Who could be against that kind of debate?",

Bryant supported a controversial amendment to the state's constitution on \"personhood.\" Voters in Mississippi were expected to make it the first state to confer protected legal status to fertilized human eggs Tuesday. Instead, they made it the second state to reject a so-called personhood amendment to its constitution. One possible reason is that the effort divides even those who consider themselves against abortion. For example, the state's Republican lieutenant governor \u2014 now governor-elect \u2014 Phil Bryant, campaigned hard for the measure. \"We're saying this child, once conceived, will have an opportunity to have the same rights as you and I,\" he said in one television ad. But at the same time, Haley Barbour, the even more popular outgoing Republican governor, was doing television interviews expressing doubts about the measure. \"I believe life begins at conception,\" he told MSNBC. \"Unfortunately this personhood amendment doesn't say that. It says that life begins at fertilization, cloning, or the functional equivalent thereof. That ambiguity is striking a lot of pro-life people here as concerning.\" Barbour later said he voted for the amendment. But it seems that many other anti-abortion voters didn't. With nearly all the votes in, it failed by a hefty 16-percentage-point margin. Freda Bush, a Jackson, Miss., OB-GYN who unsuccessfully helped push the amendment, said she thought the measure's opponents prevailed by confusing voters. \"The what-ifs, possibilities, it raised just enough doubt in the people's minds that even pro-life people who know it's a baby were thinking differently,\" she told a reporter from Mississippi Public Broadcasting. Those what-ifs include requiring women with life-threatening illnesses to continue their pregnancies, since the amendment would have allowed no exceptions to what would be an absolute ban on abortion. Other possibilities included bans on certain forms of birth control that can prevent the implantation of a fertilized egg, like the IUD and some formulations of the pill. But it's not just voters in Mississippi who have serious doubts about the strategy of giving legal status to fertilized human eggs. \"The 'personhood' amendment is a gimmick that wastes money and harms pro-life candidates,\" wrote Phyllis Schlafly, president of the Eagle Forum, a prominent anti-abortion group. Schlafly says the problem is that such a proposal tends to inflame opponents, who then turn out to vote and take down other candidates as well. \"A losing ballot initiative hurts candidates on its side because, when voters vote against the initiative, they typically vote against the candidates linked to it by the liberal media,\" Schlafly wrote. Other anti-abortion activists cite other problems with the personhood strategy. \"It's not only a waste of time, but potentially very dangerous,\" said James Bopp Jr., general counsel for the National Right to Life Committee, one of the nation's oldest and largest anti-abortion groups. Bopp says that while he agrees with the goal of declaring fertilized eggs people, that can only be accomplished after the Supreme Court strikes down Roe v. Wade, the ruling that currently makes most abortions legal nationwide. If a personhood amendment like the one in Mississippi were to pass and reach the Supreme Court now, he said, \"courts will readily strike it down, but furthermore it's dangerous because the [Supreme] Court has also indicated an interest in reformulating the right to abortion to make it even more extreme.\" Bopp said he could see a situation in which five justices could end up reaffirming Roe in an even broader way, which \"would mean that all current restrictions on abortion such as limiting funding or informed consent ... or parental notice \u2014 would be unconstitutional. So that would be a real major setback for the pro-life movement.\" But fellow anti-abortion lawyer Matt Staver doubts that would happen. Staver says the Supreme Court's swing abortion vote, Justice Anthony Kennedy, has gone both ways on the issue in recent years. \"So I can't really predict which way he's going to go at the end of the day, and I can't predict who's going to be on the court when this gets there, but what I can say is that this is, in my view, the right strategy,\" Staver says. Meanwhile, backers of the Mississippi amendment say they'll press forward, trying again in that state and others as well. \"We're not going to be defined by one election,\" said Jennifer Mason, communications director for the group Personhood USA. \"As long as human beings are being treated as property, we will continue to ensure that they get personhood rights, that those rights are recognized, just as the rest of us enjoy.\" The group is working to get similar amendments on the ballot in as many as a dozen other states in 2012.",

            "article_content": " Supporters of a constitutional amendment that says human life begins at the moment of fertilization gather at a prayer rally in Jackson, Miss., in June. Residents will vote on the amendment Nov. 8. Next week Mississippi voters will decide whether to pass a constitutional amendment that redefines a person. Under the proposal, fertilized human eggs would be considered human beings, which would ban all abortions in the state. But abortion-rights activists say it would also limit contraception and threaten fertility treatments. Les Riley has worked on the initiative for years, gathering signatures to get it on the ballot. Now, in northwest Mississippi, he's talking to voters and assembling yard signs that urge the passage of Amendment 26.  Les Riley has worked for years to get the personhood amendment on the ballot. \"We started out with no money [and] four families in my living room and we ended up with over 2,000 volunteers spread all the way across Mississippi,\" Riley says. Part of Riley's strategy is going door to door in small towns like Senatobia. He talks to one woman, telling her there will be a pro-life amendment on the ballot this November. \"It's statewide to help stop abortion in our state ... and I'd sure appreciate your support,\" he says. \"You can count on it,\" she responds. \"I do not like abortion.\" Both candidates for governor in this conservative state are behind the amendment, and the Democratic attorney general running for re-election says he would enforce it. Many groups that traditionally oppose abortion are supporting the amendment, including the American Family Association. \"When the law looks at a woman carrying a child, only the woman has legal rights and the baby doesn't have any rights,\" says Patrick Vaughn, the AFA's general counsel. \"What this would do is say you're looking at two persons. The woman is a person; the baby is also a person.\" The measure would ban abortion with no exceptions for rape or incest, but those who oppose it say it's about much more. They contend the language is so broad and vague it could ban some forms of birth control like IUDs and the morning-after pill. They also say it could affect how doctors treat ectopic pregnancies and throw into question fertility procedures. Atlee Breland formed her own group: Parents Against MS 26. Breland lives in the Jackson suburbs and has a 3-year-old son, Andrew, and had twin girls Katherine and Claire with the help of fertility treatments. \"There's a whole lot of question about what would and wouldn't be allowed, and one of the frightening things to me is that nobody seems to really know for sure,\" she says. Breland says even many opposed to abortion think this amendment goes too far. She says it opens the door for too much government intrusion into health care.  Atlee Breland of Parents Against MS 26 says she had never been an activist until she began working on the campaign to defeat Mississippi's personhood amendment. \"Legislatures and judges are good at a lot of things, but when I want to decide what I'm going to do to build my family, I'm going to go to my doctor and ask him for help,\" she says. \"My doctor and my husband and I are going to decide what's the right thing to do to have our children.\" The Mississippi State Medical Association won't support the measure, and others directly oppose it, including Doctors Against MS 26. Infertility specialist Randall Hines says theoretically doctors could be charged with murder if an embryo or fetus dies. \"The question would be ... [if] anybody [is] actually going to prosecute you for murder,\" Hines says. \"I would hope not but I think to leave it to a local prosecutor to decide who he's going to prosecute and which issue he's going to prosecute on doesn't make any sense.\" If passed, the amendment goes into effect 30 days after the election is certified. But it's unclear exactly what that would mean. \"That's precisely the sort of ambiguity that you don't want,\" says Alexa Kolbi-Molinas with the American Civil Liberties Union, which opposes the amendment. \"You don't want doctors practicing in a sort of unsure environment waiting for a lawsuit or waiting for the legislature to try to figure out what they can and cannot do.\" It's not safe for the doctors and it's not safe for women's health, she says. But proponents of Amendment 26 say the state Legislature would have to work out the details of what is banned. They're running an ad that says, \"Don't let Planned Parenthood and the ACLU distract you from what's at stake. On Election Day we can vote what we all know: We are persons at the beginning of life.\" A similar measure was on the ballot in Colorado twice but failed both times. At a recent high school football game in rural Mississippi, Angela Krimm, a teacher who opposes abortion, says she's not sure about Amendment 26. \"I don't know what the truth is but I do know that people are fired up about this,\" she says. \"There's a lot of heated arguments, because some people say this and some people say that, and I think it's right now just conjecture.\" Whatever voters in Mississippi decide, advocates for personhood nationwide say they're trying to get the issue on the ballot in more than a dozen states. Groups are gathering signatures in Florida, Montana and Oregon.",

Republican presidential hopeful and former Massachusetts governor Mitt Romney addresses the Family Research Council's Values Voter Summit in Washington on Oct. 8, 2011. Read Another Opinion On Mitt Romney Ben Adler is a contributing writer for The Nation. Mitt Romney came to the Values Voter Summit in Washington, DC, on Saturday morning hoping to mollify his critics on the religious right. He tried his best, offering more specifics on the ways he would attack abortion rights and gay rights than his opponents had. And yet the conference organizers seemed to have it in for him. They scheduled Bryan Fischer, the extremist firebrand radio host and spokesman for the American Family Association, to speak immediately after Romney. Fischer delivered the first real fire and brimstone of the weekend and his speech was essentially a plea for the 3,000 social conservative activists in attendance to vote against Romney. The theme of his address was what a president needs to be, and the answer was, in essence, an ardent Christian fundamentalist, not a Mormon or a moderate. I profiled Fischer for Newsweek back in January, and he had harsh words for Romney when I bumped into him on Friday. Fischer told me he doesn't trust Romney on social issues. \"Romney was pro-abortion as recently as 2005,\" Fischer noted. \"It seems like he switched to being prolife for political convenience.\" Fischer also blames Romney for the fact that Massachusetts became the first state to recognize gay marriages because it happened on Romney's watch. It was required by a state Supreme Court ruling, but Fischer thinks Romney could have waited for the state legislature to act instead of ordering state officials to grant marriage licenses to gay couples in contravention of what remained state law on the books. \"We have gay marriage in the United States because of Mitt Romney,\" Fischer said. \"It was executive activism.\" So I asked Fischer what would happen if Romney, who currently leads in the polls and fundraising, wins the nomination. \"Romney would be John McCain,\" Fischer replied. \"Social conservatives would be unenthusiastic and that would affect turnout and make it harder to defeat Obama.\" If that's true, Romney had a quite a challenge in front of him today. (Fischer also told me that last year he saw Romney address this gathering and \"he didn't move the crowd an inch.\") The conference, hosted by the Family Research Council, has featured speeches from every major Republican presidential candidate. Many focused on economic and foreign policy, dealing with social issues only in passing. That's normally Romney's approach as well. He has complained in interviews that he was forced to spend too much time discussing culture-war issues in the last election. At one debate this summer, when asked about \"don't ask, don't tell\" reinstatement, he responded with the cowardly diversion, \"We should be talking about the economy.\" Romney admitted that he does, in fact, oppose letting gays serve openly in the armed forces. But with his eye on New Hampshire's social moderates and the general election, he generally focuses his pitch heavily on economics. Romney was introduced by conservative legal activist Jay Sekulow, who is supporting him. While Sekulow hit the standard notes about supporting Israel and balancing the budget, he emphasized the fact that the next president could appoint Supreme Court justices who prove decisive in cases on divisive social issues. He mentioned partial birth abortion, but gave even more attention to the mention of God in the Pledge of Allegiance, a comically stupid obsession that has come up repeatedly at this conference. As usual, Romney opened today with his typical talking points. Unemployment is too high, Obama squandered our triple-A bond rating, the stimulus cost too much money and a businessman like Romney is the one to turn the economy and budget deficit around. \"I think to create jobs it helps to have had a job,\" Romney quipped, to gales of audience laughter. Apparently conservatives think Obama's experience teaching constitutional law at the University of Chicago was not a job, despite their professed commitment to the Constitution and their adoration for Chicago professors like Milton Friedman. Romney offered his most irritating trademark line that \"I will never, ever, apologize for America.\" The myth that President Obama \"apologized for America\" has become such a widespread notion on the right that Romney need not even bother asserting that Obama did so. He added, for good measure, \"If you do not want America to be the strongest nation on Earth, I'm not your president. You have that president today.\" That was Romney's third laugh line, which makes him the second-funniest speaker of the weekend, after Herman Cain. You might say that's damning him with faint praise, but the \"values voters\" aren't known for their cutting-edge sense of humor. Romney pivoted to social issues and gave them more attention than he normally does, or than some of his opponents did on the same stage yesterday. He segued by bragging\u2014as almost every candidate speaking here has\u2014about his marriage and fecundity (sixteen grandchildren!). \"Marriage is more than a personally rewarding social custom,\" said Romney. \"It is also critical for the well-being of a civilization.  That is why it's so important to preserve traditional marriage\u2014the joining together of one man and one woman. And that's why I will appoint an attorney general who will defend the bipartisan law passed by Congress and signed by Bill Clinton\u2014the Defense of Marriage Act.\" Romney went into detail on the ways that he would combat abortion: \"I support the Hyde Amendment, which broadly bars the use of federal funds for abortions. As president, I will end federal funding for abortion advocates like Planned Parenthood. I will protect a healthcare worker's right to follow their conscience in their work.  And I will nominate judges who know the difference between personal opinion and the law. It is long past time for the Supreme Court to return the issue of abortion back to the states, by overturning Roe v. Wade.\" Romney then riffed on the evils of China's policies regarding reproduction and took a swipe at Vice President Joe Biden's offhand remark that he understands their one-child policy. (This has become a fixation on the right.) The audience cheered enthusiastically, including several standing ovations. But seeing the rebuke that would come from Fischer immediately after, Romney struck the first blow. \"We should remember that decency and civility are values too,\" said Romney. \"One of the speakers to follow me today has crossed that line, I think. Poisonous language doesn't advance our cause, it's never softened a single heart or changed a single mind.\" Fischer has previously uncivilly suggested that the First Amendment only applies to Christians, and that Mormons are non-Christians so its protections do not apply to them. Fischer opened by noting that the president \"needs to be a main of sincere, authentic, genuine Christian faith.\" He then listed the beliefs a president must hold. Fischer has some high expectations. \"We need a president who thinks Roe versus Wade was not just unconstitutional but profoundly immoral,\" said Fischer. Adding, \"We need a president who understands we must choose between homosexuality and liberty and will choose liberty every time.\" Fischer said a president must \"reject the morally and scientifically bankrupt theory of evolution.\" Finally, Fischer transitioned into an ugly anti-Muslim section by saying, \"I believe it's important that we have a president who understands that Islam is not a religion of peace but a religion of war and violence and death.\" Fischer was not the first speaker to imply that Romney is unacceptable. Michele Bachmann, speaking Friday night, assured the audience that \"You won't find YouTube clips of me speaking in support of Roe versus Wade. You won't find me equivocating or hemming or hawing when I'm asked to define marriage as between one man and one woman.\" Bachmann also repeatedly pleaded with the audience not \"compromise\" or \"settle\" for a \"moderate.\" While Bachmann stuck to Romney's policy weaknesses, Baptist pastor Robert Jefress, who introduced Rick Perry yesterday, asked \"Do we want a candidate who is a conservative out of convenience or one who is a conservative out of deep conviction? Do we want a candidate who is a good, moral person\u2014or one who is a born-again follower of the lord Jesus Christ?\" He later told reporters that Mormonism is a \"cult.\" The fundamentalism on display here may not be a cult, but it is every bit as pernicious and un-Christian. Update: I asked Tony Perkins, the President of FRC, in a press conference Saturday afternoon why Fischer was scheduled to speak after Romney. He said it was a coincidence necessitated by the various speakers' schedules and there was no reason or ulterior motive.",

Tens of thousands of registered nurses held a strike at more than thirty hospitals to protest proposed cuts to benefits.  Registered nurses hold signs as they strike outside of the Mills-Peninsula hospital on Sept. 22, 2011 in Burlingame, California. Tens of thousands of registered nurses held a strike at more than thirty hospitals to protest proposed cuts to benefits. Read Another Opinion On Healthcare And The Obama Administration  Pema Levy is an assistant editor at The American Prospect. In one of its many attempts to get its budget deficit under control, in 2008 California decided to cut its reimbursement rates to medical providers for poor and disabled persons enrolled in the state's Medicaid program. The result was that providers began to cut back on services, and pharmacists stopped filling prescriptions because the reimbursements came to less than the cost of the drugs. California, for all intents and purposes, was no longer upholding the federal mandate to provide Medicaid patients with \"meaningful access\" to care. Numerous lawsuits were filed against the state to reverse the cuts, and they are now consolidated into Douglas v. Independent Living Center of Southern California, the first case the Supreme Court will hear today, on the first day of its new term. As it stands, Douglas is no longer about Medicaid rates or \"meaningful access,\" but whether Medicaid beneficiaries and providers have the right to sue the state to enforce federal Medicaid statutes \u2014 and, in a surprising move, the Obama administration has sided with California, with the Deputy Solicitor General arguing before the Court today that only the Department of Health and Human Services should be able to enforce compliance with Medicaid. \"They want the prerogative of when and where to intervene in state conduct matters,\" says Sara Rosenbaum, a law professor and health care expert at George Washington  University, venturing a guess as to the administration's motives. California's backers also worry about court-imposed payment schemes replacing state discretion, as well as a surge in litigation. But the Obama administration's position is a big mistake. Not only would rolling back such private rights endanger patients and providers, it could also impede the administration's own agenda. Because the ability of the federal government to enforce its health care laws through HHS is limited, it often relies on private lawsuits to keep states in check. In fact, the success of the administration's signature policy achievement, the Affordable Care Act, could depend on exactly the kind of action it's trying to rule out. OF THE 32 MILLION Americans the Obama administration's Affordable Care Act will eventually insure, almost half \u2014 15 million \u2014 will gain insurance under a massive Medicaid expansion by January 2014. The impact of the ACA, in other words, depends on states complying with Medicaid requirements \u2014 the very laws Douglas could effectively end the ability of private citizens to enforce through legal action. Another scenario where you might see the ACA falter is if a state took over responsibility for running a health-care exchange, and then failed to comply with federal requirements in some way. A ruling against providers and beneficiaries in Douglas therefore \"limits the options for enforcing the Affordable Care Act,\" says Timothy Jost, a law professor at Washington and Lee University School of Law. \"At this point the assumption is that the states will implement it and that the federal government will enforce it. The possibility to enforce implementation [either through private actions or HHS] is a fall-back position. But in the future, particularly if Obama loses the 2012 election, it narrows options for making sure implementation goes through.\"   Even under a Democratic administration, however, leaving enforcement up to HHS is a disaster waiting to happen. That's because, historically, HHS has a middling record of enforcing Medicaid's rules. For instance, the California rate cuts that launched the lawsuit in question are still in effect, points out Rochelle Bobroff, Directing Attorney of the Federal Rights Project at the National Senior Citizens Law Center. \"The federal government never goes to court over non-conforming state plans,\" says Bobroff. \"They just don't do it.\" More importantly, HHS is largely limited to one, very poor enforcement mechanism: the ability to cut off all Medicaid funding to a noncompliant state. If the threat of a cutoff doesn't scare a state into compliance, following through would only end up hurting the Medicaid recipients HHS is trying to help. Under a president Bachmann or Perry and their HHS Secretary, says Jost, \"you'd have a situation where [the ACA] was basically unenforceable with regard to the Medicaid expansion.\"   Moreover, the ACA is just one piece of the possible collateral damage from a ruling in favor of California. Under a broad ruling, a whole swath of federal requirements could be endangered. \"Every state out there is waiting to see what happens in Douglas to cut access,\" says Rosenbaum. \"The litany of what kind of bad state conduct could be unleashed is long because the only weapon against it is the risk of injunction. The theory that there's no right of action will carry over out of the Medicaid Act.\"  One area where states would likely begin to move in response to a victory for California is in cutting federal money \u2014 like Medicaid and Title X funding\u2014that's currently directed to abortion clinics and Planned Parenthood. The ability of beneficiaries and providers to stop state laws seeking to defund clinics would likely be impeded, allowing backers of the proverbial \"war\" on abortion and contraception to score a major victory. And with an especially broad ruling, says Steven Shapiro, legal director for the ACLU, \"there would be consequences for a wide-ranging variety for civil liberties and civil rights litigation [including] state and local immigration cases.\" This all depends, of course, on if the state of California wins in Douglas, and then how broad the Court's ruling actually is. The poor tools at HHS's disposal are partly a result of the fact that the government has historically relied heavily on private actions to enforce federal laws. For this reason it seems unlikely that the Court will take away private citizens' cause of action altogether, as a broad ruling would overturn a large number of cases and go against decades of established jurisprudence. But on the other hand, a narrow ruling seems likely. \"It's hard to be optimistic with 32 states and the federal government [on the other side]; this is going to be a difficult case to win,\" says Bobroff. \"Given this Supreme Court and its hostility to plaintiffs,\" Jost notes, \"it's depressing.\"  It's important to note that the Obama administration is taking a more moderate position and is asking the Court for a narrow ruling on the Medicaid Act alone. But its decision to back the state of California over private beneficiaries and providers is still baffling for heath care advocates and experts. Even a narrow ruling could impede the implementation of health care reform. \"I have no idea what they were thinking, but it's a major disappointment,\" says Shapiro. \"They went against their historic and the legally correct position.\" Indeed, when the Supreme Court was deciding whether to hear Douglas, the administration's position was that private actions were important to carrying out federal law. When the Court took up the case, however, the administration performed a remarkable about-face. \"There's a huge amount riding on this case,\" says Rosenbaum, \"and the ironies here are phenomenal.\"",

Hundreds of tea party supporters rallied in northern and southern Nevada on Friday to urge lawmakers not to raise taxes. Jonathan Bernstein is a political blogger. Do the surprise victories of Sharron Angle and Christine O'Donnell in the 2010 Senate Republican primaries mean that seemingly fringe candidates like Michele Bachmann, Herman Cain, or even Ten Commandments judge Roy Moore have a chance? That's what many pundits have been saying. Indeed, just last week, TNR's own Jonathan Chait touted Bachmann's chances by observing that \"the 2010 election cycle featured a long series of conservative upstarts shocking the mainstream media by knocking off establishment-approved candidates in nominating contests.\" A presidential nominating contest isn't so different, he noted, because it's just \"a series of state-level nominating primaries generally dominated by an activist base.\" While that may be generally true, a careful look back at 2010's surprise Senate primary victories reveals more differences than similarities with the upcoming GOP presidential nominating contest. To begin, one issue with Bachmann and Cain isn't how conservative they are, but rather that backbench members of the House and talk show hosts (or, if you prefer, pizza magnates) don't exactly have conventional credentials. This is one key difference between them and, say, Marco Rubio, who had been Speaker of the Florida House of Representatives before demolishing Florida's governor and becoming a senator. I'd put Rand Paul, another conservative candidate who managed to pull off a primary upset, in this category as well: Being Ron Paul's son ensured instant and generally favorable name recognition among primary voters. But what about the successful Republican nominees in 2010 who didn't have conventional credentials \u2014 Sharron Angle in Nevada, Christine O'Donnell in Delaware, Joe Miller in Alaska, and Mike Lee in Utah? Don't they provide a precedent that should give hope to Bachmann and Cain? Let's start with Mike Lee in Utah. He didn't have to run in a primary with a large electorate; he defeated incumbent Senator Bob Bennett at a state party convention, following a very low-visibility set of caucuses. It's a stretch to compare that process even to the Iowa caucuses, and presidential candidates must win large primaries as well. Sharron Angle, on the other hand, won a multicandidate primary with 40 percent of the vote in Nevada. That's impressive, and suggests that a candidate without normal credentials might do well in Iowa and New Hampshire before the field narrows, but it says little about what would happen, eventually, in a two-person contest, in which a candidate must be able to win more than half of the votes. John McCain in 2008 was one of the most marginal winners ever, but he was able to clear 50 percent in several states \u2014 New York, New Jersey, and Connecticut \u2014 and come close in others, even with several candidates still in the race. Then, once it was down to McCain, Mike Huckabee, and Ron Paul, McCain had no trouble at all clearing 50 percent. What about Joe Miller in Alaska and Christine O'Donnell in Delaware? Neither of them had conventional qualifications for office, and both won head-to-head contests in primary elections. But there's a major factor in both contests that almost certainly won't be present in the 2012 Republican presidential race: Both Miller and O'Donnell faced opponents who were squishy, at best, on the core Republican issue of abortion. Senator Lisa Murkowski in Alaska is a moderate on the issue; her interest group ratings have been all over the place over the years, and she had to defend the votes that gave her a 100 percent rating from the National Family Planning and Reproductive Health Association in 2007-2008. In Delaware, Mike Castle had a similarly mixed record, with just a 10 percent score from the National Right to Life Committee in 2006. No one who reaches the final round of the presidential race on the Republican side will be a moderate on abortion, so these examples, too, don't really tell us much about how 2012 could unfold. (Mitt Romney may be weak on the issue because of his past positions, but conversion is a completely different story from ongoing squishiness.) Upon closer inspection, what the 2010 races really tell us is that in low-profile elections \u2014 and state nomination battles are relatively low publicity even when they are as hotly contested as some of these were \u2014 odd things can happen. But none of them, it turns out, were as odd as it would be for Bachmann or Cain to win a presidential nomination.",

Merkel recently announced that Germany will nix dependency on nuclear power by 2022. Paul Hockenos is author of Joschka Fischer and the Making of the Berlin Republic: An Alternative History of Postwar Germany. Germany's decision this week to turn its back on nuclear power by 2022 and embrace a future fueled by renewable energy may have been historic, but it was hardly the product of a political visionary. German Chancellor Angela Merkel arrived at this achievement almost despite herself, and only by means of a conspicuous and careening political U-turn. Although the new nuclear policy is a real cause for celebration for Germans, Merkel, try as she might, can't plausibly bask in the limelight: In the words of German newsmagazine Der Spiegel, \"It's as if the pope were suddenly advocating the use of birth control pills.\" In keeping with the rest of her tenure as chancellor of Germany, Merkel's scrapping of nuclear energy has been stumbling and reactive, not confident and bold. In Europe, Germany's goodbye to the atom \u2014 as the world's fourth-largest industrial nation \u2014 is being compared in its political magnitude to reunification at the end of the Cold War. But while Helmut Kohl's deliberate diplomacy in 1990 secured him a place in history \u2014 and two more terms in office \u2014 Merkel is suffering miserably at the polls and in the press. Indeed, it's impossible for political opponents and the media to resist pointing out that her conservative coalition's new stance on nuclear energy amounts to a drastic volte-face on one of its signature electoral platforms: Merkel's latest plan directly contradicts a law passed just six months earlier, designed to extend the operating lives of Germany's nuclear energy facilities by up to 14 years. No, it wasn't foresight or vision behind the new policies, but desperation. In the face of overwhelming public skepticism of nuclear power in the wake of Japan's Fukushima disaster, a Green Party topping Merkel's Christian Democrats in regional elections, and an anti-nuclear energy movement mobilizing hundreds of thousands in the streets, Merkel believed she had no other choice. The real kudos go to Germany's tenacious anti-nuclear opponents, who over four decades never wavered from their insistence that nuclear power had no future in Germany. Unsurprisingly, the environmentalists who are cautiously sizing up the newly accelerated phase-out aren't tempted to give Merkel a smidgen of credit for something she and her conservative party long resisted. Merkel latest policy shift has thus put her government in a quandary, sacrificing the wishes of her coalition's conservative base \u2014 and, critically, the powerful nuclear energy lobby in southern Germany \u2014 without plausibly picking up any new voters from elsewhere on the political spectrum. Were national elections held today, her conservative-liberal alliance would be trounced, and rightfully so. A share of the blame certainly goes to the Christian Democrats' junior partner, the Free Democrats, whose missteps and unhappy figure in the foreign ministry, Guido Westerwelle, have contributed to the free fall of the coalition's popularity. But Merkel's flimsy leadership and singular lack of vision are the real grounds for the crisis. It has become impossible to decipher what Merkel really believes in, a puzzle reflected in her administration's meager record. It seems an eternity ago that Merkel won Germans' hearts and votes. Kohl took her under his wing in the 1990s, but it was Merkel, and Merkel alone, who made the most of her opportunity in a Catholic, male-dominated, thoroughly West German party that direly needed modernizing. Merkel stood out in every way: an East German, female, Protestant, professional, twice-married, childless physicist. In contrast with Germany's traditional alpha-male politicos, her unglamorous style, straight talk, and down-to-earth manner were a welcome relief. Her unique biography and outsider status made her the perfect person to sweep aside cobwebbed thinking and challenge the interests that were blocking reform in her party and the republic at large. But that was then. Since taking the country's top office in 2005, she has flip-flopped so many times that her twists and turns have become impossible to keep track of. Candidate Merkel originally ran on a radical free-market platform that went over so badly with voters that Gerhard Schr\u00f6der's Social Democrats very nearly snatched victory from the jaws of certain defeat six years ago. Thereafter, Merkel became overnight a convincing spokesperson for the social welfare state, even reversing some of the Social Democrats' more dramatic liberalizing reforms. And then there was Merkel the \"Climate Chancellor,\" who as European Council president in 2008 boxed through tough carbon dioxide emissions standards for the continent. In no time, though, she was pushing through exceptions for Germany's auto industry, producer of Europe's most notorious gas guzzlers. So too on other EU affairs. Merkel was briefly heralded for her pro-Europe convictions, as the legitimate heir of her mentor Kohl. But in dealing with the European financial crisis, her instinct has been to play to Germany's id, rather than its superego. Her recent broadside about southern Europeans' early retirement ages and long vacations \u2014 in other words, their laziness \u2014 went over well in Germany's tabloid press, precisely because they fanned the latent anti-EU sentiments smoldering in the country. A truly worthy heir of Kohl would have explained to the average burgher in plain-speak that Germany profits enormously from exports to southern Europe and the European Union in general. At a time when the German economy is booming, this should have been possible \u2014 and would have boosted Germany into the role of EU guarantor rather than priming it to view Europe as its adversary. Nor has Merkel's foreign policy displayed consistency that hints at any bigger-picture plan. When in the opposition, she took Schr\u00f6der's left-leaning \"Red-Green\" government to task for spurning the U.S.-led coalition on Iraq. Yet when it came to aiding the Libyan rebels trying to overthrow Muammar al-Qaddafi \u2014 a mission considerably less dodgy than ousting Saddam Hussein in 2003 \u2014 Berlin opted to sit it out, for reasons no one in Merkel's government can quite explain. It's no wonder that U.S. President Barack Obama flew straight over Germany on his recent trip to Europe, an unprecedented snub in the history of transatlantic relations. Since Europe's most powerful woman took office, Germany has undeniably lost clout in the international arena, and its dreams of a permanent U.N. Security Council seat are now pure fantasy.  Merkel's fans call her a pragmatist, one not keen to fight losing battles and with an appetite for sniffing out political consensus. The flip-flop on nuclear energy, say these admirers, is another example of how she can employ her ideological flexibility to defend her party's gains in a hostile political landscape. According to this theory, Merkel was smart enough not only to recognize that her energy policies in the wake of Fukushima were no longer tenable, but also that the implosion of the Free Democrats has made the reelection of her coalition a near impossibility. The only chance for Merkel to remain chancellor after 2013, then, is as head of a Christian Democrat-Green coalition. Even though the Greens have condemned the conditions of Merkel's nuclear pullout plan as inadequate, a \"Nein, danke\" to nuclear power is a nonnegotiable precondition for a \"black-green\" coalition, the likes of which have already popped up in smaller German cities and states. Some observers even say she has cleverly stolen the left-wing opposition's trump card and will win back voters by making Germany a model for clean, energy-efficient states with a thriving trade in solar panels and wind turbines. Finally, a vision! Even if it's not hers.  But it's hard to believe that Merkel can credibly reinvent herself again as the \"ecology chancellor\" and simply follow the path of least resistance to another term in office. In fact, her dramatic confirmation of Green policies will probably put wind in the sails of the original environmental party, cementing its status as a viable alternative to both the Social Democrats and the Christian Democrats. What Merkel may well have done is pave the way for the first-ever Green chancellor in 2013, as head of a ruling coalition like the one currently in the southwestern region of Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg. If this happens, Merkel will certainly be a chancellor for the German history books, if not in the way she may have wished.",

Cain, who has never held an elected office, has run a pizza chain, hosted a talk radio show and sparred with Bill Clinton over health care.\n                \n                    \n                    David Goldman/ASSOCIATED PRESS\n                    \n                \nhide caption Herman Cain announces his run for Republican candidate for president at a May 21 rally in Atlanta. Cain, who has never held an elected office, has run a pizza chain, hosted a talk radio show and sparred with Bill Clinton over health care. Ed Kilgore is a special correspondent for The New Republic. Among the many striking features of Georgia-based radio talk show host Herman Cain's presidential announcement speech in Atlanta on May 21, the most surreal was to hear an African-American in front of a heavily white audience of hard-core conservatives, at a site within shouting distance of the Martin Luther King Center, end his remarks by declaring, \"When Herman Cain is president, we will finally be able to say, 'Free at last, free at last, thank God almighty, America is free at last.'\" Cain's decision to appropriate those famous words from King's \"I Have a Dream\" speech is in many ways characteristic of the man himself and the kind of campaign he's been running. But give him credit: Outperforming Tim Pawlenty in many recent polls, running tied for second in Tuesday's latest PPP poll of Iowa, Cain is surging on the backs of the Tea Party faithful. He is nothing if not audacious, and his popularity is due in large part to the fact that he has come to embody some of the more dubious but emotionally central claims of the Tea Party Movement. The first thing Cain has going for his fan-base is his biography. He's a successful business executive who saved at least one company, Godfather's Pizza. He made his bones on the national political stage by attacking the Clinton Health Reform plan in 1994. And after liquidating his business holdings, he became a motivational speaker and author, with many opportunities to hone his communications skills. Following his one, unsuccessful race for office \u2014 a surprisingly strong showing that resulted in a runoff loss to now-Senator Johnny Isakson \u2014 Cain worked his way into the world of conservative talk radio under the tutelage of the veteran quasi-libertarian gabber Neal Boortz, who has a big national audience. He soon got his own syndicated show, in which he identified himself with one of the most durable conservative pet rocks, the Fair Tax proposal (a flat consumption tax that would theoretically replace federal income and payroll taxes). And unlike other pols who have since tried to ingratiate themselves with the movement, Cain was a big Tea Party proponent from day one, quickly becoming a fixture at Tea Party events in Georgia. And then, of course, there's one other item in Cain's background that matters politically: his race. Cain's popularity among conservative activists provides a sort of ongoing inoculation against the charges of racism that have been levied \u2014 sometimes speciously, sometimes fairly \u2014 against them, and he cleverly cultivates this element of his popularity with the stock-speech line, \"People who oppose Obama are said to be racists \u2014 so I guess I'm a racist.\" Like South Carolina congressman Tim Scott and Florida congressman Allen West, as a hard-core conservative African-American Cain has quickly become one of the most popular pols in the Tea Party universe. But beyond serving as a counter-race-card, Cain's rhetoric offers vital ammunition in the fight over the endlessly contested American value of \"opportunity.\" Indeed, at a time when many white Americans believe that anti-white bias is now a greater social problem than anti-black bias, Cain's words and deeds coincide nicely with the common conservative belief that minorities who embrace traditional values, work hard, and become entrepreneurs can avoid the liberal \"welfare trap\" that leads to dependence on government, broken homes, and crime. And Cain's angry defiance of liberals validates the Tea Party conviction that white liberal elites have corrupted minority Americans by, for instance, encouraging them to take out mortgages they couldn't afford, thus triggering the recent housing and financial crises. In other words, Cain has become not a role model but an implicit living rebuke to his fellow African-Americans, who have, in the imaginations of many white conservatives, been led like sheep to the slaughter by the shadowy forces who use them as pawns in their socialist schemes. Nothing illustrates Cain's ability to turn his race into a weapon against white liberals than the racial spin he has placed on the abortion-as-Holocaust meme of the anti-choice movement (of which he is a long-time champion, at least since he spent most of his 2004 senatorial campaign attacking Johnny Isakson for favoring rape-and-incest exceptions to a hypothetical ban on abortions). Here's what he told the conservative website CNSNews.com in March of this year regarding his support for congressional Republican efforts to ban any use of public funds by Planned Parenthood: Here's why I support de-funding Planned Parenthood, because you don't hear a lot of people talking about this, when Margaret Sanger \u2014 check my history \u2014 started Planned Parenthood, the objective was to put these centers in primarily black communities so they could help kill black babies before they came into the world. You don't see that talked that much about ... It's not Planned Parenthood. No, it's planned genocide. You can quote me on that. This sort of talk is immensely useful \u2014 and powerful \u2014 for conservative activists who have a complicated view of minority Americans as both perpetrators and victims in the ongoing destruction of the country as they know it. In this as in other areas, the third thing going for Cain is simple: He does not hold back. Indeed, he gives conservative audiences the full, rich, red-meat diet they crave, along with the occasional dog-whistle appeal only they can hear. For example, in his announcement speech, he made a casual reference to the Constitution's language guaranteeing \"life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness.\" Since the language in question appears in the Declaration of Independence, not the Constitution, Cain was subsequently accused of an ignorant gaffe by observers who themselves did not seem to understand the Christian Right/Tea Party tenet that the former document was incorporated into the latter via the manifest intent of the Founders. This is how God and the idea of divinely derived \"natural law\" (including protection of the unborn and, for some, absolute property rights) are read into the Constitution by constitutional conservatives who consider twentieth-century social legislation and court rulings un-American. Add all these factors up, and it's not that surprising Cain has been wowing audiences in early caucus and primary states and developing the kind of online following that only Ron Paul can typically command among Republicans. He has routinely won audience straw polls after candidate forums \u2014 most famously, at the Tea Party Patriots convention in Arizona in February and at Steve King's Conservative Principles Conference in Iowa in April. He also greatly enthused a focus group convened by conservative pollster Frank Lutz to watch the first televised candidate debate in South   Carolina in May. As a result, he's now surging in the polls (registering 8 percent in the latest Gallup poll of Republican presidential proto-candidates, 10 percent in the latest CNN poll, and 11 percent in a recent Insider Advantage poll), and regularly running ahead of supposedly more serious candidates like Tim Pawlenty and Michele Bachmann. And all this is happening, as Nate Silver has pointed out, in spite of the fact that Cain still has low name ID and hasn't, until now at least, gotten much media attention (in both respects, this is the exact opposite of the context surrounding Donald Trump's earlier surge in the polls). So is Cain for real? Could he, not T-Paw, become the much-discussed true conservative alternative to Mitt Romney, rolling into South  Carolina for a mano-a-mano confrontation with the supposed front-runner on his own Deep South turf? It's possible, but it's also more likely that with his new visibility, Cain will now face many new pressures. For one, a serious campaign has to have money. Cain is a millionaire, but is hardly in the same league as Romney or Huntsman as a self-funder. He is not averse to rattling a cup for contributions, but has nothing like the fundraising record of Bachmann or Gingrich. More importantly, Cain's free ride with opponents and the media is certain to end. As his campaign morphs from a sideshow into an existential threat to the ambitions of Bachmann and Gingrich, and a potential problem for T-Paw (who could still finish behind Cain in Iowa and survive until South Carolina, so long as the other \"true conservative\" rivals to Romney got killed off), they will inevitably train their guns on him. And there may be a limit to the value Cain derives from the novelty of a black conservative angling to become the challenger to the first black president. Most of all, Cain will have problems with expanded media coverage unless he adjusts very rapidly. His cheerful indifference towards foreign affairs and national security issues \u2014 he's said he'd figure out what to do in Afghanistan at some point between Election Day and his inauguration \u2014 may reflect the attitudes of his core Tea Party base, but not Republican elites, much less voters at large. And given his lack of experience in office, gaffes and tokens of ignorance \u2014 e.g., his manifest cluelessness on the issue of the Palestinian \"right of return\" in a recent discussion of the Middle East \u2014 will hurt him just as they hurt Sarah Palin in 2008. Conservative opinion-leaders supporting other candidates will be sure to mention that Cain supported TARP and once served as Chairman of the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City. African-Americans are very likely to begin denouncing his denunciations of Obama and his appropriation of civil rights rhetoric. The Fair Tax gimmick which Cain has promoted for years is loaded with opposition-research dynamite. And in general, his whole act, including his habit of referring to himself in the third-person, could get old or weird. To be sure, in a year like 2012, with a field like today's Republican cast, you never know what will happen, and Cain has already done a better job of establishing himself than almost anyone expected. But odd as it may seem for a candidate most Americans are just now discovering, Herman Cain may have peaked too soon.",

Mitch Daniels won't happen. But a fierce GOP nomination fight seems guaranteed. Republicans who would rather Mitt Romney not get the GOP presidential nomination appear to be running out of options. With Indiana Gov. Mitch Daniels taking himself out of contention over the weekend for family reasons Romney, the former Massachusetts governor, has less to worry from a new and credible opponent who could have drawn money and key campaign personnel away from him. The same holds true for two other former governors, Tim Pawlenty of Minnesota, who officially announced Sunday and Monday he was in the race, and Jon Huntsman of Utah who's still unofficial. They need not worry now about a Daniels siphon effect. As for the other candidates, announced or potential, including Newt Gingrich, the former speaker, or members of Congress Ron Paul or Michele Bachmann, no to mention Herman Cain, they're such long shots, Daniels' decision to remain out of the race doesn't mean much one way or another. The national polls indicate Romney is the frontrunner which, in part, is because he came in second in the race for the GOP nomination in 2008. But his weaknesses as a candidate for the Republican nomination have led many in the party to yearn for an alternative. Among his supposed failings are that he signed into law in Massachusetts health care legislation that was the model for the national law Obama signed, making him a flawed messenger to attack the law Republicans call \"Obamacare\" He also has, fairly or not, gotten a reputation over the years as inconsistent on key issues like abortion rights which he earlier supported as a candidate for governor but later came to oppose, in time to be able to sell himself to his party's social conservatives as an anti-abortion candidate. The desire for someone other than Romney or the other possibilities in the field was the fertile soil from which the Daniels boomlet grew. Daniels was a conservative deficit hawk who impressed many by using the power the Indiana constitution gives to cut government spending. That kept Indiana from going as deep into the hole during the recession as other states. He solidified his appeal to social conservatives by recently signing legislation to bar Planned Parenthood in the state from receiving any tax payer dollars because, among its womens' health services, it provides abortions. But a Daniels candidacy would have provided Democrats with opportunities as well. For instance, Democrats have and would have continued to argue that Daniels was President George W. Bush's chief federal budget planner as director of the Office of Management and Budget when the Bush tax cuts contributed to budget surpluses becoming deficits. Democrats have also long blamed Daniels for significantly underestimating the financial costs of the Iraq War. Meanwhile, Daniels doesn't exactly cut quite the tall and dashing figure of a say a Romney or a Huntsman. As the National Journal's Alex Roarty wrote: That conservatives considered a 5-foot-7, 60-something, balding budget wonk one of their best chances to defeat President Obama is a testament to the pessimism many Republicans feel about their crop of presidential hopefuls. For all his budget bona fides, Daniels was still unknown and untested nationally. Only 35 percent of Republicans knew who he was, according to the latest Gallup poll, and unlike Romney, he had never faced the scrutiny reserved for front-running presidential candidates. An array of legislative achievements in Indiana also wouldn't erase the stark contrast he would face when shaking hands with the more telegenic, much taller Obama. With a frontrunner who many Republicans find unpalatable, the risk for Republicans is that their party becomes a months-long, running violation of Ronald Reagan's 11th commandment that \"Thou shalt not speak ill of any fellow Republican.\" Even if Daniels had entered the race, the contest for the nomination promised to be fierce since Romney appears to really believe he should be president at least as much as many in his party really believe he shouldn't. Daniels not entering the race just means there'll be one less combatant in the free-for-all that is the Republican nomination fight. That could very well result in a very damaged nominee if Romney eventually wins the prize. That could make him far easier pickings for an incumbent president who hopes to have $1 billion to spend on his re-election efforts and apparently will be leading a unified party. If you're the Obama's campaign team sitting in Chicago, that kind of internecine bloodying of Romney the frontrunner is exactly the outcome you're hoping for.",

A young Nancy D'Alesandro watched a friend reach her hand into a fishbowl filled with debate topics on little scraps of paper. She pulled one out and read. \"The question was this simple,\" Pelosi recalls. \"Do women think?\" For Pelosi, the memory is a reminder of how far she's come \u2014 from the daughter of a powerful mayor of Baltimore to a devoted wife and mother of five children. She always kept a hand in politics at the local and regional level. It wasn't until 1987, when her youngest daughter was a senior in high school, that Pelosi ran for office herself. As a member of Congress from San Francisco, she worked her way up, with high-profile posts on the House Appropriations Committee and Intelligence Committee. Then, it was Democratic leader, and in 2006, after her party swept the midterm elections, she became speaker of the House \u2014 the first woman in U.S. history to hold the post. 'It's Her Fault' Despite her work, she says, and the broadening role of women in society over the decades, Pelosi can still hear a certain edge in the voices of some men when they talk about her. When they say things like, \"She's doing it. It's her fault.\" \"I don't know if it's generational or what,\" she says, \"but sometimes using 'she' and 'her' instead of the name of the person is not really intended to be mean-spirited, I don't think \u2014 it's just the tone that goes with it. The only concern I have about the attacks that are made on me is that I don't want it to deter other women from saying, 'I want to go do that.' Nancy Pelosi \"So I don't have time to worry about all that. You know, I just don't have time to take offense or hold offense. It's not important. They're going to do it anyway, and the more effective you are, the more they're going to do it,\" she says. \"So you just have to decide: Do I care about that, or do I care about getting a job done? And as I say over and over again, we came to do a job.\" A quick Web search shows what she means. Pelosi is demonized and reviled by some, whose attacks seem focused on things like her appearance and her ambition, rather than her ideas. \"The only concern I have about the attacks that are made on me is that I don't want it to deter other women from saying, 'I want to go do that.' \" For This Generation, Full Speed Ahead After Democrats lost the House majority last November, Pelosi was elected minority leader, and Republicans took control of the House. Now, Pelosi worries that the attempt to defund Planned Parenthood, which provides birth control and women's health exams as well as abortions, is a setback. But then, she also thinks any leftover sexism in politics will die away. The public, she says, is way ahead of politics in terms of women in power. And the young women and girls of today prove it. Capitol Hill staffers hold signs while participating in the launching of the RNC-sponsored \"Fire Pelosi\" bus tour last September in Washington. The former House speaker says she doesn't have time to worry about the attacks on her. \"You just have to decide,\" she says. \"Do I care about that, or do I care about getting a job done?\"\n                \n                    \n                    Mark Wilson/Getty Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption Capitol Hill staffers hold signs while participating in the launching of the RNC-sponsored \"Fire Pelosi\" bus tour last September in Washington. The former House speaker says she doesn't have time to worry about the attacks on her. \"You just have to decide,\" she says. \"Do I care about that, or do I care about getting a job done?\" \"In my generation, it was like, halt. But in theirs, it's full speed ahead,\" she says. \"So I don't have any worry about what it means for my children and grandchildren \u2014 they'll have every opportunity. \"I was thinking of my mother today earlier, and I thought, 'Oh my gosh, if she were born some decades later, what she would have done?' Just a remarkable woman,\" she says. \"But it's about the future, and I think that nothing is more wholesome to the political process and the process of government than the greater participation of women.\" Pelosi's advice to women rising in their careers who meet resistance from someone with other ideas of a woman's proper role? \"It's their problem,\" she says. \"You know, it's the problem of these people who harbor this anger. And you can't let their anger take you down.\" Focus, she says. Don't get dragged into it. And the news showing women in politics more often as problems or props for their husband's political campaigns? You don't have to believe that story, Pelosi says. Just look at her: She was a girl who chose to use her life and career to answer the question, \"Do women think?\"",

            "article_content": "As the White House and Congress gear up for deficit reduction meetings, host Michel Martin speaks with Rep. Frederica Wilson (D-Fla.) about what she thinks is necessary to reduce the deficit. In a testimony to the House Budget Committee, she has focused on protecting investments in education, family planning and job training.  MICHEL MARTIN: I'm Michel Martin, and this is TELL ME MORE from NPR News. This week, we turn our attention back to pressing financial issues affecting this country. Vice President Joe Biden is expected to continue holding talks with members of Congress, to try to come up with an agreement on how to reduce the country's huge budget deficit. We wanted to take a closer look at the points of view that each side is bringing to the table, and perhaps points of view that are being overlooked. In a minute, we'll speak with the outspoken former chair of the Republican National Committee, Michael Steele. In his first op-ed since he left the chairmanship, he says the quote, wailing and gnashing of teeth, unquote, from both Republicans and Democrats when it comes to spending, taxes and debt, is just dishonest. That is coming up in just a few minutes. But first, we've called - once again - upon Florida congresswoman Frederica Wilson. She's a Democrat who represents parts of Broward County, as well as parts of the Miami-Dade County area. She's a freshman, and we've checked in with her several times this year since she was sworn in, for her perspective on the process and battles on Capitol Hill. And congresswoman Wilson joins us now on the phone from Miami, at the office of a mentoring program she's involved with. Thanks so much for joining us. FREDERICA WILSON: Oh, thank you. It's a pleasure to be with you again. MARTIN: Well first, I wanted to get your take on whether you have a sense of optimism about these talks, or not. As you know, you know, these conversations about the debt have been going on for quite some time. There have been high-level commissions, bipartisan commissions. Do you feel that there is a possibility of an agreement? WILSON: Well, Michel, there has to be. I have to have hope because we're running a government, and we have to come together and find a way to balance this budget. But we can't balance it on the backs of our babies and senior citizens. You know, budgets are all about choices and priorities and values. We've got to appeal to the American public so that they can appeal to their elected officials and understand that this country is in trouble, and we've got to solve this budget problem. MARTIN: Well, there are just very different perspectives on the way forward here. Republicans, as a group, are generally demanding big changes and entitlement spending. The Democrats are generally asking for tax increases, particularly on high-income individuals or high-net-worth individuals. For example, today the Times is reporting that Senate Democrats are moving forward with a plan to eliminate tax breaks for big oil companies, and then divert the savings to offset the deficit. But Republicans are saying they're not willing to even vote to raise the debt ceiling limit unless there is an agreement on spending cuts. So what would break the logjam? WILSON: Well, we have to stop giving tax breaks to the oil companies. And we cannot - we must not tamper with Medicare, Medicaid or Social Security. And I think to do so would be giving the Democrats a new majority in the House on a silver platter. So I think that the seniors in our community, and even the children of seniors, and people in our nation will fight this Medicare overhaul, and this Medicaid overhaul, that the Tea Party people are trying to push down the throats of the American people. They have gotten beat up about it. And I think that's what's going to be the logjam. I think that's going to break the logjam. MARTIN: But people who, well, as you know - you're only one of nine freshmen Democrats in your class - the reason that the House changed hands is that a lot of people who were, in fact, backed by the Tea Party were elected in the last election cycle. So their argument is that they have a mandate to do this. What do you say to that? WILSON: I say to them that the mandate is not to destroy Medicare. The mandate is not to destroy Medicaid. And the mandate is to leave - is not to destroy Social Security. So that's where we have a problem. This is all about choices and values and priorities. And all people need health care. And all seniors need the same kind of understanding and humane treatment - whether they are Republican, Democrat, independent, black, white, fat, skinny, whatever you are. They need Medicare. And we should not be tampering with Medicare to balance a budget while giving tax breaks to the very rich and to oil companies. MARTIN: And finally, before I let you go - and we're going to hear from Michael Steele in a minute, as I just mentioned - in a piece for The Root, he wrote that part of the problem here is that what he calls, quote-unquote, establishment types are just not willing to get off the dime. They're not willing to move off their positions in order to come to an agreement, and that that's what's going to have to happen if this problem is going to be solved. So what would you say to that? WILSON: Well, what people need to remember is that the debt exploded under President Bush, and that's what Michael Steele needs to understand. Through two wars that were not paid for; prescription drug deal that gave away billions to insurance companies that was not paid for; and massive tax cuts for the wealthiest 1 percent. He has to be real. We have to get behind closed doors and hammer these issues out, and come back to the table with a solution to help all people. And I think once the word gets out to Republicans, and to Tea Party people, about Medicare and Medicaid - they had town hall meetings here in Florida, Republican town hall meetings. And they were booed when they talked about Medicare and Medicaid, all up and down the coast of Florida. So that's going to be the breaking point. MARTIN: Congresswoman Frederica Wilson is a Democrat. She represents the 17th Congressional District of Florida. That includes parts of Broward County as well as parts of Miami-Dade County. And she joined us on the phone from Miami, where she's at a mentoring program that she's involved with in her district. Congresswoman, thank you so much for joining us once again. WILSON: Thank you.

            "article_content": "President Obama is scheduled to unveil his plan for cutting the deficit in a speech Wednesday afternoon.\n                \n                    \n                    Carolyn Kaster/AP\n                    \n                \nhide caption President Obama is scheduled to unveil his plan for cutting the deficit in a speech Wednesday afternoon. No one is expecting a bipartisan consensus any time soon over what to do about the nation's exploding deficit, and when to do it. Far from it. But what many government watchers agree has been unfolding in Washington is a historic and potentially authentic conversation over federal spending, taxes and the role of government in the lives of Americans \u2014 from family planning clinics to Social Security benefits. \"People used to say there's not a dime's worth of difference between Democrats and Republicans when it came to government spending,\" says Howard Gleckman of the Tax Policy Center. \"Now you are seeing a fundamental difference in the view of government between the two parties \u2014 a contrast we haven't had probably since the 1920s.\" President Obama will enter the partisan fray on Wednesday afternoon, with a much-anticipated speech at George Washington University in which he is expected to lay out his plan for tackling the deficit with a mix of spending cuts and tax increases on high earners. Earlier in the day, the president is scheduled to meet at the White House with Democratic and Republican congressional leaders to discuss his fiscal plans. The address, seen as a response to GOP Rep. Paul Ryan's recent budget blueprint will come two months after the president released his 2012 spending proposal. That White House plan has been widely viewed as a government-as-usual document with little attention to the nation's burgeoning obligations. Obama's budget \"envisioned a government hardly different than the one we have had for decades,\" Gleckman says. Ryan has called for more than $6.2 trillion in cuts, many unspecified, over the next decade, repeal of last year's health care overhaul legislation, and a wholesale re-making of Medicare and Medicaid funding and eligibility tests. His plan also includes tax cuts for high earners and corporations. Ryan's proposal has no chance of surviving Senate scrutiny or the president's veto pen, but it \u2014 and pressure from the Tea Party movement \u2014 has been the catalyst for what appears to be a broad, no-holds-barred examination of government in America in 2011. Meanwhile, there are efforts under way in the Senate by the so-called bipartisan \"Gang of Six\" senators working on a plan that aims to reduce the deficit by $4 trillion over 10 years. \"This is a defining time for our nation,\" says Alison Acosta Fraser, an economic policy expert at the conservative Heritage Foundation. \"We are really at a crossroads, and it's time for a conversation.\" Start It Up The president's appearance at George Washington University will come just days after Congress approved a stopgap agreement that avoided a government shutdown and as rhetoric sharpens over a looming vote on raising the government's current $14.3 trillion debt ceiling. The ceiling is the maximum amount the U.S. can borrow to cover its obligations. Without an increase, the government could ultimately default on its Treasury debt \u2014 something it has never done and which no one expects to happen. However, Republican leaders have said that in exchange for votes to raise the ceiling, they will be expecting White House concessions on program and spending cuts. The battle will be over what programs and how much. In his speech, Obama is expected to draw on a report issued in December by a bipartisan deficit reduction commission he established. The commission's plan, which failed to get enough support to move it to Congress, calls for cuts in military spending, raising the Social Security benefits retirement age and increasing tax revenue by cutting provisions like the one allowing deductions for mortgage interest payments. What Ryan Wants Gleckman credits the Tea Party movement with having a \"remarkable influence\" in focusing debate on the deficit. And the Heritage Foundation's Fraser is among those who credit Ryan, the Wisconsin congressman and chairman of the House budget committee, with forcing the Capitol Hill conversation \u2014 whether or not you agree with his aims. House Budget Committee Chairman Paul Ryan touts his 2012 federal budget during a news conference April 5.\n                \n                    \n                    J. Scott Applewhite/AP\n                    \n                \nhide caption House Budget Committee Chairman Paul Ryan touts his 2012 federal budget during a news conference April 5. \"How big do we want government to be? I don't want it to be big,\" Fraser says. \"How high do we want taxes? I don't want them high. \"Paul Ryan really jump-started that discussion; his budget would put the nation on a fundamentally different course,\" she says, \"and one that I, as a conservative, welcome and embrace.\" Ryan's plan has been excoriated by those who see it as an assault on the poor, elderly and sick, and a sop to the wealthy. At the Concord Coalition, a bipartisan organization dedicated to deficit reduction, executive director Robert Bixby notes that under Ryan's budget, entitlement programs actually eat up more of the federal budget than they would under Obama's original 2012 plan. Why? Because Ryan's proposal \"cuts so much from everything else,\" Bixby writes in the coalition's blog. \"Clearly, there is waste in these other programs and no serious deficit reduction plan can exempt them from scrutiny,\" he says of domestic programs. \"But can we really expect to maintain ourselves as the dominant world power,\" he asks, \"while investing in our domestic economy if retirement income and health care programs take up two-thirds to three-quarters of all federal dollars?\" In tackling the deficit, Ryan has not proposed any new revenue. In fact, he has called for cutting taxes on corporations and the nation's wealthiest individuals. Specifically, Ryan proposes repeal of last year's health care legislation. He'd consolidate the current six tax brackets, and lower the tax rate from 35 percent to 25 percent on high-income earners and corporations. And he would turn Medicare into a voucher program by 2022, ending direct government reimbursements to medical care providers and offering instead a set government subsidy to recipients. Medicaid, the program for poor Americans, would, under the Ryan plan, become a flat block grant to states \u2014 indexed for inflation and population growth, but not for medical costs. He provides no plan for addressing the costs of Social Security, which analysts say should remain solvent through 2037. \"In the Ryan plan, his solution to the deficit is to cut benefits programs for the elderly and poor, and to cut taxes for very rich people,\" says Gleckman, of the liberal-leaning Tax Policy Center. \"Is that going to fix the deficit? We don't know.\" Though few details of the president's deficit-reducing proposal have yet emerged, administration officials have said Obama favors a scalpel over a \"machete.\" He is expected to propose reductions in Medicaid and Medicare spending, as well as in military spending. Whether the president goes beyond promoting repeal of the Bush-era tax cuts for couples earning more than $250,000 is anyone's guess. No Choice Fraser, of the Heritage Foundation, says she and others \u2014 including those at the Concord Coalition, with whom she has worked \u2014 believe that Americans are ready for an \"adult conversation.\" \"There's a lot of noise out there, but they're ready to make tough choices if you give them straight talk,\" she said. Doing nothing, she said, is not a choice. But with presidential election politics already playing out (some potential GOP candidates have already distanced themselves from some of Ryan's proposals), Obama is expected to walk a middle line on Wednesday. He'll have to make clear that he has heard Americans' concerns about the deficit as a serious long-term problem that has to be fixed. There will likely be a call to reduce some benefits for the elderly and raise taxes on high earners. But no one expects a call to revolution a la Ryan. \"I just hope he doesn't call for another commission,\" Gleckman says.",

For the moment, the budget debate is all over but the shouting. After lawmakers reached an eleventh-hour deal Friday night, President Barack Obama signed a temporary spending bill into place Saturday to keep the lights on at government agencies while Congress prepares the final budget for a vote this week. Meanwhile, spending committee czars and their staffs are still laying out the specifics on the spending agreement, which will cut $38 billion over the next six months. The details are just starting to emerge, and lawmakers are realizing they've got a deal in hand, but not much else. Voting Blind \"It's a not a very pleasant experience to be forced to vote for something before you know the contents of it,\" says Rep. George Miller, a Democrat from California. But Republicans didn't have much more to go on, according to Allen West, a GOP freshman from Florida. \"We did our votes in the wee morning hours, and that was really it,\" he says. \"We have not had any other contact with leadership, with any other members of the conference, other than seeing people here at the Reagan airport.\" Miller is a veteran liberal lawmaker. West a freshman Republican, popular with Tea Party activists. NPR caught up with them on their way home to their districts. Their reactions tell the story of how tough this process of compromise has been. Neither was especially pleased with the deal. \"I am not celebrating, I'm not dancing in the end zone,\" West says. \"I think there's even more work that we have to do.\" For Republicans like West, the issue was the dollar value of spending cuts. Republicans have gone from seeking $100 billion in cuts during election time, to $61 billion at the start of the year, to the final figure of $38 billion. \"Everybody's talking about how historic that is \u2014 the largest-ever spending cut \u2014 but you know, we're also facing the largest-ever debt and deficit we've ever had,\" he says. \"When you put it in that context, it really is not historic.\" Meager Wins For Both Parties GOP wins include assurances that there will be a stand-alone vote over barring Planned Parenthood access to government money and on defunding the new health care law. House Speaker John Boehner revived the school voucher program in the District   of Columbia and a ban on the District using its own local tax money for family planning or abortion services. And there will be a ban on money for transferring prisoners from Guantanamo Bay to the States. Congress had already banned such transfers last year. But the GOP did not manage to bag the bigger game it was hunting in the forest of social policy. The ban on the EPA spending money to regulate greenhouse gas emissions was dropped. The defunding of NPR was dropped. The defunding of the federal family planning program \u2013 also dropped. But liberals like Miller weren't dancing in the end zone either. \"I don't consider this to be a great performance,\" he says. To get the trade-off on the policy riders, Democrats had to give on spending \u2014 to the tune of the largest budget cuts ever. There's a $1.1-billion cut across the board for discretionary spending and dozens of nips and tucks all over government, from Justice Department programs to subsidies for co-ops in the new health care law to the Pell Grant program for low-income college students. Democrats could only take solace in reworking the mix of cuts so that the Defense Department, certain transportation projects and other GOP favorites were hit, too. More Battles To Come But Miller says the brinkmanship of this debate is only a prelude to the debate on next year's budget and the vote on raising the nation's debt limit \u2013 expected to come later this spring. \"The stakes are going to get higher and those policy riders I do not believe will go away. I think they will be back and it's going to be very very tough negotiating,\" he says. The final formal budget bill, with all the details, will be revealed in the next few days so that lawmakers in both chambers can vote on it. The deal could still come apart, but judging by last week's showdown, most lawmakers are ready to move on \u2013 to the next one.",

Reports of the death of compromise in Washington are greatly exaggerated. That's one important message from the 11th-hour agreement that averted a partial shutdown of the federal government Friday night. \"No compromise\" has been the rallying cry of the Tea Party movement. Some Republican lawmakers have echoed that. But the agreement reached Friday was the epitome of compromise. Republicans had come into the negotiations demanding $61 billion in spending cuts from the remainder of fiscal year 2011 which ends in September. GOP lawmakers also wanted numerous policy riders on the legislation that would have placed  restrictions on social policies. They included the much-argued Planned Parenthood rider to bar the organization from receiving any federal funding. By the time negotiations ended late Friday, Republicans had agreed to $41 billion in cuts, including $2 billion in a stopgap bill that funds the government through next Thursday, and had dropped most of their policy riders. For their part, Democrats had initially offered a far smaller menu of cuts, then begrudgingly got up to about $30 billion before finishing about $11 billion above that level. Meanwhile, Senate Democrats agreed to allow votes on defunding the Affordable Care Act and Planned Parenthood and agreed that there would be no additional funding of Internal Revenue Service agents to enforce the new health care law's individual mandate provisions. The defunding votes aren't expected to pass in the Senate but, again, it was a a not inconsiderable concession by Democrats to promise the floor votes at all. The health care law vote, for instance, will likely cause heartburn for some Democrats facing tough re-election fights, like Sen. Clair McCaskill of Missouri and Sen. Ben Nelson of Nebraska. That a compromise was possible and a shutdown averted at least proves that Democrats and Republicans are capable of bridging fierce differences, if only when they are staring into the abyss. Heading into the fights over raising the federal debt-ceiling as well as the fiscal 2012 budget, the agreement establishes what is possible. Not that those fights will be easy. The dynamics of each of those will be different because of their greater significance. The debt ceiling is about the \"full faith and credit\" of the U.S., which has even greater long-term consequence than the 2011 budget. And the 2012 budget fight will in large part be a battle over the future of the Medicare and Medicaid entitlements. But with lawmakers clearly blinking at the prospect of shutting down the government if even for a few days, it's difficult to imagine them wanting to cause a worldwide financial disruption by failing to increase the debt ceiling. Of the three major players in the shutdown showdown, Speaker John Boehner probably had the most to gain and lose if the government had been forced to partially close. The other major players, President Obama and Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, had already proven their ability to get major complicated legislation over the finish line, past resistance in their own and opposition parties. If Boehner hadn't been able to close a deal, it would have thrown into doubt his ability to deliver during future negotiations with the White House and Senate. Instead, he has achieved an important success. He showed he can ride herd on his Tea Party firebrands enough to successfully close a deal like the spending agreement. He can also take credit for forcing Democrats to accept a historic level of spending cuts. Boehner told reporters late Friday: \"As you all know, this has been a lot of discussion and a long fight.  But we fought to keep government spending down because it really will, in fact, help create a better environment for job creators in our country.\" But Democrats were spinning the agreement as a victory, too. The hallmark of a compromise is when both sides can claim a win. Obama's reaction to the agreement was upbeat and confident, as though things had worked out exactly as he had envisioned. With the Washington Monument clearly visible through the White House window behind him, the president provided viewers a visual reminder of what was averted, the closing of tourist attractions like the world's most famous obelisk. But what was particularly striking was how quickly the president moved to co-opt the Republican spending-cut message. Obama said: \"This agreement between Democrats and Republicans, on behalf of all Americans, is  on a budget that invests in our future while making the largest annual spending  cut in our history.  Like any worthwhile compromise, both sides had to make  tough decisions and give ground on issues that were important to them.  And I  certainly did that. \"Some of the cuts we agreed to  will be painful. Programs people rely on will be cut back.  Needed  infrastructure projects will be delayed.  And I would not have made these cuts  in better circumstances. \"But beginning to live within  our means is the only way to protect those investments that will help America  compete for new jobs \u2014 investments in our kids' education and student loans; in  clean energy and life-saving medical research.  We protected the investments we  need to win the future.\" As a sign of how far the discussion has shifted in Washington since Election Day, Reid also spoke of the importance of spending cuts.

The standoff could force the federal government to close on Friday. Ari Berman is a contributing writer for The Nation magazine and an Investigative Journalism Fellow at The Nation Institute. InTrade says there's a 52 percent chance there will be a government shutdown before July. The brinksmanship and theatrics aside, I've long believed a shutdown would be averted and a budget deal reached for 2011\u201312. Now I'm not so sure. Some in the GOP are eagerly cheering on the prospect of a shutdown (literally), with the conservative Republican Study Committee even unveiling a countdown clock on its website (as of this post, there's two days, ten hours, three minutes and five seconds left). A mixture of Republican stubbornness and Democratic timidity has brought us to this point. Democratic leaders could have passed a budget before the 2010 elections or during the lame-duck Congress, when they held large Congressional majorities, but by punting on the issue, they empowered the new House Republican majority, whose number-one issue in the 2010 election was cutting government spending. In February 2011, House Republicans passed $60 billion in spending cuts for 2011 by targeting the usual suspects \u2014 eliminating funding for Planned Parenthood, preventing the EPA from regulating greenhouse gas emissions, blocking the implementation of healthcare reform, cutting off support for NPR, PBS and AmeriCorps. Their bill looked much more like an effort to defang longtime opponents and score political points than a responsible attempt to actually balance the budget or create jobs. Goldman Sachs predicted that the plan would halt economic growth by 1.5 to 2 percentage points in the coming year, while Moody's forecast it would cost 700,000 jobs. Since then, Congress has twice temporarily kept the government running, and it looked as if John Boehner and Congressional Democrats had recently struck a deal to cut $33 billion from the budget for 2011-2012. But Boehner denied there was any deal, and promptly upped the number to $40 billion in cuts. Every time a deal looks imminent, the GOP raises the stakes, in the hopes that Democrats will take the bait (a pretty good assumption, given the deal reached to extend all the Bush tax cuts in December 2010). And these negotiations have been held in secret, so no one actually knows what any final deal will entail (how reassuring). Shutdown or not, the public is unlikely to be happy with the final outcome. What would a shutdown look like? Here's how CBS News described what happened in 1995: The shutdown resulted in a backlog of hundreds of thousands of passport and college applications, the closure of national parks (including the Grand Canyon), failure to process new Medicare claims and the suspension of many government services. In addition, 760,000 federal workers were furloughed during the impasse. (Their pay was reinstated when Mr. Clinton signed a measure to fund the government in early 2006.) The Office of Management and Budget estimated that the 21-day shutdown, together with a six-day partial government shutdown in November 1995, ended up costing more than $1.25 billion. Another shutdown could force troops to fight without pay and would likely imperil the country's fragile economic recovery. It would make both parties appear like squabbling adolescents (even more than they already do) and reinforce the belief that Washington is ungovernable, which would ultimately hurt President Obama, who wants to seem like a bipartisan problem-solver. That's why Obama pollster Cornell Belcher told me a few months ago that that a shutdown today would be \"devastating for both parties.\" Despite the alarming projections of how the House Republican budget would harm the country, it's the Democrats who have been on the defensive during the budget debate, principally because President Obama has declined to seriously engage in the discussions or outline an alternative narrative on the economy that is distinct from the GOP. Though they hold only one house of Congress, House Republicans act like they're in control of the entire government, with little pushback from the White House or Senate Democrats. Both parties now endorse the idea that spending cuts are the best cure for our ailing economy, even though there is no evidence that is the case. Obama has said that he was perceived as too much of a \"tax and spend liberal Democrat\" in the last election, so his administration has moved to the right as a result \u2014 despite the fact that poll after poll shows that the public believes the unemployment rate is a far more pressing problem than the deficit. \"The White House, in particular, has effectively surrendered in the war of ideas,\" New York Times columnist Paul Krugman wrote recently. \"It no longer even tries to make the case against sharp spending cuts in the face of high unemployment.\" Throughout this budget fight, we've been having the wrong economic debate, as my colleague Katrina vanden Heuvel noted this week. Both our political and media class are guilty of focusing obsessively on spending cuts while ignoring the public's overriding priority: jobs. House Republican Budget Committee Chairman Paul Ryan, an instant media darling, raised the stakes of the debate this week by finally unveiling his radical budget plan for 2012 amidst much fanfare and coverage. Here's how the Economic Policy Institute characterized what Ryan's plan would do: The budget, among other things, includes a plan to privatize Medicare by forcing recipients to buy insurance on the open market, to gut Medicaid by shifting costs to states and reducing funding, to cut taxes on corporations and wealthy individuals, and to reduce the nation's ability to make needed investments by capping overall levels of federal spending. The plan would not only put the fragile recovery at risk, but it would also undermine economic growth and job creation for years. This budget is impressive in its ability to not only inflict maximum harm on the economy, but to concentrate that harm on those most in need. This will not only cost the economy hundreds of thousands (and perhaps millions) of jobs over the next five years, it will also destroy the social safety net and undermine policies that support the middle class. Two-thirds of the cuts in Ryan's plan, according to the Center for Budget and Policy Priorities, would harm programs like Medicare and Medicaid that help lower-income Americans. None other than Oklahoma Senator Tom Coburn, one of the most conservative Republicans in Congress, admitted this week that Congress will never balance the budget without raising taxes, an argument few Republicans will make and Democrats vacated when the Obama Administration agreed to temporarily extend the Bush tax cuts. Boxed in by the GOP, the Obama administration may have no choice but to cut a bad deal with Boehner in order to avoid another government shutdown. But that doesn't mean Democrats can't aggressively critique Ryan's plan and begin to frame the budget fight on their terms for 2012. Just because Obama kicked off his re-election campaign with a substanceless video doesn't mean he can afford to be MIA on the biggest issue of the day.",

Just days after it looked like the chances of a partial government shutdown of the federal government had grown significantly due to the failure of Democrats and Republicans to compromise on federal spending, Wednesday brought reports that Democrats and Republicans stepped away from the brink. Progress towards an agreement on what the federal government would spend for the remainder of the fiscal year ending  Sept. 30 apparently came as both sides moved significantly toward each other. Republicans who control the House and Democrats who run the Senate, along with the Obama White House, were apparently finding common ground somewhere around $33 billion in spending cuts. Considering that House Republicans started out demanding $61 billion in cuts and Senate Democrats and the White House opened the bidding at a few billion dollars but quickly raised that to $10 billion, negotiations, fitful as they've been, seemed to be bearing fruit. (NPR's Audie Cornish reported on some of that fitfulness in for All Things Considered Wednesday evening.) But it was also clear from reports that for all the progress, no real agreement had actually been struck. One is necessary by next Friday, April 8, to prevent a a partial government shutdown. Vice President Biden sounded upbeat after meeting with Democrats on Capitol Hill Wednesday evening. The Associated Press reported: \"There's no reason why, with all that's going on in the worldand with the state of the economy, that we can't avoid a government shutdown,\" Biden told reporters after a meeting in the Capitol with Senate Democratic leaders. The tentative split-the-difference plan would end up where GOPleaders started last month as they tried to fulfill a campaignpledge to return spending for agencies' daily operations to levelsin place before President Barack Obama took office. Thatcalculation takes into account the fact that the current budgetyear, which began Oct. 1, is about half over. The $33 billion figure, disclosed by a congressional aidefamiliar with the talks and confirmed by Biden, who used ameasuring stick tied to Obama's budget instead of a currentspending freeze. The number is well below the $60 billion-plus in cuts that the House passed last month, but it still represents significant movement by Senate Democrats and the administration after originally backing a freeze at current rates. Besides spending cuts, House Republicans have also demanded the inclusion of some of the policy restrictions called \"riders\" as part of the agreement and there were indications that Democrats would accept some of them. More from the AP: A Democratic lawmaker familiar with discussions between membersof Congress and administration officials said the administrationhas made it clear that some House GOP proposals restricting theEnvironmental Protection Agency's regulatory powers would have tomake it into the final bill. In order to characterize theadministration's position, the lawmaker insisted on anonymitybecause the discussions have been private. But before rank and file Democrats grab their pitchforks and head to Washington, they should know that their leaders aren't folding on riders across the board. The AP again: \"There are certain things we're just not going to do on riders,even if we agree on everything else we're just not going to doit,\"' Biden said. In that category, Democrats insist, is thegreenhouse gas measure and riders crippling implementation ofObama's health care law, cutting Planned Parenthood off of federalsupport. Meanwhile, House Republicans had evidently decided that if a satisfactory agreement with Democrats wasn't reached by April 8, they would take the extraordinary step of voting again on the $61 billion in cuts they already passed this year and, upon passing it the second time, consider it the law. For a party that made strict adherence to the Constitution part of its appeal to Tea Party movement voters in the mid-term election, this approach would seem to have some flaws. That was duly noted by even Senate Republicans. An excerpt from The Hill: The plan was quickly derided by both Democrats and Senate Republicans, however, who responded by offering a civics lesson to their House colleagues. \"My reaction to that is ultimately the whole body including the executive branch has to sign on here or we're just whistling in the wind,\" Sen. Dan Coats (R-Ind.) said. Sen. Lamar Alexander (R-Tenn.) said: \"To be the law of the land, a bill has to pass the Senate and be signed by the president.\" The Wall Street Journal provides a sense of the type of compromises each side was making: If the two parties agree to cuts of about $33 billion from 2010 spending levels, Democrats would be accepting reductions of a magnitude almost unimaginable just two months ago, given that the party initially wanted to fund government operations in the current year at the same level it did in 2010. Cuts of $33 billion would also be far less than House Republicans have approved, and it was unclear that the most fiscally conservative lawmakers would accept the compromise. When House Budget Committee Chairman Paul Ryan (R., Wis.) proposed about $35 billion of cuts earlier this year, conservatives in his caucus rebelled and forced House leaders to rewrite their plan, raising the level of cuts to $61 billion below 2010 levels.",

House Bill 125, also known as the heartbeat  bill, prohibits abortions after the first detectable heartbeat. State legislatures are considering a new wave of abortion restrictions this year.  Some require longer waiting periods to get abortions. Others would direct doctors to show women ultrasounds of fetuses. But critics say new conservative lawmakers are pushing these bills to test the limits. If South Dakota Gov. Dennis Daugaard signs a newly passed bill, women seeking abortions will now have to wait 72 hours after their initial visit to a clinic before having the procedure done in that state. The bill also requires counseling at a crisis pregnancy center. \"We already know that it's an unborn child that's being aborted, and a 72-hour wait time is certainly not too much to consider when you're taking the life of an unborn child,\" says Valerie Johnson, of South Dakota Right to Life. Johnson calls counseling at a crisis pregnancy center \"a free second opinion.\" However, according to Sarah Stoesz of Planned Parenthood of Minnesota, North Dakota and South Dakota, it is not a second opinion because crisis pregnancy centers do not provide unbiased counseling. \"The mission of a crisis pregnancy center is to talk women out of having abortions. That's not the same thing as offering an opinion,\" Stoesz says. Most states require a 24-hour waiting period. Stoesz says a longer period would mean several trips to a clinic, which for some women in this rural state is hours away. Daugaard is expected to sign the bill. At least 20 states have passed laws that require doctors either to offer women ultrasounds or to perform one. Seven others are now considering bills that would mandate the ultrasound. In Texas, the House and Senate have passed two versions of a bill requiring sonograms before women could have abortions. Doctors would also have to offer to show women the image, provide a detailed description, and allow women to hear a heartbeat if one is audible. \"This bill is one of the most invasive bills in the U.S.,\" says Sarah Wheat, who works with Planned Parenthood of Texas. \"And at the end of the day it doesn't make women healthier and it doesn't help prevent the need for abortion.\" Wheat says the bills amount to government intrusion into a private medical decision.  A similar measure that passed in Oklahoma last year is now being challenged in court. \"The time is right, and we have the votes,\" says Elizabeth Graham, who leads the group Texas Right to Life. \"And the language has been streamlined to be really effective and to protect the rights of women when they are in abortion clinics considering an abortion.\" Graham sees the bill as an expansion of the informed consent process and something widely supported by state legislators. Texas Gov. Rick Perry has made the bill a priority and he has promised to sign whatever compromise version is passed. But abortion-rights activists say these bills show a renewed vigor by states to enact more limitations on abortion. They point to Ohio, where lawmakers are debating a bill that would ban abortions if a fetal heartbeat is detected. Ducia Hamm, standing, of the Ashland Care Center in Ohio, testifies on House Bill 125.\n                \n                    \n                    Jay LaPrete/AP\n                    \n                \nhide caption Ducia Hamm, standing, of the Ashland Care Center in Ohio, testifies on House Bill 125. Recently, two pregnant women got ultrasounds before a packed committee hearing room. The images were displayed on a screen as technicians struggled to find the heartbeat of a 9-week-old fetus. \"And again I apologize, but babies do their own thing and they are moving.  So you see that this is an active growing baby. This is not just a blob or something that's just kind of sitting there doing nothing,\" said Ducia Hamm, of the Ashland  Care Center. Abortion-rights activists have called the bill a stunt and say it would amount to an outright ban on abortion. Some suggest newly elected legislators in Ohio and other states just want to test the waters when it comes to abortion. \"This past November, a whole new crop of state legislators came into office, and these legislators tend to be more conservative,\" says Elizabeth Nash of the Guttmacher Institute, which tracks abortion laws. \"And they're not only pushing the envelope on abortion restrictions; they're even taking it further to try new approaches to restricting abortion.\" In Ohio, the state Right to Life group does not support the fetal heartbeat bill. The group says if it passes, it would be overturned in court.  It's likely the measures in both South Dakota and Texas will also face legal challenges.",

Barbara Boxer (D-CA) prepares for another abortion battle. House Republicans formally launch their latest effort to roll back abortion rights this week, and they're aiming squarely for the tax code. On the docket already are two bills: One would make permanent the decades-old \"Hyde amendment,\" which is currently added every year to federal spending bills and bars most federal abortion funding. The other bill seeks to close what abortion opponents say are \"loopholes\" in last year's health overhaul that could permit federal funds to flow for abortions. But even before the first hearing on the measure, a group of Senate Democrats vowed that if either bill passed the GOP-stacked House, it wouldn't get through their chamber. \"We're not going to stand by and watch while reproductive rights are threatened and women's health is jeopardized again in this country,\" said Sen. Patty Murray, D-Wash. \"We are not going back in history.\" Sen. Barbara Boxer, D-Calif., who has been leading the fight for abortion rights in Congress since she was a House member in the 1980s, said the bills do far more than their sponsors are alleging. Not only would the bill that seeks to make permanent the Hyde amendment forbid public funding of abortion, she said, \"it tells women they can't use their private money to purchase insurance that covers a full range of health care. It punishes women and businesses with a tax hike \u2014 a tax hike \u2014 if they wish to keep or buy insurance that covers the full range of reproductive health care.\" That's because, for the first time, the measure seeks to eliminate some of the tax advantages that come with health insurance if that insurance also covers abortion \u2014 tax advantages like being able to buy insurance with pre-tax dollars. That could affect millions of people because most private insurance covers abortion. \"It is overreaching \u2014 an intrusion of the most reprehensible kind,\" said Sen. Richard Blumenthal, D-Conn. But House sponsors, with the strong backing of their leadership, are confident and pushing forward. \"The fact that it is designated as HR 3 speaks volumes the prioritization by Speaker (John) Boehner and Majority Leader (Eric) Cantor,\" said Rep. Chris Smith, R-N.J. Smith is the key sponsor of the bill to write the Hyde language into permanent law. (House leaders give the first handful of bill numbers to measures they want to highlight as legislative priorities.) \"I think it says to the world that we are serious; it is time for a national debate on abortion that has never really occurred,\" Smith said. Democrats in the Senate, however, said the public would rather Congress focus on other things. \"This election was about the economy,\" said Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand, D-N.Y. \"So I do not understand how this Republican Congress can move from that mandate to create jobs \u2014 to create opportunity in this country \u2014 towards how do we undermine women's reproductive health.\" UPDATE: The House GOP officially kicked off their abortion opposition campaign this afternoon: \"This legislation is really about whether the role of America's government is to continue to fund a practice that takes the lives of over one million little Americans every year,\" said Rep. Trent Franks, R-Ariz., chairman of the Judicicary subcommittee overseeing the bill to make the Hyde amendment  permanent at a hearing today. But going after the tax code could cause all kinds of confusion, testified George Washington University law professor Sara Rosenbaum. For example, she said, the IRS would have to make technical decisions about what types of abortions can and can't be covered so it can decide what kind of insurance is eligible for tax deductions and credits. \"We're going to need the Internal Revenue Service to define a rape; potentially a forcible rape, incest; potentially incest involving minors; as opposed to incest not involving minors; physical conditions endangering life, and physical conditions that don't endanger life,\" she said. Stay tuned, there's a lot more debate to come.",

MICHEL MARTIN, host: I'm Michel Martin and this is TELL ME MORE from NPR News. Coming up I'll share some of my thoughts and my weekly Can I Just Tell You? commentary. But, first, you might have seen a recent profile of conservative activist James O'Keefe in the New York Times magazine. O'Keefe has won fame or infamy, depending on your point of view, by catching and videotaping people in organizations he dislikes in unguarded and embarrassing moments. He did this to several Planned Parenthood chapters and to a former executive at NPR earlier this year. But before all that there was ACORN, a once significant grassroots organizing network that was forced to shut its doors after the undercover sting videos, though heavily and misleadingly edited, resulted in a loss of funding and support that crippled the organization. Now the former head of ACORN, Bertha Lewis, has a new organization. It's called the Black Institute. And she's with us now to tell us more about it. Welcome. Thank you so much for joining us. BERTHA LEWIS: Well, thank you for having me, Michel. MARTIN: What is the Black Institute? What do you hope to do? LEWIS: Well, let me tell you. The Black Institute is an action tank - a think tank that takes action. We have one perspective and point of view and that is from the point of view of black people and people of color throughout the U.S. and diaspora. We have two goals: to actually inform public policy and debate, make sure that people of color and black people in this country are counted in their own data, research and polling, rather than being a tab in someone else's poll. Making sure that we are actually training folks. We have three strategies that is research, which is the data, the polling. We also will be doing leadership, which is training and leadership development. And then community. MARTIN: Well, what do you think your organization will do that existing think tanks - I know you're saying it's an action tank - will not do? For example, the Joint Center for Political and Economic Studies. Then there's, like, the Center for American Progress. LEWIS: Sure. MARTIN: And there are groups like that. What do you think you do - will do that these existing groups do not do? LEWIS: First of all, it's the wrong question because it doesn't have to - one is not an either/or situation. Those of us who are progressive, those of us who are on the left need to take a lesson from the right. No one think tank can do all of the research. We need a lot more. We need institutions all over. This is why I think the progressives and the left were so vulnerable to attack because we go, oh, we have one of those. Well, guess what? We need tens and hundreds of those. I want to add to the voices that are progressive. I want to focus on black folks. I want to focus on our sort of new diversity so that all of the sort of intellectual information and the background doesn't just stay stagnant. MARTIN: Tell me more about why you want to have a focus on the black folks per se, given that your previous work was in multiracial coalitions. In fact, ACORN was more about poverty. LEWIS: Right. MARTIN: So it wasn't about race. It was more about low income than it was about race. LEWIS: Exactly. MARTIN: Tell me why you feel that there's a particular need to focus on African-Americans or black folks, as you said, because you're not specifically saying... LEWIS: Black folks. You know, black - I come from a generation where we had to just take that term and wrestle with it and redefine it for ourselves. But I do have to say, for me, coming out of the troubles from 2008 through 2010, it was a very profound experience. We talked a lot about how ACORN was the canary in the mine. We kept trying to tell folks there's a new sort of wave in town. You ought to be conscious of it, because if they come for us in the morning, they're going to come for you at night. And we did organize low and moderate income folks. It just so happens that over our 40 years, period of time, most of those folks - and the reality is - most of those folks that are poor and struggling - the working poor, are people of color. We are becoming, so they say, a majority/minority country. That is, we are going to be a majority black and brown country. And you know what? I'm sick and tired of black folks being sort of an appendage. What is good for black America is good for all of America. MARTIN: I want to pick up on something you just said that you feel that would happen with ACORN if ACORN was like the canary in the coal mine in the sense that what engulfed ACORN was something that other people were going to experience later on. It became true. We experienced it here at NPR. Everyone, I think, is aware of that story and led to the resignations of some top people here. But I want to talk about what you think happened there. For people who don't remember, some employees were caught in an undercover video appearing to advise a couple who were posing as a pimp and a prostitute on how to break several laws and avoid detection, recorded by conservative activist James O'Keefe. And I'll just play a short clip just to refresh people's memories about, you know, what happened here. UNIDENTIFIED MAN: So I can be the one who - I have the documentation, right? So I can be the one - basically put up the house for her and she can perform tricks in the house. UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN: Yup. UNIDENTIFIED MAN: OK. MARTIN: All right. So there were several investigations, probes, by the California attorney general, by the Brooklyn, New York district attorney, including Congress. And it emerged that these videos were heavily edited, that no one had in fact broken the law, that people were not in fact facilitating prostitution, that in fact, and in fact in a number of instances that ACORN employees had called the authorities and had tried to alert the authorities to what they thought was going on. But even having said that, when you look back on it now, did your employees perhaps go too far to be understanding, to look as though that they were, you know, too tolerant? I mean the thing that makes people crazy is to say that, look, I mean, you know, why didn't you just throw the people out? LEWIS: Look, I was, this was like a Thursday or something and someone called and the tapes were coming out like in the next hour. And it's a shock value when you look at it and you say, oh my god, what is going on? You're too dumb to live. You don't have to be somebody's mama and give them counseling about a life. But... MARTIN: So what was that about? LEWIS: But what we did was once you investigate it, you found out that what you hear on the audio actually was spliced together. What you also did not hear and did not see were our folks doing their job, which was saying, here, here is where you can go, young lady, to get help. Here are agencies. And you, young man, here's where you need to go. We can call the police, the community affairs for you right away. And if you really want to get clean and do the right thing, here's your appointment to come back in. So... MARTIN: You're saying he was posing himself as wanting to get clean because that's not how it... LEWIS: Oh, he was straight-laced and... MARTIN: No. No. What we hear on these tapes is him wanting to set up a house of prostitution. LEWIS: I understand. That's what you think you hear, not saying... MARTIN: And so what you're saying is for those who heard those tapes, you're saying that he considered himself wanting to get clean? LEWIS: They were like, oh my god. Oh my god, they're just going along with this. MARTIN: Yeah. LEWIS: And they shouldn't go along with this. And then, first of all, you're making a judgment right away. Again... MARTIN: And you're saying... LEWIS: And I'm going to repeat this again. MARTIN: Yeah. LEWIS: Again, in video what you think you saw did not in fact happen. In audio what you think you hear did not in fact happen. Why would these district attorneys and folks investigating, they actually got the unedited tapes and they actually talked to these women and talked about the context, what was said, when did you say this, how did you say this? And so this is where the conclusion was that no laws were broken because in fact not only were nothing legal, illegal done, but morally what you didn't hear, and if ever we can get these unedited tapes, what you would see is our counselors actually sort of feeling sorry for these folks, saying that's really bad. MARTIN: There were some employees who were fired though. LEWIS: There were employees who were fired immediately and then reinstated. MARTIN: And they were reinstated... LEWIS: Absolutely. Because... MARTIN: Because you're saying after a fuller investigation you found that they.... LEWIS: And this rush to judgment... MARTIN: Mm-hmm. LEWIS: ...on folks, you know, we were all shocked. We were already under relentless attacks and trying to make sure that everything was - in our house was in order. And then for this to happen out of the blue, for me as the CEO at that time, my real concern was that I said, why didn't anybody tell anyone else that, hey, these two white people walked up in the office. (SOUNDBITE OF LAUGHTER) LEWIS: Isn't that unusual? And in the end the counselors were like, we didn't think anything of it because there really wasn't much to it. They weren't there that long. MARTIN: So you kind of rushed to judge for yourself, but then you reinstated... LEWIS: Yeah. Sure. But when you make a mistake, you have to correct it. MARTIN: What's the status of that group now? As we said, that it's defunct. But there are, what, some independent organizations... LEWIS: Not exactly. MARTIN: Yeah, tell me. LEWIS: Let me just say, you know, organizing by any other name is still - can be still as effective. Poor people didn't go away. Black folks certainly didn't go away. And we were already in the process of reorganizing. You know, I had started to institute some reforms. We were making all of these improvements and we were this close to going for the next 40 years. What, you know, what's the new ACORN going to do and to be focused on? And so what some of the states did was they said, you know what? We're going to start over. We want to go deep locally. And so folks reorganized themselves, revamped themselves, created bullet-proof or state organizations because you learned that lesson. MARTIN: With different names. LEWIS: With different names. MARTIN: Nobody is called ACORN anymore? LEWIS: We became - it really was the Scarlet letter, the big A. MARTIN: What do you think you've learned from all this? Because some look at this and say that the model perhaps is no longer relevant to today. What do you think it means? LEWIS: I think that's false. I don't know, you know, what people would be saying that. And I think the people that will be saying that are some of the same people who want poor people to go away. They want black people to go away. They want brown people to go away. They want the working poor to go away. We were attacked because we were effective. And we were attacked because we were the largest organization of poor people in this country and we had power and we actually made change. We worked on the minimum wage for 10 years. We built hundreds of thousands of units of housing. We attacked the privatization of education. And more importantly, our voter registration said to folks in public housing, and entrapped in ghettos, you still count and you can go to the polls to vote for a better wage or better living conditions. It was in between presidential elections, it was those local elections, those I think - those are the people that we pissed off the most. MARTIN: Why were you drawn to this particular work? LEWIS: Well, you know, it's funny... MARTIN: It sounds to me you could've had a great career as a preacher or... LEWIS: Well... (SOUNDBITE OF LAUGHTER) MARTIN: ...any number - lawyer. It sounds like you argue a fair piece. LEWIS: I never  I mean I didn't start out to be an organizer. I came to New York to be in the theater. I ran a small off-off-Broadway theater and turned it into an off-Broadway theater and I thought I would foment revolution through musicals... (SOUNDBITE OF LAUGHTER) LEWIS: ...and that had a message. And I thought through the arts that would be my social activism. But as fate would have it, I moved into a building with some other artists way up in the South Bronx. We got duped into it, had to organically form a tenants association. I became a tenant leader fighting for my home, didn't know anything about it. I left the theater one day and never went back, and it changed my life. This was important to me. And in a way, you know, we could make plans but the creator has something else in mind. And so I think I wound up where I should've been. I certainly wound up in the eye of history. I wouldn't have changed the last couple of years of this right-wing attack for anything. MARTIN: Really. LEWIS: It crystallized things for me. And it crystallized for me that as I move forward, yes, I want to talk about race in particular because I've fought for poor people and low and moderate income people during my 20-some years at ACORN. However, I think people of color, across the board, it is not just poor people that need to be organized. I want to organize and really live the fact that race matters. MARTIN: Bertha Lewis is the former president and CEO of ACORN. That's the nationwide community organizing group. She is now the CEO and founder of a new institute called The Black Institute and she was kind enough to stop by our Washington, D.C. studios. Bertha Lewis, thank you so much for joining us.

            "article_content": "Lawmakers reached a deal on the budget Friday night, and gave themselves most of this week to formally pass it. That  deal, though, is only for the current fiscal year, already half over. The federal deficit is a long-term problem. And this week leaders in both parties press long-term plans, including President Obama, who is expected to speak about his on Wednesday.  STEVE INSKEEP, Host: It's MORNING EDITION from NPR News. I'm Steve Inskeep. RENEE MONTAGNE, Host: Joining us now, as she does most Mondays, is NPR's Cokie Roberts. Good morning. COKIE ROBERTS: Hi, Renee. MONTAGNE: What do lawmakers think of the agreement they reached on Friday? ROBERTS: So they won something, too. Neither side sees much to crow about, however. The president is emphasizing the cooperation that he was able to get between Democrats and Republicans, talking about how this agreement like the one on tax cuts last December. He's mindful, of course, that after those tax cuts, that he went up in the public opinion polls. And so he is touting that cooperation. MONTAGNE: And, as you say, even as the president talks about cooperation, the White House noted that the president was standing firm on money for Planned Parenthood. Why did that become such a big issue? ROBERTS: Well, the president was thinking about independent voters, especially suburban, independent voters who tend to support organizations like Planned Parenthood. Republicans are trying to cut off funding because they say they use the non-federal dollars for abortions and the Republicans are against abortions. But the president, even as he was saying that he was bringing people together, and he was the grown up, as he put it, in this fight, he was hanging tough on something - and it was on that question of funding Planned Parenthood where the White House told reporters that when Speaker Boehner pushed for cutting money for Planned Parenthood, the president just said no. MONTAGNE: And meanwhile, Speaker John Boehner's office produced its own storyline that was somewhat different from the White House's version. ROBERTS: So, in the end, the only really significant policy issues that ended up in this package were some affecting the District of Columbia. One saying it cannot use its own money to fund abortions, and another continuing a voucher program for kids to go to private and parochial schools - something near and dear to Boehner's heart. He worked with then-living Senator, Ted Kennedy, on inner-city Catholic schools here in the District of Columbia, and that was something he cared deeply about. MONTAGNE: So, Cokie, what now? Is there a way to avoid these dramatic countdowns to crisis in the future? I mean, there's some pretty big dramatic issues coming up. ROBERTS: True. I mean, we got to this crisis 'cause the Democrats failed to fund the government when they were supposed to last year, 'cause they didn't want to take those votes before an election. Rough votes coming up now: a debt ceiling that has to be increased - where Republicans have promised Armageddon - and the 2012 budget, which will be voted on in the House this week.

Read Another Opinion On Obama's Campaign Ed Kilgore is a special correspondent for The New Republic. Rebutting the main argument in Doug Schoen and Patrick Caddell's latest travesty of an op-ed column (\"The Hillary Moment,\" in Monday's Wall Street Journal) would be a pretty egregious example of shooting fish in a barrel. Their idea that Barack Obama should abruptly shut down his re-election campaign so that Democrats can run the Secretary of State is both ludicrous and pointless, aside from the fact that neither of these two Fox Democrats comes to the topic in good faith. On the other hand, Schoen and Caddell build their dumb and disingenuous argument on a premise that is accepted in better company than their own: that if Obama wins with a \"negative campaign\" focusing on the extremism of the Republican Party, he will make his second term a shambles, marked only by increased partisanship as insulted conservatives refuse to cooperate with his agenda. But this premise is as equally flawed as the other arguments the duo put forward. Win or lose, the kind of Obama campaign that Schoen and Caddell bemoan may, in fact, be the only way to end the polarization and gridlock and make governing in Washington possible again. To begin, it's far from clear why conservatives would be offended by the claim that they represent a very different governing philosophy than the one put forward by President Obama.  Indeed, it's exactly what they say. Aside from their fatuous claims that the cautious centrist Obama represents something new and dangerously leftist in the Democratic Party, the prevailing conservative belief is that their own party had \"abandoned conservative principles\" up until 2009, and made big gains in 2010 precisely because a previously hidden majority of Americans were mobilized to vote for a Tea Party-influenced GOP that was finally loud, proud, and consistent about its ideology. If conservatives are right about the likely outcome of an election representing a \"choice, not an echo\" (to adopt the title of Phyllis Schlafly's famous book from the Goldwater campaign, which became an abiding slogan of the conservative movement), nothing should please them more than a \"negative\" Obama campaign that calls attention to their party's hard-earned ideological rigor. Besides, we already have an excellent example of a president who ran on a message of bipartisanship \u2014 Obama in 2008 \u2014 and we all saw how well that worked out for him. There's no reason on earth to believe an Obama campaign based on constant appeals to bipartisanship, if successful, would work any better to produce actual bipartisanship than the constant appeals to bipartisanship the president made during his first electoral campaign. In fact, it's reasonably clear in retrospect that one significant source of the current partisan gridlock in Washington is that Obama's 2008 campaign was insufficiently negative to yield the kind of mandate to govern that Republicans (and for that matter, dissident Democrats) could not ignore. Yes, Obama campaigned on a platform that included precisely the kind of major policy initiatives he has tried to implement in office, most notably universal health coverage and a cap-and-trade system for carbon emissions. But in the post-election period, Republicans and many \"neutral\" pundits insisted on dismissing everything Obama had said during the campaign other than his promise to overcome partisan gridlock, interpreted as meeting the GOP at least half-way on every subject regardless of how rapidly they moved to the right. Had Obama spent much of 2008 attacking conservative ideology as inherently misguided and out of line with the views and values of the country, his resounding victory would have discredited the popular conservative idea that a \"center-right nation\" had decided Obama might be a better vehicle for reining in big government than the feckless big-spender Bush or the RINO McCain. That's why, if a second Obama term is to amount to much of anything, it's important that he make the policy choices facing the country as clear as is humanly possible. And yes, that means comparative \u2014 which is by necessity partially negative \u2014 campaigning, rather than some placid demand that voters judge his record in an up-or-down vote that does not take into account the kind of politicians and policies they would thereby elevate to power. And even if he is doomed to lose, he owes it to the country to keep constant pressure on the GOP to make its positive policy agenda as explicit as possible. Under such pressure, it's possible a nominee like Mitt Romney would disappoint the Republican Tea Party base by foreswearing highly destructive courses of action and embracing positions that involve something more than a demand that Democrats unconditionally surrender. Moreover, Obama has a moral obligation to remind voters that the presidential election is not, as a simple matter of fact, a referendum, but a decision for and against two candidates, two parties, two philosophies, two agendas, two prospective Supreme Courts, two prospective foreign policies, two views of economic inequality, two attitudes towards the very wealthy and the very poor, and two concepts of the very purpose of government. Americans unhappy with life in the United States who vote against Obama next November will not simply be registering their unhappiness with the status quo, but will be voting for policies ranging from the abandonment of reproductive rights and progressive taxation to the proposition that anyone rich enough to be regarded as a \"job creator\" should be exempt from accountability to the public for much of anything. Of course, thanks to the obstructive power of minority parties in Washington, a comparative election will not necessarily empower the winners of either the presidential or the congressional elections to govern effectively. But it's far more likely to produce accountability for winners and losers alike, hastening the day when the country is not lurching from one status quo referendum to another with each cycle's losers choosing to deny the winner any sort of mandate. So let's hear it for \"negative campaigning,\" if it offers Americans an opportunity to give Washington some clear direction. ",

MICHEL MARTIN, host: We wanted to spend a few more minutes actually talking about the word slut and we do recognize that many people find it offensive and a slur. And, also, a lot of people thought that that word was actually retired. But it seems to have found a new life of late. MSNBC host Ed Schultz just returned to the air this week after he was suspended for making these remarks on his radio show. ED SCHULTZ: I mean, we're in this severe weather pattern right now. Rain, severe thunderstorms, winds getting whipped up to tornados of horrific proportions. And what are the Republicans thinking about? They're just thinking about how much this is going to cost. Like this right wing slut, what's her name? Laura Ingraham? Yeah, she's a talk slut. MARTIN: We wanted to talk more about this word that can cause an anchor to get booted from the air, but we're also interested in how the young women we just heard are using it. Is it a word to be reclaimed? To get at these questions, we've called on Rebecca Traister, author of \"Big Girls Don't Cry: The Election that Changed Everything for American Women.\" She's thought a lot about these issues and written a lot about them for Salon.com, among other outlets. And she's on the line with us today from Brooklyn, New York. Welcome, Rebecca. Thanks for joining us. REBECCA TRAISTER: Thanks for having me. MARTIN: I wanted to talk a little bit more about - for just a minute about the fact that Ed Schultz was suspended for this. And it was interesting to me that progressive women's groups were among those who were advocating that he be suspended for that. Do you think that that was an appropriate punishment? Explain why you think so. TRAISTER: Well, I think - I don't know if I can speak to how appropriate that particular punishment was. I mean, you've seen a lot of this recently on MSNBC with Keith Olbermann, with Ed Schultz. You've seen some of it on NPR. I mean, we're really in a world in which we're beginning to police the language of the media and offering all different kinds of punishments. And I don't know that any of us can talk about exactly what's appropriate or what works or what speaks to the language crime in question. MARTIN: OK, well, that's fair. But then just talk to me about the word, if you would, too, and the - sort of use of it presently. And I'm interested, too - I think everybody understands that the word has been used - you know, it started out to be one word, and now it's kind of used to kind of shame women around their sexuality, and we get that. I'm interested in, you know, you hear younger African-American women split over the N-word, right... TRAISTER: Yes. MARTIN: ...and some saying, OK, we should be able to use this word if we want to, because this deprives it of its power. And I'm wondering if you feel the same way about the S-word. TRAISTER: Well, it's complicated with the S-word, with slut, because, in fact, slut has always had the same meaning. You know, since the 15th century, slut has meant - has been used as a derogatory and dehumanizing word to describe a certain kind of woman, a woman - and what we're objecting to, here, we're not trying to reclaim the word. It's not as though it was once a neutral word that has - that was perverted, and that we are trying to, you know, reclaim. What activists are objecting to here is actually the idea that that word expresses, a contempt for women, and especially sexually women, and in this particular case, women who dress in a certain way. So it's a very complicated project. And one of the objections to it has come from many women and men of color who say, wait a minute. Reclamation of these words has not exactly worked for us. And there is this discussion over the N-word, and there are some people who feel that reclaiming it, using it conversationally in entertainment, in comedy is a powerful statement. And there are others who say, wait a minute. That hasn't stopped people from deploying it negatively and harmfully against us. And that's one of the arguments that's being used by people of color against the idea behind the SlutWalk, which is that by taking this word and using it, rallying around it, it's not actually going to keep people - whether it's Ed Schultz or whether it's a cop in Toronto - from deploying it against women. MARTIN: What do you think about the movement itself, and what do you think about the use of the term SlutWalk to describe the movement? TRAISTER: Well, I completely applaud the movement. I mean, listening to the interview with Heather and Anna, how can you not? Here are young women - this is - and Jessica Valenti is a feminist activist who pointed this out in The Washington Post: This is one of the most active, vibrant, exciting forms of protest we've seen within a feminist movement in decades. These are grassroots organizers. These are not big organizations that are printing out signs. These are young women who obviously feel very strongly about the way that their sexuality is being policed and discussed, and about - and feel very strongly about victim-blaming at the root of their (unintelligible). And they are coming out in droves. And that is thrilling news for anyone who cares about gender equity and the feminist movement in the United States. I do - there are lots of complicated questions about SlutWalk. Among them, some of the questions raised by men and women of color who say they feel like this is not a movement that embraces them. I think there is a risk in rallying around a word like slut, that you alienate some - and having it be a big part of feminist activism, you have it alienate some women who don't feel that they can relate sexually to that term, whether, you know, by action or by clothing. You alienate some women who come from communities or families or religions or traditions that would have a hard time with them rallying around that word, even if they fundamentally believe in all the ideas that the activism itself is supposed to represent. MARTIN: Well, no, and I think you're making an important point, because the part of the activism is that most of the activism isn't directed at the word. The activism is about the idea that what you wear somehow determines whether you can be assaulted or not. So I think that they were trying to be very clear about that, but the word itself is part of it, since they chose to use it. I came across a blog posting by a woman named Sarah Langford. She's a feminist activist in Australia. She writes: Never mind the word slut. Let's reclaim woman. She writes, women calling one another - she used the B-word, I'm going to - slut or hooker makes light of woman hatred. These words have been, and continue to be used to keep women in their place as less-than-human in a male-dominated society. And she says she thinks a more fruitful project would be reclaiming the word woman. What do you think about that? TRAISTER: Well, I love the idea behind it. And I'm always trying to put women at the center of moral arguments, you know, about politics and reproductive rights and equality. But I would also say that if we were talking about woman walks, well, we probably wouldn't be talking about them right now. There is an electric value to choosing a controversial word. And the fact is, if young women were going around the country staging woman walks right now, they'd be getting much less attention than they are staging SlutWalks. And there's a real value to that. MARTIN: Finally, do you have some thoughts about - is there, given all your ambivalence and that of other people about the word itself, is there a way that you think that the point could be more effectively made about the idea that, you know, what you wear isn't determined whether you are - whether it's OK that you should be free from assault or not? Is there a way that it could be more effective, do you think? TRAISTER: Well, there are a million ways that you can communicate this: conversationally, in writing, in direct communication. The activism, I actually do, for all my ambivalence and qualms about it, the activism is effective in that it's bringing out a lot of people. It's bringing out a lot of attention. It's prompting conversations like this one, where you do elucidate the idea, which is the important part. And the fact is, activism isn't perfect. I mean, you look at a feminist movement that historically has been riven by racial inequalities, a civil rights movement that was riven by gender inequalities. Activism is an imperfect peace. And so this is an imperfect form of activism. But I think it's drawing a lot of attention to the issue. And so while we should be talking about our qualms with it, we should also recognize that we're talking about it, and that, in itself, is effective as a form of public protest. MARTIN: All right.

David Kaufman is a New York-based writer who regularly contributes to the Wall Street Journal, Financial Times, Time and Monocle. Tuesday's Washington Post article examining the response by African-American voters to President Barack Obama's new Defense of Marriage Act policy reveals what many in the black community already know: When it comes to the ballot box, marriage equality is mostly a nonissue. In interviews with black pastors, pollsters, churchgoers and professors, African-American voters explain that economic and social-justice platforms are of far greater concern than LGBT (lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender) issues. Of course there are many African Americans \u2014 particularly the religious \u2014 for whom same-sex marriage will always be anathema. But the message is clear: Even voters who don't support marriage equality still appear willing to elect politicians who do. \"Black voters are well aware that we're dealing with complex issues that are not always a zero-sum game,\" says J. Cameron Carter, associate professor of theology and black church studies at Duke University. \"What this article illustrates is that black voters are as sophisticated as anyone else,\" he adds, \"and it's time the larger LGBT leadership began to recognize it.\" While the Post article suggests this sophistication, its writers fail to give it the attention it deserves. Doing so would have offered not only a more nuanced analysis of DOMA's impact on black voters but also an entirely new take on their relationship with the larger LGBT movement itself. The Misunderstood Black Vote And the Post revisits \u2014 yet again \u2014 the blaming of black churchgoers for the passage of California's Proposition 8 during the 2008 election cycle. Indeed, even before that November vote, prominent white members of the LGBT community vilified religious African Americans for supposedly voting with a stridently anti-LGBT agenda. Indeed, church attendance has been called the main cause of black voters' support for Proposition 8, which banned same-sex marriage. But the truth is actually reversed. Focused far more on job creation, health care and education than on gay marriage, black voters aren't supporting conservative candidates simply because they oppose LGBT rights. Instead, they are voting for progressive pro-LGBT candidates \u2014 despite disagreeing with their pro-LGBT platforms. \"The truth is, we just don't see blacks voting against a candidate based on [his or her] support of gay marriage,\" says Patrick Egan, assistant professor of politics and public policy at New York University. \"We actually don't see this becoming an important issue for voters of any race.\" Nonetheless, African Americans do skew conservative when voting for explicitly anti-LGBT initiatives such as Proposition 8, Egan notes. \"But once you take church attendance into account, the numbers are not all that different\" for blacks and equally religious White voters. In fact, trade the word \"marriage\" for \"civil unions/domestic partnerships,\" and blacks are actually slightly more favorable than the general population toward legal recognition of same-sex relationships, according to a 2009 poll by the Third Way, a centrist-progressive think tank in Washington, D.C. As we shift into the 2012 election cycle, marriage equality is certain to play prominently on both party platforms. On a national level, President Obama's DOMA stance is already under attack by potential Republican candidates such as Sarah Palin and Mike Huckabee. On a state level, the almost certain passage of marriage equality in Maryland this month paves the way for an almost equally certain Proposition 8-styled battle to nullify it on the 2012 ballot. White LGBT Leaders Must Make Room for Black Voices The Maryland situation is particularly important for African Americans \u2014 who make up 31 percent of the state's population, compared with barely seven percent in California. Four years after the \"blame the blacks\" debacle on the West Coast, can LGBT leaders learn from their mistakes and apply the lessons to the East Coast? Will they avoid the race-baiting that has so poisoned their progressive movement since 2008 and led to charges of racism, elitism and indifference to minority matters? The answer remains murky. Already, white LGBT activists such as David Mixner are sending not-so-subtle signals that race will matter in Maryland. \"Our national organizations must immediately line up the unshakable and unmistakable support of President Obama. Voters love him in this state especially in vote-rich Prince George's County and Baltimore,\" he writes in a  Feb. 28 blog posting. With PGC nearly 63 percent African American, Mixner's message could not be clearer \u2014 even if he wimps out on the clarifying. With his history of race-baiting, patronizing tone and zero respect for African-American voter sophistication, Mixner is a dubious messenger. Yet his message cannot be discounted. Race will inevitably play a central role in any Maryland ballot drive \u2014 with blacks the main protagonists. As in Maine's successful 2009 marriage-equality repeal, national white LGBT leaders will undoubtedly \"parachute\" into Maryland to help direct the ballot battle. But this time, black voters \u2014 and leaders \u2014 must take central roles in defining the battle's narrative. This was the case in the successful 2010 campaign to secure marriage equality in Washington, D.C.; pro-LGBT black voices and faces must now be front and center if a similar campaign comes to Maryland. And white LGBT leaders will have to step aside and let this happen. \"One of the reasons the D.C. campaign was so successful is that black voters \u2014 including religious voters \u2014 saw folks like themselves supporting marriage equality,\" explains Lanae Erickson, deputy director of the Culture Initiative at the Third Way. \"Just as important: Many [white] LGBT leaders went out of their way to ensure that these [black] activists were heard.\" Obama and the LGBT Vote As for President Obama's re-election campaign, analysts like Erickson and Egan say that LGBT-voter support is inevitable. \"Blacks and LGBTs historically vote the most Democratic of any demographic,\" Egan explains. But when it comes to gays and lesbians, at least, Obama has certainly earned those ballots. With his new DOMA policy and ending of \"Don't ask, don't tell,\" Obama has fulfilled many of his 2008 campaign promises. Yes, he still does not support full marriage equality, but there is every likelihood that he will do so during his second term. Members of the LGBT community seeking to \"punish\" the president for this act of realpolitik will only end up punishing themselves. \"Take a look at what's happening with women's reproductive rights, and it's very clear things could get a lot worse \u2014 very fast,\" says Duke University's Carter. \"Yes, Obama's LGBT record is not perfect, but it would be delusional to think nothing has happened just because every battle has not yet been won.\" Still, as the experiences in both California and Washington, D.C., suggest, the most important change agents for black voters \u2014 gay or straight, religious or secular, urban or suburban \u2014 are black voters themselves. Stick to the sidelines, as in California in 2008, and risk being demonized by a disappointed white LGBT leadership. But claim the mantle that is rightfully yours, as in Washington, D.C., and lead the struggle for a more equitable nation for every citizen. \"The 2012 election is an opportunity for the black leadership, especially the black LGBT leadership, to stand up and take decisive roles,\" says Thomas Allen Harris, whose new film, Marriage Equality: Byron Rushing and the Fight for Fairness, explores the links between the African-American and LGBT civil rights movements. \"If there's anything we've learned from President Obama, [it's that] politics can truly be a transformative experience.\"",

            "article_content": "President Obama releases his plan to bring down the federal deficit on Monday. He will outline his plan to a congressional panel tasked with cutting more than $1 trillion in red ink.The proposal is expected to include new taxes, Medicare reductions and savings from troop withdrawals.  STEVE INSKEEP, Host: It's MORNING EDITION from NPR News. Good morning, I'm Steve Inskeep. DAVID GREENE, Host: NPR White House correspondent Scott Horsley joins us on the line with more. Hey, Scott. SCOTT HORSLEY: Good to be with you, David. GREENE: So $1.2 trillion in deficit reduction, and that's the minimum target for this committee. How big is the president likely to go this morning? HORSLEY: But this is also about economics. The $1.2 trillion that the supercommittee has to find just doesn't really begin to address the nation's deficit problem. Standard Poor's said earlier this summer that you need at least 4 trillion in deficit reduction. That's what most of the bipartisan groups have also come up with, and so that's where the president is headed. GREENE: Well, as the president addresses this problem, the White House is saying that his vision is going to be balanced. What does that mean? I mean, is that a code for tax increases? HORSLEY: It's an article of faith with the GOP that higher tax revenue kills jobs. And I say article of faith because the evidence from the 1990s is that you can actually have very robust job growth with higher tax rates than we have right now right now. GREENE: You mentioned higher taxes on the wealthy. And we heard over the weekend about one of the president's proposals, a higher tax on the really wealthy. He's actually naming it for billionaire investor Warren Buffett - the Buffett Rule. What is that, exactly? HORSLEY: Yeah. Well, Warren Buffett made waves a few weeks ago when he said that Congress should stop coddling billionaires like him, and... GREENE: Tax me more. Tax me more. HORSLEY: Exactly. And he's complained before that he pays a lower tax rate, for example, than his secretary. Now, a lot of Warren Buffett's income comes in the form of dividends and capital gains, which we do tax at a lower rate than ordinary income. And so the president will call for changing that, at least when it comes to upper-income households. GREENE: Well... HORSLEY: And this makes for a sort of interesting debate about, you know, whether we should tax earnings on money at a different rate than we tax earnings on labor. But I have to say, David, this is a little bit like the corporate jet tax - it's sort of a populist window dressing. The fact of the matter is, there are just aren't enough Warren Buffetts out there to make a huge difference... GREENE: To make a big difference. Well, wasn't there, a few months ago, talk of this grand bargain that would include both increased tax revenue but also significant savings on entitlement programs, like Medicare? I mean, what are the chances for such a grand bargain now? HORSLEY: Last week, we had some 36 senators come out and show support for something like a grand bargain. But of course, it takes more than that to pass anything. If the left digs in and says you can't touch Medicare, if the right digs in and says you can't raise taxes - well, then we're not going to get that kind of grand bargain. And it's going to be a very long and unproductive 14 months until the next election. GREENE: That's NPR's White House correspondent Scott Horsley. Thank you, Scott. HORSLEY: My pleasure.

            "article_content": "President Obama this morning outlines a deficit-reduction plan that his economists say would reduce anticipated federal budget deficits by about $4 trillion over the next decade. President Obama last week.\n                \n                    \n                    Jim Watson/AFP/Getty Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption President Obama last week. As NPR's Scott Horsley said earlier today on Morning Edition, the president and his aides will make the case that he's put together a \"balanced\" plan of cuts in expected spending and increases in tax revenues. \"Balanced,\" says Scott, is a code word for a plan that includes tax increases \u2014 in this case, on the wealthy. The president is due to officially unveil the plan at 10:30 a.m. ET. As we wait for him to speak, here are five things to know about what he's going to propose: 1 \u2014 Which Is It? $4 Trillion Or $3 Trillion? As they report about what the president's going to say, some news outlets are saying the president will have a plan for saving $4 trillion over the next decade, while others are saying it's a $3 trillion package. Which is it? Both (sort of). Officially, the president's statement will be about what he's recommending to the Joint Committee on Deficit Reduction \u2014 the bi-partisan \"super committee\" of senators and representatives. It's been charged with finding $1.2 trillion in additional budget savings (above the $1 trillion agreed to last month) over the next decade. As Scott reported, most economists say that $1.2 trillion just isn't enough to make serious progress toward getting the government's accounts in order. So, the president is going to pitch a plan that he says includes and expands on the $1 trillion that's already been agreed to, and adds up to just more than $4 trillion. 2 \u2014 Increased Tax Revenues (Translation: Higher Taxes) Account For About Half: If you look at the $3 trillion in projected deficit reduction that the president says his plan would achieve over the next decade (above and beyond the $1 trillion already agreed to), then about $1.5 trillion is expected to come from higher taxes. The president proposes: Repealing the so-called Bush tax cuts for couples making more than $250,000 a year. A \"Buffett rule\" that would, as Bloomberg News writes, \"require taxpayers with [annual] incomes of $1 million or more pay at least the same  percentage in taxes as middle-income Americans.\" It gets its name from billionaire investment whiz Warren Buffett, who has said he and other super-wealthy folks should pay more in taxes. 3 \u2014 What About \"Entitlements?\" \"The plan includes no changes in Social Security and does not include an  increase in the Medicare eligibility age, which the president had considered  this summer,\" The Associated Press reports. 4 \u2014 The Cuts: According to senior administration officials, the AP says, the plan includes \"nearly $250 billion in reductions in Medicare spending, $330 billion in cuts in  other mandatory benefit programs, and savings of $1 trillion from the withdrawal  of troops from Iraq and Afghanistan.\" 5 \u2014 Its Chances: Lawmakers just went through a bruising political battle over the deficit and the government nearly went into default as they argued over what to do. What are the chances that this plan \u2014 something of a \"grand bargain\" that could anger liberals and conservatives \u2014 will fare any better? \"If the left digs in and says you can't touch Medicare\" and other entitlement programs and \"the right digs in and says you can't raise taxes ... it's going to be a long and unproductive 14 months\" between now and the November 2012 elections, Scott says.",

Read An Excerpt In 2007, Bill Moyers returned to PBS to revive his long-running public affairs program, Bill Moyers Journal, which first aired on PBS in the '70s. Moyers' show drew a loyal audience to its coverage of politics, public controversy and the arts before his retirement in 2010. In a new book, the longtime PBS host and former aide to President Lyndon B. Johnson recaptures the show's memorable interviews, from The Wire's David Simon to conservationist Jane Goodall to Chicago minister Jeremiah Wright. Moyers launched his program's revival with an interview with Jon Stewart, the Comedy Central host who satirizes the news business to which Moyers is so devoted. It wasn't the most obvious choice, but Moyers tells NPR's Neal Conan that Stewart was his second choice after Mark Twain \u2014 and he wasn't available. \"I think Stewart is the closest we've come in a long time to Mark Twain,\" Moyers says. \"Both of them understood a very important point about American politics, which is that the truth goes down easier if it's marinated in humor.\" Moyers describes Stewart's interview as an enjoyable mental exercise, but they weren't all that way. \"The worst interview I ever did in my career ... was with Henry Kissinger,\" Moyers says. \"I could not get him to say one thing that was close to candid.\" The White House Years For seven years, Moyers worked under Presidents Kennedy's and Johnson's Democratic administrations. He says some believe his time in government must have led to an inherent bias; but over the course of his 40-year public television career, he says, he realized that what matters is \"not how close a journalist gets to power, but how close a journalist gets to the truth.\" Despite his early start in politics, Moyers says he wasn't tempted to run for office. \"I was too embedded in journalism,\" he says. \"I was only by accident \u2014 by coincidence \u2014 in the White House,\" says Moyers, who spent two years as Johnson's press secretary, where, he says, \"our credibility was so bad we couldn't believe our own leaks.\" And after fielding a particularly tough question from a reporter, he says he remembers thinking, \"I don't belong on this side of this briefing. I belong on the other side, asking questions.\" Then and there, he decided to leave government, a decision that led to a long and distinguished career in journalism.

Gingrich was in the middle of those debates, fiery in his rhetoric, yet willing to compromise and work with a Democratic president. The 104th Congress The election of 1994 was a watershed moment in U.S. politics. For the first time in four decades, Republicans won a majority in the House of Representatives. Leading the charge was Gingrich, a former history professor. He emerged from the back benches of the House, gaining a reputation as a rhetorical flamethrower, using words like \"corrupt\" and \"pathetic\" to denounce his Democratic opponents and the failings of what he tirelessly dismissed as the liberal welfare state. I did burn out my party. There's no question [that] by the spring of 1998, they were just tired, and they didn't want to fight anymore, and they didn't want to have any new ideas \u2014 I actually had a senator say to me, 'We're not doing any ideas this year.' Newt Gingrich \"I would insist that it is impossible to maintain American civilization with 12-year-olds having babies, 15-year-olds killing each other, 17-year-olds dying of AIDS, and 18-year-olds getting diplomas they can't even read,\" he said at the time. As speaker, Gingrich led House Republicans through the planks in the \"Contract with America,\" a campaign document many GOP candidates used as a template in the 1994 election. Among other things, it called for passage of a balanced-budget amendment to the Constitution, term limits and streamlining the operations of the House. Few of the provisions made it into law. But working with President Clinton, Congress reformed welfare and enacted a balanced budget. \"The kind of speaker that he was, was one that was willing to be a consensus builder,\" says James Thurber, director of the Center for Congressional and Presidential Studies at American University. \"He worked with Clinton. He was a person who got a lot accomplished with the president \u2014 the balanced budget, for the first time since 1969; the 100,000 cops bill; welfare reform; and a variety of other things.\" \"We can make an honest, legitimate claim that this is the most significant Congress in a generation,\" said Gingrich, \"and you have to go back to Lyndon Johnson's 1965-66 efforts to see a comparable scale of change.\" A 'Split Political Personality' But while Gingrich was working with the president on policy, he was working against him politically. House Republicans relentlessly pursued impeachment charges against Clinton for lying to a grand jury over his affair with Monica Lewinsky. \"The impeachment shows the split political personality of Newt Gingrich,\" says Jack Pitney, a political science professor at Claremont McKenna College.

So you have Gingrich the healer, Gingrich the hollerer, Gingrich the thoughtful bipartisan and statesman, and Gingrich the hard-charging partisan.\" Gingrich also misstepped. In 1997, he was fined $300,000 for violating House ethics rules relating to a course he taught. He issued an apology on the House floor, acknowledging that his critics might have been right. \"To the degree I was too brash, too self-confident or too pushy, I apologize. To whatever degree in any way that I brought controversy or inappropriate attention to the House, I apologize,\" he said. After the 1998 election, in which House Republicans unexpectedly lost seats, Gingrich could see the political writing on the wall. He had already survived an attempted coup by his Republican colleagues. Shortly after the November election, he announced he would relinquish the speaker's gavel and resign from Congress. Campaigning in Iowa this week, Gingrich was asked about his years as speaker. \"If you look at the totality of what we accomplished, I had a pretty good speakership. I'd rather have done that than been a caretaker,\" he said. \"I did burn out my party. There's no question [that] by the spring of 1998, they were just tired, and they didn't want to fight anymore, and they didn't want to have any new ideas \u2014 I actually had a senator say to me, 'We're not doing any ideas this year.' \" Gingrich is still full of ideas and sounds very much the history professor on the stump. In fact, says American University's Thurber, he has much in common with the man he'd like to replace in the White House. \"He may be very similar to President Obama, in the sense that President Obama at times sounds like the professor president, and certainly Newt does \u2014 he loves to give long, complex answers and really lectures on issues,\" Thurber says. It's impossible to predict what kind of president Gingrich would make, but if his speakership is any guide, it seems safe to assume a Gingrich White House would be one of bold ideas and polarizing politics.",
