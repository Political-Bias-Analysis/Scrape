            "article_content": "Immigration reform has risen to the top of the list of priorities for many Latino voters, who are now wondering what a Republican-controlled Congress means for the immigration reform debate.  MELISSA BLOCK, HOST: The dramatic change in the makeup of Congress could have major implications for immigration reform. President Obama acknowledged that at the White House today and said he would welcome Republican cooperation on the issue. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) PRESIDENT BARACK OBAMA: I have consistently said that it is my profound preference and interest to see Congress act on a comprehensive immigration reform bill. BLOCK: But the lack of White House action on immigration is pointed to as one of the reasons why Democrats failed to turn out their base yesterday. Hansi Lo Wang of NPR's code switch team reports. HANSI LO WANG, BYLINE: This summer, President Obama stepped away from his pledge to take executive action on immigration, a delay Democrats in red states believed would help them survive in the Senate. But most of those vulnerable Democrats fell last night. And Cristina Jimenez, managing director of United We Dream which advocates for young immigrants, says this strategy backfired. CRISTINA JIMENEZ: The president's decision to delay right before going into the midterm elections definitely made it a lot harder for Latinos to feel like they will want to engage. WANG: And early exit polls show she may have a point. Hispanics made up 8 percent of voters this year. Compare that to 10 percent in 2012. Midterm voter turnout is usually low, particularly for voters of color, but this issue may have played a role for Latino voters. SYLVIA MANZANO: Immigration has been either the top priority or the second-ranked priority over, at least, the last four years. WANG: That's Sylvia Manzano of the polling group Latino Decisions. Their survey this week found that 45 percent of Latino voters ranked immigration reform above jobs, education reform and healthcare. MANZANO: You know, in places where you have very large U.S.-born, native-born proportions of the Latino electorate, they're not immigrants themselves and yet there is an increasing urgency about this issue. WANG: President Obama says he's looking for bipartisan solutions, yet he's still holding on to the possibility of taking executive action. But Mark Krikorian, executive director of the Center for Immigration Studies which favors stricter immigration laws, says there would be political consequences. MARK KRIKORIAN: It would unite the Republicans against him even more than they are now. And there would be serious attempts to use the power of the purse to defund whatever it is that he announces. WANG: Krikorian says that doesn't mean Republicans can ignore the concerns of Latinos. KRIKORIAN: The challenge is how do they attract Hispanic voters without alienating their own Republican base? WANG: One way, says Ali Noorani, executive director of the National Immigration Forum, an immigrant advocacy group, is for Republicans to take the reins on the issue. ALI NOORANI: There will be an immigration debate in the next Congress, and the success of that debate will be determined by Republicans. You know, they can claim credit for not only fixing the immigration system, but solving the gridlock that's overcome D.C. WANG: In the meantime, it's a game of wait-and-see in Washington. And Cristina Jimenez of United We Dream says we'll see who wins that game in 2016. JIMENEZ: We know that both parties need the Latino vote if they want to gain the White House. And the message that we are sending is that you don't have the support of the Latino and immigrant community yet. WANG: And the countdown has already begun. Hansi Lo Wang, NPR News.

In southwest Denver, a wave of immigrants from Mexico and El Salvador has settled in the neighborhoods around the intersection of Federal Boulevard and Alameda Avenue. Billboards are in Spanish. Chile stands, taquerias and Asian noodle houses line the streets. In a small office plaza across from a carniceria, a group of Latino activists are staging a press conference to roll out their Immigration Voter Accountability Project. As the TV cameras begin to roll, they chant \"Families united, not divided\" and wave signs with similar slogans. A few minutes later, Sonia Marquez, of the Colorado Immigrant Rights Coalition, steps to the small podium and announces their project's main target: Republican congressman and U.S. Senate candidate Cory Gardner. \"All we have received was votes to deport DREAMers, no leadership, no action, no solutions,\" she said. The scene could have been a flashback to 2012, or even 2010 \u2014 two recent elections when courting the Latino vote was a key strategy for Democrats here. This year, Democrats are again trying to make immigration a key issue in a tight U.S. Senate race between incumbent Democrat Mark Udall and his challenger, Rep. Gardner. But they're worried about turnout. It's a perennial problem during midterm elections. So Marquez and other clipboard-carrying foot soldiers are starting to hit the streets in neighborhoods like this. She says the plan is to make direct contact with 45,000 Latinos who voted in the last presidential election but stayed home during the last midterm. \"To you, Congressman Gardner, we are big, we are bad, we are organized, we are ready to go,\" Marquez said. Immigration Politics On the campaign trail, immigration isn't exactly the first issue Gardner wants to talk about. He'd rather focus on job growth and parts of the state that aren't seeing the boom times enjoyed by cities like Denver. But in an interview, he told NPR he's frustrated that more immigration reform measures haven't reached the House floor. And he shrugged off the accusations levied by some Latino groups. \"It's a shame that some people are focused on politics instead of solutions,\" Gardner said. \"I have been focused on solutions in the House from the get-go, and will continue to fight for immigration reform.\" For Gardner, immigration reform means a guest worker program combined with more border security. He stops short at saying he supports a path to citizenship. But lately he has softened his language on immigration and distanced himself from the more hard-line Republicans in the House. Frankly, he has no choice. No longer is he running for a safe Republican House seat in northeast Colorado. This is a statewide race in a state that's been trending blue in recent years, due in part to changing demographics and urbanization. \"I'm not afraid to buck the party,\" Gardner said. \"I'm not afraid to do the right thing when I believe somebody else is doing the wrong thing.\" Gardner recently broke Republican ranks and voted against a bill to repeal the President's Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program. For his part, Sen. Udall says Gardner's \"evolution\" is politically convenient. \"There are a lot of people that think Congressman Gardner's positions haven't changed but his ambitions have,\" Udall told NPR. The Udall campaign likes to point to Gardner's voting record as a state lawmaker here, and his consistent hard-line stance on illegal immigration \u2014 even as he represented a farming area that's heavily dependent on immigrant labor. Immigration has long been a lightning rod issue in Colorado politics. And as Udall has made it an issue once again in this race, he's been forced to explain a vote he made as a congressman eight years ago. It was in favor of a bill that made it a federal crime to be in the country illegally. \"It was 90 percent the implementation of the 9/11 Commission's recommendations to keep our country safe,\" Udall said. \"I did share my concerns about a couple of provisions, but I'm very clear that I thought that was what we needed to do at that time.\" Pocketbook Concerns Still, the Udall campaign maintains that a strong Latino turnout plays heavily in their favor. Recent elections back this up. But in a race where most polls show Udall with a razor-thin lead, no one's taking anything for granted. And for their part, Republicans are looking to make inroads in more traditional Democratic strongholds. Just take the story of state Sen. George Rivera in heavily Hispanic Pueblo, about two hours south, but seemingly worlds apart, from booming Denver. On a recent afternoon, Rivera was going door to door in a tough neighborhood near where he grew up, campaigning for his re-election and for Republicans in statewide races. \"We point out to them who we are as Republicans, and why our values tend to blend with that of the Hispanic culture,\" he said. Last summer, Rivera ousted a Democrat in a high-profile recall election that centered on guns. He says Republicans like Cory Gardner can make inroads with Colorado's fourth- and fifth-generation Latino communities \u2014 by stressing their conservative values. Immigration, he says, doesn't have to be the deal-breaker. It doesn't come up that much when he talks to local voters. \"Right now, the bottom line is people are concerned about what hits their pocketbooks,\" Rivera said. To that end, the state GOP has hired several Hispanic outreach coordinators to help candidates like Gardner. A similar effort fell largely flat here during the 2012 presidential election. This year's success \u2014 or failure \u2014 may depend more on Democratic turnout and whether Udall can keep immigration in the spotlight.",

On January 6th, Republicans will take over both chambers for the 114th Congress. The 114th Congress convenes on Jan. 6 and GOP leaders are preparing their to-do list for the new year, when they will control both chambers. The November elections were a victory for Senate and House Republicans and the change in Congressional leadership will mean a new legislative landscape for President Obama, who entered the White House with a Democratic majority behind him. First on the list, according to incoming Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, will be the Keystone XL oil pipeline. NPR's Ailsa Chang reported Monday on the tone of that first legislative action. \"It will kind of be the first test for McConnell to see if he holds true to his promise that he'll let both Republicans and Democrats propose amendments to shape bills. He's said he would on Keystone, even contentious amendments.\" The most-watched issues going forward will likely be immigration reform and Obamacare. McConnell has promised a vote to repeal the Obama Administration's health care law, telling Roll Call that it was \"a very big issue in the election.\" As for immigration reform, a big sore spot for Republicans who were angered by the President's recent executive action, USA Today referred to it as one of the \"tough sell\" actions for a GOP-led Congress, calling the issue \"politically flammable.\" \"Republicans are searching for a response that will appease hard-charging conservatives who want the GOP to block the president's action \u2014 but that doesn't alienate the fast-growing, politically powerful Hispanic population.\" Last week, NPR's Tamara Keith examined the coming year in Congress and how it might signal a change in the President's political tactics. \"As viewed from the left, President Obama agreed to water down every major piece of legislation in those first two years to keep moderate Democrats on board and unsuccessfully trying to get Republican support. The great, new era of bipartisanship never arrived. Six years and two wave elections later, the big Democratic majorities in Congress are gone. Republicans are about to hold more House seats in the 114th Congress than they have since the 1920s. Oh, and they've taken back the majority in the Senate, as well. Will this change President Obama's approach to governing?\" Maybe. NPR's Steve Inskeep sat down with the President before he left Washington for the holidays. Mr. Obama said he was prepared to use his veto power more often but is optimistic for a productive year with the GOP leadership. \"What I've said repeatedly is that I want to work with them; I want to get things done. I don't have another election to run. There are going to be areas where we agree and I'm going to be as aggressive as I can be in getting legislation passed that I think help move the economy forward and help middle-class families. There are going to be some areas where we disagree and, you know, I haven't used the veto pen very often since I've been in office, partly because legislation that I objected to was typically blocked in the Senate even after the House took over \u2014 Republicans took over the House. Now I suspect there are going to be some times where I've got to pull that pen out. And I'm going to defend gains that we've made in health care; I'm going to defend gains that we've made on environment and clean air and clean water. But what I'm hopeful about \u2014 and we saw this so far at least in the lame duck \u2014 is a recognition by both Speaker Boehner and Mitch McConnell that people are looking to them to get things done and that the fact that we disagree on one thing shouldn't prohibit us from getting progress on the areas where there's some overlap.\" A deadline is already approaching on February 27th, when the Department of Homeland Security will run out of funding. That deadline was specially planned by Republicans in order to quickly revisit immigration reform once the GOP took control of Congress.",

In California's rural Central Valley, a candidate's identity means everything in politics. Just take the race between first-term Republican Rep. David Valadao and Democrat Amanda Renteria for the state's 21st Congressional District seat, which is attracting some unusual attention this fall. In a midterm election year where immigration remains a thorny subject, both Valadao and Renteria talk openly about the need for Congress to pass the stalled comprehensive reform bill. At a debate in Bakersfield this week, Valadao pointed out that he was one of only three Republicans to sign on to the House immigration overhaul bill \u2014 H.R. 15 \u2014 backed by Democrats. \"I've gotten beat up from my own side for it, [but] I think it's very important to get it done,\" Valadao said. \"My parents are immigrants; I learned so much about why it's important to have real opportunities and I think that's what made this country great.\" Republican Rep. David Valadao speaks openly about the need for Congress to pass the stalled immigration reform bill, as does opponent Renteria.\n                \n                    \n                    Rich Pedroncelli/AP\n                    \n                \nhide caption Republican Rep. David Valadao speaks openly about the need for Congress to pass the stalled immigration reform bill, as does opponent Renteria. Valadao, 37, is a dairy farmer of Portuguese descent but speaks Spanish regularly \u2014 the two candidates are also debating in Spanish. On the campaign trail, Amanda Renteria, 39, talks often about her parents, who were migrant farmworkers in the Central Valley. She was the first in her high school to go to Stanford, and she later became the first Latina chief of staff in Congress (for Michigan Sen. Debbie Stabenow). \"They know where I come from; they know my dad was from Zacatecas, Mexico, and himself came with no papers at the beginning,\" Renteria says. \"I think anyone that hears me talk about immigration reform knows my deep passion for it, and this isn't just about election time.\" At times, both candidates seem to be trying to one-up the other on whose ties are stronger to the Central Valley and farming. The newly redrawn district is more than 70 percent Hispanic, and this being farm country, the contest highlights how the politics of immigration aren't as simple as they may seem. Many farmers and big agricultural companies here that tend to lean Republican are in a full-court press lobbying Congress to pass the stalled immigration bill. It's one of the reasons Valadao is seen as a clear front-runner even in a district where Democrats outnumber Republicans. California State University, Bakersfield political scientist Stanley Clark says Valadao is likely \"ethnic enough\" for many voters here, in particular Hispanic men who may typically lean Democrat. Most Hispanic families in this rural valley work in farming, he says. And with the drought, fields are being fallowed and jobs are being cut. Clark says voters are looking for someone who seems like one of them. \"The clearer your association is with [agriculture], the more you are advantaged with them by comparison to somebody whose association with agriculture is more remote and vague,\" Clark says. Renteria is quick to deflect criticism from the Valadao campaign that she's a carpetbagger who just moved back to the Valley a year ago with the express purpose of running for this new seat. \"When it comes to the Latino community here, they've really gotten to know me over this election,\" she says. \"No one wonders whether or not I'm going to keep my promises.\" Now that the national party has begun pulling its money from the race, though, some Democrats say 2014 may be more about the underdog Renteria reintroducing herself to Latino voters here, so she can run again in 2016.",

Next week marks the second anniversary of the start of the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program. It allows young immigrants \u2014 those who were brought to the U.S. illegally before turning 16 \u2014 to avoid deportation and get a work permit for two years. But the program is not being used as widely as you might expect. Forty-five percent of the estimated 1.2 million immigrants who were eligible when the program launched have not applied, according to a new report released Wednesday by the nonpartisan Migration Policy Institute. (It also released a map showing DACA-eligible populations by state.) \"I think you can look at it as a glass half full or a glass less than half full,\" says the think tank's president Michael Fix. Since 2012, according to the report, more than 580,000 unauthorized immigrants have been accepted into the DACA program, which requires applicants to have been under the age of 31 on June 15, 2012, when President Obama first announced the program. They also have to be at least 15 years old and either enrolled in school, a high school degree holder, or an honorably discharged veteran. So far, recipients are mainly female and from Mexico, Central America and Peru. High Fees And Low Awareness Claudia Flores, a 23-year-old immigrant from Honduras, received DACA two years ago and says she's been living in a legal limbo ever since. \"People ask you, 'You're not here legally, or you don't have a legal status, yet you have a Social Security number?'\" says Flores, who also has a work permit now and peace of mind, knowing that she can \u2014 at least temporarily \u2014 avoid deportation. She was 14 when she flew to the U.S. from Honduras with her family, whose visas all expired. Now working as an immigrant rights advocate in Washington, D.C., Flores says with DACA, she can be more open about who she is. \"You exist because you have a piece of paper that identifies you, and that's something that maybe if you were born in this country you might not appreciate the same way,\" she explains. There have been extensive efforts by the government and nonprofits to reach all eligible immigrants like Flores. But Fix says many simply are not signing up. \"You wouldn't apply for it if you didn't know about it,\" he explains. \"You wouldn't apply for it if you couldn't afford the fees.\" It costs $465 to apply each time \u2014 fees that were too high for 17-year-old Jocelyn Lopez, who has been eligible for two years. \"I am a twin, and it's two of us. And financially, my parents didn't have the money to pay for both of our DACA's,\" says Jocelyn, who was three years old when she crossed the U.S.-Mexican border illegally with her family. They now live outside Los Angeles, where Jocelyn's father works in construction. Her mother was laid off from her factory job earlier this year. So, Jocelyn says, it wasn't until the Mexican Consulate offered to pay for their application fees that she and her twin sister could afford to apply for DACA in June. \"I'm actually pretty excited because I can start working and paying for my own stuff,\" she says. \"It's another step for me becoming more independent and not relying on my parents that much.\" Taking The Risk Relying on DACA for deportation relief was always meant to be temporary. When President Obama announced his creation of the program through an executive directive in 2012, he described it as \"not a permanent fix\" and \"a temporary stopgap measure.\" \"There was much more hope when DACA was announced that immigration reform was going to happen,\" says Audrey Singer, an immigration policy expert at the Brookings Institution. That hope has waned as Congress remained deadlocked over immigration and midterm elections draw nearer. Singer says it raises serious questions among potential DACA applicants: \"If I apply and the program goes away, what happens? Will I be deported? Will I put my family at risk?\" \"Our names are on the record, so anything could happen,\" says Monty, a 31-year-old immigrant from Indonesia who asked NPR not to use his last name because he fears deportation if the DACA program ends. \"We could be sent back to our countries. It is a risk.\" He flew to the U.S. from Jakarta at age six with his mother and siblings, whose visas all expired. Two years ago, he applied for DACA with help from Public Counsel, a pro bono law firm based in California. With DACA, Monty can stay in America while President Obama keeps his executive directive in place. And that's a risk, he says, that's worth taking.",

Friday's press conference, on the last day of the retreat, was canceled. House Republicans headed back to Washington on Friday from a resort along the frozen waters of the Chesapeake Bay. They were there for a three-day retreat aimed at mapping out a legislative strategy for this midterm election year. One of the most pressing issues they face is the need next month for Congress to raise the nation's debt limit. GOP lawmakers seem leery of another debt ceiling showdown, and their leaders are pushing to act on immigration this year. Lest there were any appetite among House Republicans for tacking a list of demands onto a raise in the statutory borrowing limit, Speaker John Boehner made clear at the GOP retreat that this time, threatening default was not in his playbook. \"We know what the obstacles are that we face,\" Boehner said, \"but listen: we believe that defaulting on our debt is the wrong thing. We don't want to do that.\" That marked a stark departure from what became known three years ago as \"the Boehner rule,\" which was the speaker's insistence that a dollar be cut from the federal budget for every dollar the debt ceiling is raised. That rule prevailed in a debt ceiling deal three years ago, when huge deficits loomed. But deficits are no longer the talk of Washington, and President Obama says this time, he wants the debt ceiling raised with no conditions attached. Ways and Means Committee Chairman Rep. Dave Camp of Michigan acknowledged the weak hand his party is playing this time. \"The debt's going up, and we have I think a greater obligation than simply just to pass it along,\" Camp said. \"But there is a political reality that the administration, and particularly the president, doesn't see it that way.\" Even debt hard-liners seem ready to toss in the towel. \"I think we'd be glad to set terms, but as we saw through the shutdown, they were not interested in talking about anything,\" said Rep. Marlin Stutzman of northern Indiana, who has Tea Party ties. Meanwhile, House Republicans were presented at the retreat with a two-page list of principles their leaders say will shape a long-awaited immigration bill. Heading the list is tougher border enforcement, something immigration overhaul skeptics have been demanding and which Boehner endorsed. \"You can't begin the process of immigration reform without securing our borders, and the ability to enforce our laws,\" Boehner said. \"Everyone in our conference understands that's the first step in terms of meaningful reform of this problem.\" Unlike the sweeping immigration bill the Senate passed last year, there is no path to citizenship for unauthorized immigrants laid out in the House GOP principles. Only those brought by their parents might acquire expedited citizenship under the House plan. Wisconsin Rep. Paul Ryan is a leading voice in the House GOP on immigration. \"I do not think you should have a special path to citizenship for the undocumented immigrant. I've been pretty clear about that,\" Ryan said. \"This is why we're not going to take the Senate bill and we're not going to engage in a process that could result in the Senate bill.\" The principles do call for giving legal status to unauthorized immigrants who meet a series of conditions. That strikes Illinois Rep. Adam Kinzinger as problematic. \"If you legalize somebody without a pathway to citizenship, you're creating, in essence, a class of people that have no chance of becoming citizens,\" Kinzinger said. But many House Republicans don't even want legalization of those immigrants. One of them is North Carolina Rep. Patrick McHenry. \"Those that willfully broke the law should not be allowed to just continue to break the law,\" McHenry said. \"So for me, as matter of principle, I don't think that legalization of those who willfully broke the law should be a part of our agenda.\" And Idaho Rep. Raul Labrador questions the timing of tackling immigration during an election year. \"It's a great issue for Republicans to resolve; it's a bad issue for us to resolve this year,\" Labrador said. Oregon Rep. Greg Walden, who heads the House GOP re-election effort, foresees an immigration bill only after most primaries are over. \"My hunch is it doesn't come up, you know, tomorrow,\" Walden said. \"It's probably months out.\" If the retreat aimed to reach a consensus on these divisive issues, none emerged; a closing press conference was canceled.",

The first Romanians and Bulgarians with unrestricted access to the U.K. labor market have begun to arrive despite last-ditch efforts to prevent a feared wave of fresh immigration. Over the New Year's holiday, Bulgarians and Romanians became free to move across the European Union in search of jobs as the bloc's last labor restrictions were lifted. As we've previously told you, the prospect of a flood of workers from two of the EU's newest and poorest members has prompted fears of \"poverty migrants\" \u2014 especially in Britain and Germany. Indeed, some of the first Romanian workers who arrived in the U.K. were greeted by two lawmakers and a horde of reporters. One of them, Victor Spirescu, a construction worker, was asked if he had a job. He replied: \"Yes. I go to work. Tomorrow I work.\" He said he earned about $13.65 a day working in Romania; in the U.K., he said, he hoped to earn that in an hour. And, he added, with the money, he wanted to \"renovate my home and make a good life in Romania, because it's much easier to live in Romania because it's not expensive.\" The Guardian reported that when Keith Vaz, chairman of the home affairs select committee, and Mark Reckless, a committee member from the Conservative Party, went to Luton Airport \u2014 where Spirescu arrived \u2014 \"to see for ourselves\" the steps in place on the first day of unrestricted access for workers from the two countries: \"what they found was a plane three-quarters full, with the overwhelming majority of the 146 passengers returning to jobs in the U.K. having enjoyed Christmas break with their families at home. No mass stampede, this.\" Still, nearly 150,000 Bulgarians and Romanians already live in the U.K., and the new measures are expected to bring in more \u2014 an estimated 20,000 to 50,000 annually. The ruling Conservatives had made reducing immigration a key election pledge, and Prime Minister David Cameron has imposed restrictions on the benefits these new migrants can access. Still, immigration remains a sensitive issue in the U.K. Some of the fears stem from the flow of people into the country following the previous EU expansion in 2004. At the time, the government said it expected tens of thousands of Poles; instead more than 500,000 turned up. Not everyone is against the end of the restrictions. The Economist, in an open letter to the citizens of Bulgaria and Romania, noted: \"The going will be rough at first. But the history of many waves of immigration tells us that, before too long, you will be folded comfortably into British society.\" In Germany, A Political Debate A similar debate over the newcomers and access to benefits is being played out in Germany. The Bavarian Christian Social Union, allied with Chancellor Angela Merkel, says \"everything needs to be done to prevent\" the new migrants coming to Germany to live on social welfare and child benefits. But, as part of a coalition government, the center-left Social Democrats runs the country's Foreign Ministry. And Frank-Walter Steinmeier, the foreign minister and a member of the party, criticized the comments. \"European freedoms are the core of our idea of Europe; free movement of workers is an essential part of European integration,\" he told the German daily Sueddeutsche Zeitung. Those who study migration into Germany have dismissed fears of a mass influx of people from the two newest EU members. What's Behind The Furor? Bulgaria and Romania joined the EU in 2007, but the rights of their citizens to work and claim benefits across the bloc were restricted for the first seven years of their membership. But, as the BBC notes, officials in both countries have long said that fears of a flood of their workers are overblown, as many of those who wanted to leave have already done so. More than 3 million Romanians live abroad, according to the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development; and Deutsche Welle reports that 17 percent of Bulgarians are thinking about leaving for other EU states in search of jobs. Still, as The New York Times reported, \"A look at income data shows why Bulgarians and Romanians might continue to seek greener pastures.\" Here's more: \"The wealthiest one-fifth of society in Bulgaria and Romania, which joined the European Union in 2007, have a lower median income than the poorest one-fifth of society in Britain, France, Germany or other wealthy European states, according to a review of income data obtained from Eurostat, the statistics office. \"Obviously, this does not necessarily mean that being poor in Britain, France or Germany is better than being in the top income bracket in Bulgaria or Romania: The cost of living is vastly lower in Sofia than in London. \"But the lure of higher pay cannot be ignored when barriers come down, particularly as Bulgaria's unemployment has increased sharply over the last half-decade.\"",

            "article_content": "The Chamber of Commerce says it tried to help Eric Cantor in his primary campaign, but Cantor refused the offer.  MELISSA BLOCK, HOST: The man who defeated Eric Cantor, David Brat, is a dedicated free marketeer. He supports longtime conservative goals like a balanced budget amendment, but he also spent much of his campaign bashing big business lobbying groups, especially the U.S. Chamber of Commerce. He's part of a movement in the Republican Party that's deeply suspicious of big business. And as NPR's Jim Zarroli reports, Brat see groups like the chamber as part of the problem in Washington. JIM ZARROLI, BYLINE: Tuesday's election was a stunning defeat for Eric Cantor, but it also represented a big loss for the U.S. Chamber of Commerce. In campaign appearances like this one, Brat frequently made the chamber the target of his rhetorical ire. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) DAVID BRAT: My opponent, Eric Cantor, runs on the Chamber of Commerce agenda - point, after point, after point. I'm running on free markets, which is not - show favoritism to anyone. ZARROLI: Brat also took aim at some of the positions favored by the Chamber and other business groups, such as relaxing immigration laws. The election happened at a time when the Chamber is taking a much more controversial role in party politics. It has poured money into primary races in states such as Idaho and Mississippi, supporting establishment candidates. That has made it deeply unpopular with some Tea Party groups. Harvard sociologist Theda Skocpol says there's a segment of the Republican Party that strongly supports free markets but mistrusts big business. THEDA SKOCPOL: That's really a break from what you might call Chamber of Commerce, pro-business, get along, make deal, kind of Republicanism that I think a lot of people believed was the norm. ZARROLI: Skocpol spent considerable time with Tea Party groups for a book she wrote. She says this movement deeply distrusts the culture of deal making in Washington - what Brat and others call crony capitalism. Sal Russo is chief strategist for the Tea Party Express. SAL RUSSO: You see it all over the country in state houses as well, where the people that have the wealthier lobbyists get low carve outs and tax credits and benefits that most Americans don't have. ZARROLI: The Chamber of Commerce declined to comment for this story, but released a statement praising Cantor and saying it will take some time to understand the dynamics of the race. Former Michigan Governor John Engler, who now heads the Business Roundtable, takes the long view of what happened Tuesday. He says American politicians have a history of running against bigness, whether it's big business or big labor. JOHN ENGLER: I think it is way of emphasizing, I'm the underdog. The big guys are against me. I'm the little guy, and aren't you people - all the little people - with me? ZARROLI: Engler says it's possible to read too much into Tuesday's primary. Other Republicans who favor an immigration overhaul and have ties to big business have won their races this year. He also says Tea Party conservatives and business groups continue to share many of the same goals, such as less government regulation and lower taxes. Engler says, Eric Cantor may have lost... ENGLER: ...The agenda, though, in front of the Congress doesn't really change. And I think that's the one thing that I would observe - that he's going to be replaced by another Republican. ZARROLI: But the nomination of David Brat suggests that tensions remain within the Republican Party about the role that big business groups, such as the Chamber, play. Jim Zarroli, NPR News.

            "article_content": "The Homeland Security chief on Wednesday visits Nogales, Arizona. He'll tour facilities where the government has been processing children from Central America who've been entering the U.S. illegally.  RENEE MONTAGNE, HOST: It's MORNING EDITION from NPR News. Good morning. I'm Renee Montagne. DAVID GREENE, HOST: And I'm David Greene at member station WLRN in Miami. Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson is in southern Arizona today along the border with Mexico. He'll be touring facilities where the government has been processing a large number of children from Central America who've been arriving illegally. These are stunning numbers. More than 50,000 children traveling without adults have been apprehended along the border in the last nine months. It's a huge humanitarian challenge for the Obama Administration. As NPR's Scott Horsley reports, it's a political challenge as well. SCOTT HORSLEY, BYLINE: Secretary Johnson's trip to Arizona is the latest move by the Administration to address what it concedes as a big and growing problem. The White House initially blamed the wave of migrant youngsters on mounting gang violence and poverty in Central America. But Republican Congresswoman Candice Miller of Michigan argues those conditions are nothing new. CONGRESSMAN CANDICE MILLER: To say that that's a reason that we suddenly have tens of thousands of children, children traveling thousands of miles through Mexico - all the way up through Mexico - and then illegally entering the United States simply isn't true. I think that this humanitarian crisis can be laid directly at the feet of President Obama as a result of his policy in 2012. HORSLEY: That policy, adopted in the run-up to the president's re-election, allows immigrants who were brought to the country illegally as children to remain in the U.S. But only if they arrived here by 2007. The policy offers no protection to children entering the country illegally today. Still, Secretary Johnson acknowledges some new arrivals may have been misled. JEH JOHNSON: I do believe that the smuggling organizations are putting out a lot of disinformation about the conditions - the legal conditions - here in the United States to induce this activity. HORSLEY: The Administration is now belatedly trying to get the word out to families in Central America not to send their children North. Vice President Biden traveled to Guatemala last week where he delivered a blunt warning that young migrants will not be allowed to stay. VICE PRESIDENT JOE BIDEN: Make no mistake. Once an individual's case is fully heard and if he or she does not qualify for asylum, he or she will be removed from the United States and returned home. HORSLEY: Biden also promised tens of millions of dollars in aid to Guatemala, Honduras and El Salvador to combat gang violence and promote economic opportunities. But even as the Administration tries to stem the tide of future migrants, it's struggling to cope with tens of thousands of young Central Americans who are already here. They've far outgrown the government's existing facilities and officials are scrambling to lease additional space. White House spokesman Josh Earnest says the Administration's also bringing on extra attorneys and immigration judges to speed up the deportation process. JOSH EARNEST: We have taken a number of steps to surge resources to try to address this problem, both in a way that reflects the humanitarian situation, but also in a way that reflects our nation's commitment to being a nation of laws. HORSLEY: It's a familiar predicament for the White House, as it tries not to alienate either the Latino voters who helped elect the president, or the border enforcement hawks whose support is needed for immigration reform. So far, most of the criticism aimed at the White House is from Republicans. But even some Democrats, like Arizona Congressman Ron Barber, say they feel blindsided. CONGRESSMAN RON BARBER: Firstly, nobody in Arizona knew that these children were coming. I found out about it through the newspaper. The local sheriff found out about it the same way. HORSLEY: House Speaker John Boehner accused the president of failing to address the crisis. And he set up his own Republican working group to make recommendations. Boehner has urged Obama to mobilize the National Guard for help, though Secretary Johnson argues more boots on the border won't help. JEH JOHNSON: You have to realize these kids probably want to get caught. They will run to the nearest officer and say here I am. So you have to ask, will an increased border presence deter that? HORSLEY: White House spokesman Earnest notes the immigration overhaul bill passed by the Senate last year actually includes additional border enforcement. But with a war of words in Washington, and with hundreds of migrant children turning themselves into the border patrol each day, any such broad overhaul seems more of a long-shot than ever.

            "article_content": "House Speaker John Boehner's immigration proposal was shot down by his own party almost as soon as he laid it out. While it might have driven a wedge between two important Democratic groups, it still sounded too much like amnesty to many Republicans. The GOP finds itself in a pickle on immigration.  AUDIE CORNISH, HOST: From NPR News, this is ALL THINGS CONSIDERED. I'm Audie Cornish. The immigration issue has become a political hot potato for Republicans. Last year, the Senate passed a bipartisan immigration reform bill, and the House decided not to take it up. But then House Republicans changed their minds briefly until they gave up again. NPR's Mara Liasson explains where things stand now. MARA LIASSON, BYLINE: The consensus in Washington was pretty clear: immigration reform was dead for the rest of this year. But then House Speaker John Boehner brought it to life again, floating a set of principles, including legalization for undocumented workers. Eventual citizenship wasn't ruled out, and that made reform advocates in the White House hopeful Boehner's proposal might break logjam. But then almost as quickly as he had opened the door to a possible compromise, John Boehner shut it again. REP. JOHN BOEHNER: There's widespread doubt about whether this administration can be trusted to enforce our laws. And it's going to be difficult to move any immigration legislation until that changes. LIASSON: Boehner was blaming President Obama, but what really happened was a backlash from his party's conservative base. The Heritage Foundation posted this video of its domestic policy chief, Derrick Morgan, trashing Boehner's legalization idea. (SOUNDBITE OF VIDEO CLIP) BILL KRISTOL: I think if Republicans had no chance of controlling the Senate in November 2014, maybe people would have different calculations about running the risk of a bitterly divisive fight on immigration. LIASSON: Kristol and others figure that in 2015, when the Republicans have more Senate seats, maybe even a majority, they can write an immigration bill more to their liking. But to former Bush administration official, Alfonso Aguilar, also an immigration reform supporter, that's a risky strategy. ALFONSO AGUILAR: This idea that it's better to do it next year is just based on many assumptions that may actually not come true. What happens if you get to 2015, not happens. If Republicans don't do anything on immigration before the 2016 election, it's going to be very difficult for the Republican candidate - almost impossible to win the election. LIASSON: Almost impossible because Republicans can't win without more Hispanic votes. In 2012, Mitt Romney got a dismal 27 percent of the Hispanic vote. And next time, Hispanics will be an even bigger share of the electorate. While immigration may not be the tough issue for Latinos, it is what Aguilar calls a gateway issue that prevents Latinos from listening to Republicans on other issues. AGUILAR: And it's frustrating because Latinos are frustrated with unemployment. You saw the job numbers for January. Latino unemployment went up to 8.4%. They're frustrated with the state of the economy. They're concerned about the president's radical agenda on social issues. But none of that is helpful politically for Republicans if you don't get this issue right. LIASSON: And something else worries Aguilar. If they wait until 2015, the Republican presidential primary will be underway and Republican candidates for president will feel growing pressure to move to the right on immigration. They'll be traveling to places like Iowa where they'll encounter people like Steve Deace, a talk show host and conservative activist. STEVE DEACE: Once they get out from Washington, D.C., and beyond the liberal media and beltway subculture, and they get out to Iowa and South Carolina, and they visit the base of their party, they're going to figure out, if I want to be president of United States, I need to actually represent my party's interests and not the media and the ruling class's interests. So I think the issue is dead as dead as a doornail. LIASSON: There is a scenario that immigration reformers hope for and conservatives fear, that the Republican House leadership rams through an immigration bill this year with a majority of Democratic votes, just the way the speaker passed the farm bill, the budget and the debt ceiling. To Bill Kristol, that would be a bad idea, deepening the split between the GOP establishment and the party's base. Kristol says immigration reform calls for a real change of heart, not just a new political rationale. KRISTOL: They can't go to a bunch of people who were elected on one set of positions and tell them, hey, we've done some fancy electoral calculations. We looked at why Romney lost. We think ahead about some demographic changes, just change your view on this. LIASSON: So immigration remains as stubborn a puzzle as ever for the GOP. Despite repeated efforts by John Boehner and others, the party still hasn't figured out how to reach the fastest-growing block of voters in the country without alienating its conservative base. And the clock is ticking. Every month, 50,000 Hispanics in America turn 18 and become eligible to vote. Mara Liasson, NPR News, Washington. Copyright \u00a9 2014 NPR.  All rights reserved.

SCOTT SIMON, HOST: The end of the year's often a time for reflection. It certainly was for President Obama, who held his year-end press conference yesterday. NPR's White House correspondent Tamara Keith was there. TAMARA KEITH, BYLINE: At a similar press conference a year ago, President Obama said 2014 would be a breakthrough year for America. But for much of the year that seemed far from reality - what with the crisis along the southern border, so-called Islamic State militants amassing territory and forcing the U.S. military back into Iraq, the protests in Ferguson and beyond exposing difficult race relations in the country and then the arrival of Ebola. But looking back, Obama insisted it really was a breakthrough year. PRESIDENT BARACK OBAMA: More jobs, more people insured, a growing economy, shrinking deficits, bustling industry, booming energy - take any metric that you want - America's resurgence is real. We are better off. (SOUNDBITE OF PRESS CONFERENCE) (SOUNDBITE OF PRESS CONFERENCE) KEITH: Maybe it was vacation calling, but the president was upbeat and at times even a little punchy. (SOUNDBITE OF PRESS CONFERENCE) PRESIDENT BARACK OBAMA: Well, all I want for Christmas is to take your questions. KEITH: Obama said he was energized and excited about the next two years - the final two years of his presidency. (SOUNDBITE OF PRESS CONFERENCE) OBAMA: We are better positioned than we have been in a very long time and the future's ready to be written. KEITH: That future will inevitably include congressional Republicans, who will control both the House and the Senate next year. And Obama said there are real opportunities to get things done working with the new Republican Congress. (SOUNDBITE OF PRESS CONFERENCE) OBAMA: I take Speaker Boehner and Mitch McConnell at their words that they want to get things done. I think the American people would like to see us get some things done. The question's going to be are we able to separate out those areas where we disagree and those areas where we agree? I think there are going to be some tough fights on areas where we disagree. KEITH: And he said he won't be afraid to use his veto pen. Infrastructure, taxes, trade - those are areas where Obama thinks there's potential for cooperation and compromise. One area where the president can expect significant pushback from Congress is Cuba. Earlier this week, Obama announced the U.S. would begin to normalize relations with the country, but a number of Senate Republicans say he's making a terrible mistake. They say they will try to block funding for an embassy in Havana and would not confirm an ambassador. Obama defended the move even while making plain the U.S. still has many concerns when it comes to Cuba. (SOUNDBITE OF PRESS CONFERENCE) OBAMA: I don't anticipate overnight changes, but what I know, deep in my bones, is that if you've done the same thing for 50 years and nothing's changed you should try something different if you want a different outcome. KEITH: Since the election, Obama has taken executive action on immigration and now Cuba. He's tried to shape events rather than simply react to them, but the recent hacking attack on Sony Pictures Entertainment and the studio's decision not to release the film \"The Interview\" proves the president can't choose all his battles. The FBI confirmed that the North Korean government was behind the attack. North Korea denies any involvement. Obama said Sony made a mistake in pulling a film. (SOUNDBITE OF PRESS CONFERENCE) OBAMA: We cannot have a society in which some dictator someplace can start imposing censorship here in the United States. KEITH: And Obama said the U.S. won't let this cyberattack go unanswered. (SOUNDBITE OF PRESS CONFERENCE) OBAMA: We will respond proportionately and we'll respond in a place and time and manner that we choose. KEITH: As to whether he would try to watch the satirical film about an assassination attempt on the North Korean president, Obama said he has a lot of movies on his list this holiday season.

            "article_content": "In the wake of coast-to-coast defeats, Democrats are looking through the election returns for lessons.  MELISSA BLOCK, HOST: After every decisive election, the losers have to answer the question what just happened to us? Democrats will be doing that for the next several months as they lick their wounds and get ready for 2016. Here's NPR's national political correspondent, Mara Liasson. MARA LIASSON, BYLINE: Democrats knew this would be a tough election, but even if they lost red states they had hoped to hang on in states that President Obama won before, places like Colorado, Iowa and North Carolina and they were counting on their vaunted field operation to help them hang on, but it didn't. GUY CECIL: This was not a turnout election in the sense that another door knock would've mattered or another half-million would've mattered. It was a wave election. LIASSON: That's Guy Cecil, the executive director of the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee. A good ground game can make up one or two points in an otherwise close race, but this late-breaking Republican wave meant many Democrats lost in races that weren't close at all. CECIL: When you lose the governors' race in Maryland by 10 points - one of the blueist states in the country - it reveals that there's something larger going on than simply whether your technology was good or whether you knocked 10.2 million doors or 10.3 million doors. LIASSON: And what was that larger thing going on? Democrats are sifting through the rubble of Tuesday night for answers. One conclusion, says strategist Geoff Garin, is that even the best ground game only works in service to a powerful message. GEOFF GARIN: A lot of those efforts to get out the vote were based on the tactics of voting to get people to vote, but at the end of the day, what's really important is giving people a reason to vote and making them feel like it really makes a difference in their lives and we probably fell short in that regard. LIASSON: Exit polls showed the economy was the number one issue, but says former Obama White House aide Stephanie Cutter, the Democrats' economic message was muted. STEPHANIE CUTTER: I don't think that voters heard exactly the critical things that we've done over the last six years - creating millions of jobs, cutting the deficit in half, the graduation rate is up. I think as a party, across the board Democrats could've been talking about those things in a much bolder way. LIASSON: But that's not an easy argument for Democrats to make. The economy is doing much better but people don't feel it. The average family's income hasn't gone up since 1999. Not all the Democrats fault, of course, but still a heavy anchor on the party that's supposed to represent the middle class. In the exit polls, 63 percent of people who voted said the economic system favors the wealthy; a Democratic message if there ever was one, but one-third of those people voted Republican. Geoff Garin points out that voters also supported, by large majorities, Democratic positions on the environment, immigration and the economy. GARIN: The election was a national referendum on President Obama's stewardship of the economy and not participating in that discussion was costly and states where Democrats lost badly in Senate elections, voters were voting overwhelmingly to pass increases in the minimum wage. For example, policies that Democrats advocate for and Republicans tend to oppose. LIASSON: Beyond that, it's not so easy to draw clear lessons from a small group of races because the data is mixed. In three of the five purple states Democrats had hoped to hold, strong Democratic candidates did run good campaigns, but the results were different. In New Hampshire, Jeanne Shaheen won. In North Carolina, Kay Hagan lost narrowly and in Virginia, Mark Warner had a near-death experience. In the two other presidential battleground states, Iowa and Colorado, the Democratic candidates made mistakes in a year where Democrats had no margin for error. Democrats generally shunned the president this year, but in some states it's possible a presidential visit might've increased core Democratic turnout. Stephanie Cutter. CUTTER: It's also an argument if the president was sent in to some of these purple states to rally the Obama coalition that it could've provided a percentage point or two in the electorate. LIASSON: After the Republicans lost Senate seats they should have won in 2010 and 2012, they knew what they needed to do - stop nominating Tea Party candidates and insulting women, but for Democrats it's not so clear and for President Obama, this does not appear to be the time for introspection. (SOUNDBITE OF SPEECH) BARACK OBAMA: Obviously Republicans had a good night and they deserve credit for running good campaigns. Beyond that, I'll leave it to all of you and the professional pundits to pick through yesterday's results. LIASSON: And Democrats will be picking through them too as they get ready for the next election two years from now, hoping to do a lot better. Mara Liasson, NPR News, Washington.

A new, voter-approved referendum limiting the number of immigrants who enter Switzerland has unleashed tough words from the country's European partners. The AP reports that French Foreign Minister Laurent Fabius said France would \"review our relationship with Switzerland.\" German Finance Minister Wolfgang Schaeuble put it more bluntly, saying the referendum would \"cause a lot of trouble for Switzerland.\" The Wall Street Journal reports: \"The quota initiative, spearheaded by the right-wing Swiss People's Party, tapped into widespread concern that rising immigration has created too much competition for jobs, pushed up property prices and rents, and overburdened the local transportation system. About 64,000 EU citizens have settled in Switzerland every year over the past decade, according to the Federal Office for Migration.\" As the Sydney Morning Herald reports, the referendum caps the number of immigrants able to come into the country at 80,000; it passed just barely with 50.3 percent of the vote. But, the paper explains, the decision effectively tears up the \"Schengen Agreement with the European Union that allows people to travel freely without passports.\" The AFP reports that a spokesman for British Prime Minister David Cameron said the passage of the referendum reflects \"that there is growing concern around the impact that free movement can have.\" The U.K. is planning a referendum on joining the E.U. in 2017. The Journal reports that the Swiss business community is also worried. \"Switzerland's business community has cautioned the measure has the potential to jeopardize the country's robust economy, which has sidestepped the recession and high unemployment levels that have beset many of its neighbors. Switzerland sells more than half of its 201 billion Swiss francs ($224 billion) in annual exports to the EU,\" the Journal reports. \"Oliver Adler, head of research at Credit Suisse, estimates that Switzerland's economic output will likely decline by 1.2 billion Swiss francs, or 0.3% of gross domestic product, over the three-year phase-in period.\"",

Quraishi, the former chief election commissioner, sums up voting in India this way: \"The Indian election is not only the biggest election of the world \u2014 probably this is the biggest human event of the world.\" Indians streamed to the polls Monday in the first stage of a nearly six-week-long national election, and the outcome is very much in doubt. The sheer size sets the election apart: A record 814 million people \u2014 more than the electorates of the United States and Europe combined \u2014 are eligible to cast ballots. Nearly 1 million polling stations will be set up \u2014 all with electronic voting machines. Eleven million poll officials and security force members will be deployed. For the first time voters will have the option to cast their ballot for \"none of the above.\" Apart from the magnitude, the election also poses stark differences for the direction and identity of India. The Indian election is not only the biggest election of the world \u2014 probably this is the biggest human event of the world. S.Y. Quraishi, former chief election commissioner of India After 10 years in power, Sonia Gandhi's Indian National Congress Party, with its legacy of social welfare programs for the poor and megacorruption scandals, is struggling to connect with voters. The main opposition, the nationalist BJP, with its popular but controversial chief, Narendra Modi, is stirring the electorate with the promise of change. Modi choose the ancient city of Varanasi to make this stand for a seat in Parliament that could propel him to the prime minister's chair. Nowhere is Hinduism more on the display than in the 3,000-year-old city whose iconic stone steps spill into the western bank of the Ganges River. Modi's decision puts India's center for religion and spirituality smack in the center of the national campaign. Modi has sidestepped overt mention of religion, largely galvanizing Indians with a call for an economic revival along the lines of that of the western Indian state of Gujarat, where he is chief minister. India eyes China's economy with envy while its own growth has slipped below 5 percent. Actor Tilak Raj Mishra, 30, says the young are especially keen to see Modi take power.

A softening economy and corruption scandals have led to the Congress Party's hold on power being challenged. \"First of all, Narendra Modi is a great personality. He has got a vision: an idea, a vision for development for the progress of this country,\" Mishra says. \"We the people of India only want to see development, nothing but development.\" Critics argue that Modi's development model has enriched the business class but has not uplifted Gujarat's poor. Uneven Growth The heir to the Gandhi political dynasty, Rahul Gandhi, who is leading his Congress Party's campaign, slammed the Gujarat model of development at a recent rally on Modi's home turf. \"Children are dying \u2014 but they say Gujarat is shining. Shining \u2014 but for whom?\" said Gandhi, who is Sonia Gandhi's son. \"Not for children. Not for unemployed youth. Not for women.\" Then he added, \"It is definitely shining ... for 10 to 15 industrialists.\" Members of Varanasi's Muslim's community say religious disturbances are so easily ignited in India that someone as divisive as Modi at the helm would make discord more likely. Modi, 63, is a self-declared Hindu nationalist. Under his watch in 2002, Hindu-Muslim riots erupted in Gujarat and killed more than 1,000 people, mostly Muslims. Modi has never apologized and the violence marked him as a polarizing figure. \"We feel that we'll be suppressed. Suppression economically, educationally, as the Gujarat Muslims feel,\" says M.Z. Haque, who leads a Muslim academy for young boys and girls in Gujarat. Narendra Modi, leader of the Bharatiya Janata Party, attends an April 5 rally in Gandhinagar, India.

Modi, a Hindu nationalist, is seen as a strong contender to become the next prime minister, though critics say his policies would divide the country's Hindus and Muslims. But Modi is not without his Muslim backers. Kalime Ashraf, a Muslim who toils as a weaver, says a lack of modern machinery is hurting Varanasi's once prosperous sari export business. He expects Modi to modernize the industry and says like-minded Muslims have no problem voting for Modi. \"I support Modi because of development,\" Ashraf says. \"His model is successful. He's a good man. It's a good party. And I'm tired of the politics of division.\" History Of Religious Divisions Independent India was forged in religious division. The partition in 1947 that cleaved Muslim Pakistan out of predominantly Hindu India displaced millions and left hundreds of thousands dead. Spasms of religious violence still arise each year. On the outskirts of Delhi last week, Modi held several thousand supporters in thrall. \"Modi, Modi, Modi!\" they wildly chanted while he picked apart his opponents. The subject: secularism. Modi mocked Sonia Gandhi and her Congress Party's bid to unify Muslims on behalf of her party. Gandhi appealed last week to the imam of Delhi's main mosque not to split the Muslim vote \u2014 for the sake of \"secularism.\" But Modi accused Gandhi of exploiting religious differences to achieve a political end. \"The Congress Party realizes that no one in this country is going to buy their shallow slogan of secularism,\" roared Modi. \"That's why on the verge of defeat the Congress Party is now looking for votes along communal lines.\" Congress has attempted to paint Modi as a divider who is willing to stoke religious acrimony. But for many voters the economy is paramount and corruption scams worth billions have tainted Gandhi's party. Pollsters see a \"Modi-wave\" washing over India and a crashing defeat coming for Congress, the oldest political party in India. Consulting The Astrologers Regardless of party, it would not be an Indian election unless the candidates consulted the stars. Astrologer Neelam Agrawal reads politicians' charts and advises them on their chances for victory. She warns it is an especially unsettled time. \"Saturn is aligned with [tormentor] Rahu. So that creates a lot of good things for a lot of people but a lot of very, very difficult things for a lot of people. ... Turmoil. And you can see the turmoil.\" Musical troupes educate voters, sound trucks spew party songs, and high-voltage television who's-up-who's-down debates give the campaign a slight American cast. But India's election is like nothing else nowhere else. Former Chief Election Commissioner Quraishi authored An Undocumented Wonder: The Making of the Great Indian Election and he says no effort is spared to reach the hundreds of millions with ballots, even it it takes elephants, camels, boats, planes or trains. \"You name it, and that is the transport we're using. And there are some places where none of these transports will go, then polling teams have to walk.\" He says not even the lone priest living in a lion-infested forest will be left without a voting booth. Pity the poor poll watcher. The counting takes places on May 16.",

            "article_content": "In a prime-time speech on Thursday, Obama defied congressional Republicans by announcing a plan that shields up to 5 million immigrants from deportation. Via the PBS Newshour, here's video of Obama's 15-minute speech: Also, here is the text of the speech as it was prepared for delivery: My fellow Americans, tonight, I'd like to talk with you about immigration. For more than 200 years, our tradition of welcoming immigrants from around the world has given us a tremendous advantage over other nations. It's kept us youthful, dynamic, and entrepreneurial. It has shaped our character as a people with limitless possibilities \u2013 people not trapped by our past, but able to remake ourselves as we choose. But today, our immigration system is broken, and everybody knows it. Families who enter our country the right way and play by the rules watch others flout the rules. Business owners who offer their workers good wages and benefits see the competition exploit undocumented immigrants by paying them far less. All of us take offense to anyone who reaps the rewards of living in America without taking on the responsibilities of living in America. And undocumented immigrants who desperately want to embrace those responsibilities see little option but to remain in the shadows, or risk their families being torn apart. It's been this way for decades. And for decades, we haven't done much about it. When I took office, I committed to fixing this broken immigration system. And I began by doing what I could to secure our borders. Today, we have more agents and technology deployed to secure our southern border than at any time in our history. And over the past six years, illegal border crossings have been cut by more than half. Although this summer, there was a brief spike in unaccompanied children being apprehended at our border, the number of such children is now actually lower than it's been in nearly two years. Overall, the number of people trying to cross our border illegally is at its lowest level since the 1970s. Those are the facts. Meanwhile, I worked with Congress on a comprehensive fix, and last year, 68 Democrats, Republicans, and Independents came together to pass a bipartisan bill in the Senate. It wasn't perfect. It was a compromise, but it reflected common sense. It would have doubled the number of border patrol agents, while giving undocumented immigrants a pathway to citizenship if they paid a fine, started paying their taxes, and went to the back of the line. And independent experts said that it would help grow our economy and shrink our deficits. Had the House of Representatives allowed that kind of a bill a simple yes-or-no vote, it would have passed with support from both parties, and today it would be the law. But for a year and a half now, Republican leaders in the House have refused to allow that simple vote. Now, I continue to believe that the best way to solve this problem is by working together to pass that kind of common sense law. But until that happens, there are actions I have the legal authority to take as President \u2013 the same kinds of actions taken by Democratic and Republican Presidents before me \u2013 that will help make our immigration system more fair and more just. Tonight, I am announcing those actions. First, we'll build on our progress at the border with additional resources for our law enforcement personnel so that they can stem the flow of illegal crossings, and speed the return of those who do cross over. Second, I will make it easier and faster for high-skilled immigrants, graduates, and entrepreneurs to stay and contribute to our economy, as so many business leaders have proposed. Third, we'll take steps to deal responsibly with the millions of undocumented immigrants who already live in our country. I want to say more about this third issue, because it generates the most passion and controversy. Even as we are a nation of immigrants, we are also a nation of laws. Undocumented workers broke our immigration laws, and I believe that they must be held accountable \u2013 especially those who may be dangerous. That's why, over the past six years, deportations of criminals are up 80 percent. And that's why we're going to keep focusing enforcement resources on actual threats to our security. Felons, not families. Criminals, not children. Gang members, not a mother who's working hard to provide for her kids. We'll prioritize, just like law enforcement does every day. But even as we focus on deporting criminals, the fact is, millions of immigrants \u2013 in every state, of every race and nationality \u2013 will still live here illegally. And let's be honest \u2013 tracking down, rounding up, and deporting millions of people isn't realistic. Anyone who suggests otherwise isn't being straight with you. It's also not who we are as Americans. After all, most of these immigrants have been here a long time. They work hard, often in tough, low-paying jobs. They support their families. They worship at our churches. Many of their kids are American-born or spent most of their lives here, and their hopes, dreams, and patriotism are just like ours. As my predecessor, President Bush, once put it: \"They are a part of American life.\" Now here's the thing: we expect people who live in this country to play by the rules. We expect that those who cut the line will not be unfairly rewarded. So we're going to offer the following deal: If you've been in America for more than five years; if you have children who are American citizens or legal residents; if you register, pass a criminal background check, and you're willing to pay your fair share of taxes \u2013 you'll be able to apply to stay in this country temporarily, without fear of deportation. You can come out of the shadows and get right with the law. That's what this deal is. Now let's be clear about what it isn't. This deal does not apply to anyone who has come to this country recently. It does not apply to anyone who might come to America illegally in the future. It does not grant citizenship, or the right to stay here permanently, or offer the same benefits that citizens receive \u2013 only Congress can do that. All we're saying is we're not going to deport you. I know some of the critics of this action call it amnesty. Well, it's not. Amnesty is the immigration system we have today \u2013 millions of people who live here without paying their taxes or playing by the rules, while politicians use the issue to scare people and whip up votes at election time. That's the real amnesty \u2013 leaving this broken system the way it is. Mass amnesty would be unfair. Mass deportation would be both impossible and contrary to our character. What I'm describing is accountability \u2013 a commonsense, middle ground approach: If you meet the criteria, you can come out of the shadows and get right with the law. If you're a criminal, you'll be deported. If you plan to enter the U.S. illegally, your chances of getting caught and sent back just went up. The actions I'm taking are not only lawful, they're the kinds of actions taken by every single Republican President and every single Democratic President for the past half century. And to those Members of Congress who question my authority to make our immigration system work better, or question the wisdom of me acting where Congress has failed, I have one answer: Pass a bill. I want to work with both parties to pass a more permanent legislative solution. And the day I sign that bill into law, the actions I take will no longer be necessary. Meanwhile, don't let a disagreement over a single issue be a dealbreaker on every issue. That's not how our democracy works, and Congress certainly shouldn't shut down our government again just because we disagree on this. Americans are tired of gridlock. What our country needs from us right now is a common purpose \u2013 a higher purpose. Most Americans support the types of reforms I've talked about tonight. But I understand the disagreements held by many of you at home. Millions of us, myself included, go back generations in this country, with ancestors who put in the painstaking work to become citizens. So we don't like the notion that anyone might get a free pass to American citizenship. I know that some worry immigration will change the very fabric of who we are, or take our jobs, or stick it to middle-class families at a time when they already feel like they've gotten the raw end of the deal for over a decade. I hear these concerns. But that's not what these steps would do. Our history and the facts show that immigrants are a net plus for our economy and our society. And I believe it's important that all of us have this debate without impugning each other's character. Because for all the back-and-forth of Washington, we have to remember that this debate is about something bigger. It's about who we are as a country, and who we want to be for future generations. Are we a nation that tolerates the hypocrisy of a system where workers who pick our fruit and make our beds never have a chance to get right with the law? Or are we a nation that gives them a chance to make amends, take responsibility, and give their kids a better future? Are we a nation that accepts the cruelty of ripping children from their parents' arms? Or are we a nation that values families, and works to keep them together? Are we a nation that educates the world's best and brightest in our universities, only to send them home to create businesses in countries that compete against us? Or are we a nation that encourages them to stay and create jobs, businesses, and industries right here in America? That's what this debate is all about. We need more than politics as usual when it comes to immigration; we need reasoned, thoughtful, compassionate debate that focuses on our hopes, not our fears. I know the politics of this issue are tough. But let me tell you why I have come to feel so strongly about it. Over the past few years, I have seen the determination of immigrant fathers who worked two or three jobs, without taking a dime from the government, and at risk at any moment of losing it all, just to build a better life for their kids. I've seen the heartbreak and anxiety of children whose mothers might be taken away from them just because they didn't have the right papers. I've seen the courage of students who, except for the circumstances of their birth, are as American as Malia or Sasha; students who bravely come out as undocumented in hopes they could make a difference in a country they love. These people \u2013 our neighbors, our classmates, our friends \u2013 they did not come here in search of a free ride or an easy life. They came to work, and study, and serve in our military, and above all, contribute to America's success. Tomorrow, I'll travel to Las Vegas and meet with some of these students, including a young woman named Astrid Silva. Astrid was brought to America when she was four years old. Her only possessions were a cross, her doll, and the frilly dress she had on. When she started school, she didn't speak any English. She caught up to the other kids by reading newspapers and watching PBS, and became a good student. Her father worked in landscaping. Her mother cleaned other people's homes. They wouldn't let Astrid apply to a technology magnet school for fear the paperwork would out her as an undocumented immigrant \u2013 so she applied behind their back and got in. Still, she mostly lived in the shadows \u2013 until her grandmother, who visited every year from Mexico, passed away, and she couldn't travel to the funeral without risk of being found out and deported. It was around that time she decided to begin advocating for herself and others like her, and today, Astrid Silva is a college student working on her third degree. Are we a nation that kicks out a striving, hopeful immigrant like Astrid \u2013 or are we a nation that finds a way to welcome her in? Scripture tells us that we shall not oppress a stranger, for we know the heart of a stranger \u2013 we were strangers once, too. My fellow Americans, we are and always will be a nation of immigrants. We were strangers once, too. And whether our forebears were strangers who crossed the Atlantic, or the Pacific, or the Rio Grande, we are here only because this country welcomed them in, and taught them that to be an American is about something more than what we look like, or what our last names are, or how we worship. What makes us Americans is our shared commitment to an ideal \u2013 that all of us are created equal, and all of us have the chance to make of our lives what we will. That's the country our parents and grandparents and generations before them built for us. That's the tradition we must uphold. That's the legacy we must leave for those who are yet to come. Thank you, God bless you, and God bless this country we love.",

Scott Walker (center) talks about recent Republican Party gains and the road ahead for the GOP as Indiana Gov. Mike Pence (left) and Texas Gov. Rick Perry listen during a Wednesday press conference at the Republican governors' conference in Boca Raton, Fla. More than two dozen members of the Republican Governors Association gathered this week in Boca Raton, Fla., to talk about policy issues and bask in their success after the recent midterm election. Under New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie's chairmanship, the RGA spent $130 million and achieved remarkable success at the polls: All but two Republican governors running for re-election won. And the GOP even won governors' races in deep blue states like Illinois, Massachusetts and Maryland. Their message? Republican governors are putting conservative principles into practice in their states, and they won't allow their party to be defined by what they call \"the dysfunction in Washington.\" Yet even before the governors held their first news conference, they found themselves once again responding to news from Washington. In this case, it was President Obama's executive action on immigration. At news conferences, and at a Wednesday afternoon panel moderated by NBC's Chuck Todd, governors were pressed for their views on Obama's action, on immigration, and on how they would handle the millions of undocumented immigrants currently here. Louisiana's Bobby Jindal and Wisconsin's Scott Walker bristled at Todd's repeated questions on immigration. \"Scott's tried. I've tried,\" Jindal said. \"I'd like to talk about energy. I'd like to talk about education.\" Walker maintains that while immigration may be important, it was not an issue that came up in his campaign or in many other states. Walker said of immigration, \"If you went out on the campaign trail with us, none of us heard this issue in our races. And I dare say it probably wasn't one of the top issues in most United States Senate or House races out there.\" If immigration didn't rank as a top issue in most governors' races, it does with a group that's growing in importance in the U.S. \u2014 Hispanics. A recent Gallup poll shows immigration ranks as the second most important issue among Hispanics after the economy. At the conference in Boca Raton this week, Ohio Gov. John Kasich said, \"It's a cool time to be a Republican. I think young people are back looking at us again. We lost them for a while, but I think they're back. In my state, we're seeing minorities now voting Republican.\" But how Republicans respond to Obama's moves on immigration may affect how Hispanics feel about the GOP. In Texas, California, Florida and other states where Hispanics are an important voting bloc, it's likely to continue as an important issue going into 2016 \u2014 when Jindal, Walker, Kasich and other governors are considering running for president.",

Critics say the president would be going too far.\n                \n                    \n                    Jacquelyn Martin/AP\n                    \n                \nhide caption Activists rally for President Obama to use executive powers to act on immigration. Critics say the president would be going too far. The White House says President Obama will act \"relatively soon,\" on immigration, granting temporary legal status to a large number of immigrants who are in this country illegally. Obama is acting after the Republican-controlled House refused to take up a bipartisan Senate bill to overhaul the nation's immigration system. The decision to use executive powers to do what Congress would not has some critics complaining that Obama is going too far. Not so long ago, he was making that argument himself. \"The problem is that I'm the president of the United States. I'm not the emperor of the United States,\" Obama said last year when pressed to go further in halting deportations. \"We've kind of stretched our administrative flexibility as much as we can.\" That was shortly after the president's re-election, when the White House had high hopes that Congress would would pass a new immigration law. A bipartisan bill did clear the Senate, but it's been bottled up in the House. And calls for unilateral action by the president continued. Late last year, Obama told hecklers in San Francisco he appreciated their passion, but added they needed to direct their energy to changing the law. \"The easy way out is to try to yell and pretend like I can do something by violating our laws,\" Obama said. \"And what I'm proposing is the harder path \u2014 which is to use our democratic processes to achieve the same goal that you want to achieve. But it won't be as easy as just shouting. It requires us lobbying and getting it done.\" Constitutional law professor Jonathan Turley of George Washington University was happy to hear an acknowledgement from the president that it's up to Congress to change immigration law. So Turley was doubly disappointed this year when Obama changed course. \"The test of a president is often to tell his own people that more work has to be done,\" Turley says. \"And I think what's so truly dangerous about this is you have a system that's designed to force compromise and a president who's lost faith in that system.\" Obama insists he'd still prefer to see Congress make permanent changes to immigration law. But after more than a year of inaction on Capitol Hill, he is growing impatient. He told reporters over the weekend that he will use his executive authority by the end of the year to adjust enforcement policies even if those changes will be temporary. \"I can't wait in perpetuity when I have authorities that, at least for the next two years, can improve the system,\" Obama said. Some legal experts are cheering Obama on, saying the president has wide latitude in deciding how immigration laws are enforced. \"Quite honestly this is not a close call,\" says Yale Law professor Michael Wishnie. He's one of dozens of legal scholars who wrote to Obama in September, pointing to a long history of presidents using their authority in just this way. The first President Bush, for example, granted legal status to 1.5 million undocumented immigrants under a policy known as \"Family Fairness.\" Wishnie says the president's authority is rooted in both the constitutional power to conduct foreign policy and in immigration statutes, which grant broad discretion to the executive branch. The professor, who runs a legal clinic in addition to his classroom duties, sees this as more than an academic argument. \"I represent people who get up every morning and go to work, take their kids to school, and their children worry whether their parents will be home for dinner,\" Wishnie says. \"These principles matter. But so do the human costs.\" The president's action is expected to provide temporary legal status to as many as 5 million people. But Turley, who represents House Republicans in another challenge to executive action, warns it could have unintended consequences. \"It's incredibly shortsighted for the Democrats,\" Turley says. \"They have no idea who the next president may be. But whoever that person is, he or she will inherit this concentrated power that the Democrats are so willingly giving to the administration.\"",

Juan Vargas, D-Calif., speaks Wednesday as U.S. military veterans, service members and immigration reform advocates look on during a press conference urging President Obama to move forward with immigration reform at the U.S. Capitol in Washington. Maybe this duck won't be so lame after all. Judging by what we've seen so far, the \"zombie Congress\" that returned to town this week (the reelected and the not-so-lucky) will do more business in the weeks following the election than it did in many months preceding. Consider these trains \u2014 all long-sidetracked, all suddenly leaving the station on Capitol Hill: Immigration: The hot-button issue of the post-election session is the president's promise to change federal immigration practices by executive order. Republicans in the main oppose the expected changes, many strenuously. And all are incensed at the president's plan to do it unilaterally \u2014 calling it \"executive amnesty\" for lawbreakers. Nonetheless, after waiting nearly two years for the House to take up the issue, the White House has leaked an outline of its own plan, including work permits for parents of children who are American citizens or legal residents. That could give more than 3 million currently undocumented residents the legal standing to stay. There would also be deferments for another million immigrants now facing deportation, and new standing for hundreds of thousands of migrant farm workers lacking legal status. Budget and spending: Republican leaders in the House and Senate had hoped to enact an \"omnibus\" spending bill covering a dozen appropriations categories, all of which are now operating on stop-gap authority that expires at midnight Dec. 11. This omnibus would be expected to roll through the end of the fiscal year in September 2015. But GOP hardliners are loath to give up the leverage they can wield through stop-gap funding bills and a series of \"fiscal cliffs,\" which they hope to use to block Obama's immigration moves. If Obama calls their bluff, another government shutdown could ensue \u2014 a prospect Republican leadership abhors. But the anger among some in the rank and file will be hard to restrain. Sen.

Mary Landrieu, D-La., chairwoman of the Senate Energy Committee, speaks to reporters Wednesday about the new urgency to get congressional approval for the Canada-to-Texas Keystone XL pipeline at the Capitol in Washington. Keystone XL pipeline: Senate Majority Leader (until January) Harry Reid finally has scheduled a vote on authorizing this project, which the House approved on Friday (for the ninth time). Stalled for years in the no-man's land between House and Senate, this effort to suck Canadian crude from the oil sands of Alberta all the way down to refineries on the Gulf Coast finally may be on a fast track. It needs 60 votes to clear the Senate on Tuesday, but sponsors appeared on the brink of that number Friday. The White House has not said the president would sign it, but they have not threatened a veto either. So what changed? It's basically a \"Hail Mary\" pass by Reid, hoping to rescue Sen. Mary Landrieu, D-La., from defeat in her run-off election Dec. 6 (the only Senate race still unresolved). Landrieu has championed the pipeline as chair of the Senate Natural Resources Committee. National Security Agency: A bill reorganizing operations at the secret data gathering agency is a darling of many Democrats, including some who will not be returning in January. Reid would like to see it through while he's in charge, but the opposing corps of senators focused on war and terror remains strong in the Senate. No one may want to defend the practice of bulk collection of telephone call data, which was revealed by former NSA employee Edward Snowden in 2013, but these senators are wary of weakening the NSA in any way at a time when ISIS has heightened awareness of threats to the homeland. Reid has slated a vote on this divisive issue, but it may not be able to reach the 60-vote threshold.

Presidential appointments: It now appears the nomination of Loretta Lynch as the new attorney general will not be submitted to the Senate until January. This probably indicates that the White House thinks Lynch can win confirmation even in a Republican Senate. It also may mean Senate Democrats hope to focus on confirming nominees to vacant judgeships. There are 14 nominees to the federal bench at the district level who have cleared the Judiciary Committee and are ready for floor action, three of which are slated for votes on Tuesday. Nine others have had hearings in committee, but no vote. There are also many ambassadors awaiting confirmation. Thanks to a rule change Reid pushed through earlier in the 113th Congress, these judges and ambassadors can be confirmed with a simple majority of 51. After the lame duck ends and the Senate Republicans take over, however, finding even 51 votes to confirm any kind of presidential appointment will become much more difficult. That's one more reason this lame duck is likely to be lively.",

From energy and trade to taxes and regulation, there is a lot on the table, but no guarantee anything will be passed anytime soon.  MELISSA BLOCK, HOST: Exit polls taken after yesterday's voting reveal an electorate deeply worried about pocketbook issues. Business groups hope the power shift in the Senate will restart the debate over major economic matters, including immigration and tax reform. NPR's Jim Zarroli reports on what's on the wish list for business leaders and how much of it they're likely to get. JIM ZARROLI, BYLINE: Yesterday's election could mean two more years of partisan gridlock, but it could also be a chance to jump start some of the policy debates that have been stalled in Washington. Former Michigan Governor John Engler, who heads the Business Roundtable, is optimistic. JOHN ENGLER: We're going to see, I think, a lot of activity. And I think you're going to see a Congress in 2015 - looks a little bit more and behaves a lot more like Congress used to. And they're actually going to be rolling up their sleeves and getting into the policy debate. ZARROLI: There appears to be some common ground between President Obama and the Republican Congress, and one issue where compromise is possible is trade. President Obama has been a big backer of free trade agreements such as the Trans-pacific Partnership. But Senate Democrats have refused to give him what's known as fast-track authority, which would make it easier for the agreements to move forward. Under the Republicans, that's likely to change. Jeff Schott is a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics. JEFF SCHOTT: I think what we will see early in the new Congress is congressional passage of that legislation so that U.S. negotiators can tie up the final loose ends of the negotiations and sign the agreement. ZARROLI: President Obama's signature legislation, the Affordable Care Act, remains a minefield of controversy. But the president has suggested he's willing to consider certain changes, such as a repeal of the unpopular medical devices tax. Beyond that the issues get more complicated. Both President Obama and Kentucky Senator Mitch McConnell, who's likely to be the next majority leader, cited tax reform as an issue where they might be able to agree. The U.S. corporate tax rate is among the highest in the world and it's loaded with complex exemptions and deductions. Steven Rosenthal is a fellow at the Urban-Brookings Tax Policy Center. STEVEN ROSENTHAL: The bad news is Republicans and Democrats look at tax reform entirely differently. Republicans, by and large, look at tax reform as a way to reduce taxes and tax rates, and Democrats look to tax reform as a way to close loopholes. ZARROLI: For U.S. businesses, few issues are as important right now as immigration. And the debate over the issue is already sounding acrimonious. President Obama threatened again today to issue an executive order to deal with the millions of undocumented immigrants living in the United States, if Congress doesn't do so itself. Tamar Jacoby is president of Immigrationworks USA, which represents small and medium-sized businesses. She says a unilateral move by the president could do more harm than good. TAMAR JACOBY: If he goes it alone and waves a wand and gives work permits to 4 or 5 million people, the chances are that the Republican Congress is going to react with fury. And, you know, it's going to be nuclear war, basically. And in the wake of that nuclear war, there's going to be very little chance of constructive legislation. ZARROLI: But the president made clear he is anxious to move forward on immigration and other issues as well. Yesterday's election suggests that voters are weary of the ongoing stalemate in Washington. And for Congress and the White House, the next two years is an opportunity to make up for lost time.

In that heated Senate race, according to a new North Carolina study from the National Council of La Raza Action Fund and Latino Decisions, 40 percent of Latinos polled support incumbent Sen. Kay Hagan, while 15 percent support Republican challenger Thom Tillis. That means 45 percent of Hispanic voters are undecided.

A small gathering of domestic abuse victims' advocates, in a strip mall outside Reno, Nev., may seem like an unusual campaign stop at the end of election season. For Lucy Flores, this event makes sense. The young attorney and second-term assemblywoman keeps her tone light, even when the conversation touches on why she's here \u2014 domestic violence. \"This is how we solve problems, by bringing them out from under the rug,\" Flores tells the group. That might as well be Flores' mantra. She's the state assembly's assistant majority whip and is now running on the Democratic ticket for Nevada's lieutenant governor. She openly talks of her upbringing in a rough part of North Las Vegas and of ending up on juvenile parole after becoming involved with gangs. Nevada's first Hispanic governor, Republican Brian Sandoval, is popular in the state and is expected to easily win re-election, a win-win for a party eager to bring in more Latino voters. But in Flores, Nevada Democrats have their own rising Latina star, and the race could have implications for both parties nationally. At the Reno strip mall, Flores speaks with the same candor about her testimony last year on a bill addressing domestic violence. \"It was the first time that I had acknowledged publicly that I myself was a victim of domestic violence,\" she says. \"It's still a very difficult topic to talk about.\" It's not the only deeply personal story Flores has shared. Speaking in support of a sex education bill, she revealed she had an abortion as a teenager. While this honesty has grabbed headlines, she says her intention is, above all, to put a face to policy issues. \"I've never shared anything about my life just for the purpose of sharing,\" she says. \"It's always been to try to accomplish something.\" To Democrats, Flores is an ideal candidate, especially in a purple state, where the Hispanic community makes up about a third of the population. Flores is running against state Sen. Mark Hutchison.\n                \n                    \n                    John Locher/AP\n                    \n                \nhide caption Flores is running against state Sen. Mark Hutchison. \"Her only chance to win, really, is to get a very high Hispanic turnout, which I think she could generate,\" says longtime Nevada political commentator Jon Ralston. \"But it's much more difficult in an off-presidential year.\" Even though the lieutenant governor doesn't have much power, this race has gained national attention. That's because some speculate that Sandoval, the first Hispanic to hold statewide office, could run against Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid in two years. \"There's going to be an immense national pressure from Republicans after he wins [re-election] with 65, 70 percent of the vote, scores well with Hispanics here,\" Ralston says. \"They'll say he's a natural to run against Reid, assuming Reid runs.\" If Flores wins the lieutenant's job, she would become governor if Sandoval didn't serve out his term \u2014 a prospect that some say would deter him from running against Reid. To head off that possibility, the GOP is investing heavily in its candidate for lieutenant governor, Mark Hutchison, a state senator who runs a law firm in Vegas. Hutchison says he's not conceding anything to Flores, including the Hispanic vote. \"I've been a leader in calling for comprehensive immigration reform,\" he says. \"I gave a speech about that on the floor of the Senate.\" He's also supported driver privilege cards for undocumented immigrants and more funding for English-language learners. \"So I think that I have demonstrated that I believe about the importance of the Hispanic community, and I have been very much in touch with what their concerns are,\" Hutchison says. The governor's backing gives Hutchison a distinct advantage, but Flores believes voters will split their ticket, casting a vote for a Republican governor and her, a Democrat, for lieutenant. \"Nevada is still a place where people vote for the person,\" she says.",

Wendy Davis shakes hands with state Attorney General Greg Abbott after their debate in the Rio Grande Valley on Friday.\n                \n                    \n                    Gabe Hernandez/AP\n                    \n                \nhide caption Texas state Sen. Wendy Davis shakes hands with state Attorney General Greg Abbott after their debate in the Rio Grande Valley on Friday. The candidates running for Texas governor, Republican Attorney General Greg Abbott and Democratic State Sen. Wendy Davis, held their first televised debate on Friday in heavily Hispanic South Texas, in the border county of Hidalgo in the Rio Grande Valley. The county is 90 percent Hispanic. It was the first gubernatorial debate on the border since 1998. Republicans have won every statewide office in Texas for 20 years, but the fast-growing Hispanic population tends to vote Democrat, and many Republicans believe their survival lies in recruiting Hispanic supporters. Carlos Sanchez, editor of Hidalgo's largest newspaper, The Monitor, calls the event the Rio Grande Valley's debut. \"I think this election cycle is a demonstration that smart statewide candidates are taking the valley and Hispanic voters very seriously,\" Sanchez says. The Davis-Abbott debate follows a summer in which Hidalgo County made national headlines. Thousands of undocumented children from Central America came over the border, filling detention centers. Gov. Rick Perry deployed 1,000 Texas National Guard troops to the border. In their debate, Abbott and Davis both supported the surge in law enforcement, because Washington hadn't secured the border. Then Davis called Abbott insensitive to the citizens here. She recalled a speech he gave linking border crime to \"third-world corruption.\" \"Comments from my opponent calling this area third-world are inappropriate,\" Davis said. \"They label a community.\" \"I made that statement about corruption across the state of Texas \u2014 not targeting the Rio Grande Valley,\" Abbot answered. Abbott said he in fact feels a personal responsibility to root out anti-Hispanic rhetoric, because he has a personal stake in the community. \"I've been married into a Hispanic family for 33 years now,\" he said. \"My wife and I celebrated our 33rd wedding anniversary last month.\" Abbott has made more than a dozen trips to the valley during his campaign, and broadcasts ads in Spanish. In a region with higher-than-average unemployment and many immigrants, though, Davis' backing of a higher minimum wage and drivers licenses for undocumented people have a welcome ring. Abbott opposes both. Latino voters alone probably won't swing this governor's election, but candidates clearly believe they're an important part of winning. At Friday's debate, Sanchez said he hopes the hoopla over the debate gets more valley residents to the polls. \"The notion they can show up and demonstrate that their political clout can be transferred through numbers is the most exciting thing that's happening in this auditorium tonight,\" he said.",

            "article_content": "When New Mexico Democratic gubernatorial candidate Gary King told the crowd at the Democratic Party of Valencia County annual fundraiser on Sept. 6 that Republican Gov. Susana Martinez \"does not have a Latino heart,\" he was reportedly paraphrasing previous remarks made by famous labor icon and native New Mexican Dolores Huerta. King probably meant to say that Gov. Martinez's policies don't align with the policy preferences of New Mexico's Latino electorate, but by parroting Huerta, he may have inserted a racial element into the campaign that could cause some Latino voters to pause. Back in 2010, Martinez became the nation's first female Hispanic governor by earning 38 percent of the state's Latino vote, while her Democratic opponent, Diane Denish, earned 61 percent of the state's Latino vote. In the 2010 race, Martinez captured 54 percent of the overall vote in New Mexico. New Mexico gubernatorial candidate Gary King speaks at an event in Albuquerque.\n                \n                    \n                    Craig Fritz/AP\n                    \n                \nhide caption New Mexico gubernatorial candidate Gary King speaks at an event in Albuquerque. Recent polling from the Albuquerque Journal shows that in the current race for governor, King still leads Martinez among Latino voters, but that edge has been significantly diminished. An August poll of likely New Mexico voters showed that among Latinos, 56 percent preferred King and 36 percent favored Martinez. A newer poll conducted last week after the \"Latino heart\" comment showed that 45 percent of New Mexico's Latino voters support King, while 44 percent of Latino voters support Martinez, and 11 percent say they are undecided. The pollster for the Albuquerque Journal, Brian Sanderoff, remarked on King's loss of support among New Mexico's Latinos: \"It may have contributed to some of his (King's) slippage among Hispanics,\" Sanderoff said. King, as an Anglo candidate running against the nation's first female Hispanic governor, \"was not the right messenger.\" The issue of the messenger is key here. Dolores Huerta, an 84-year-old activist who was born in northern New Mexico, might be able to get away with making a racially tinged remark about Martinez. (Huerta has made similar ethnically charged statements before, such as \"Republicans hate Latinos,\" which she said to a group of Tucson high school students in 2006.) But many people, Latinos and non-Latinos alike, chafe against someone criticizing another person's ethnic identity based on political leanings. King could perhaps have more accurately said that Martinez's conservative policies don't line up with the expressed policy preferences of the state's Latino voters instead of attaching so-called Latino qualities to the governor's vital organ. According to polling from October 2012 from Latino Decisions, 52 percent of New Mexico Latinos said immigration was \"the most important issue\" or \"one of the most important issues\" in their voting decisions for that election cycle. Similarly, in that same poll from two years ago, a majority of Latino New Mexicans knew someone who was undocumented, and a majority of Latino New Mexicans supported a driver's license compromise than stricter requirements for undocumented drivers. New Mexico Gov. Susana Martinez (right) talks about the state's green chile during a visit to a restaurant in Bernalillo.\n                \n                    \n                    Susan Montoya Bryan/AP\n                    \n                \nhide caption New Mexico Gov. Susana Martinez (right) talks about the state's green chile during a visit to a restaurant in Bernalillo. Shortly after being elected governor, in an interview with Latina magazine, Martinez had to be reminded of what the DREAM Act was because she couldn't answer a question about that policy. The DREAM Act is a federal legislative proposal that would legalize undocumented youth who satisfy certain requirements; it's a policy proposal that is popular with Latino voters and that has been around for over a decade. Martinez has also tried repeatedly to repeal a state law that grants undocumented people in New Mexico driver's licenses. Last year, the Annie E. Casey Foundation issued a report that placed New Mexico dead last for overall child well-being. Almost 60 percent of the children in New Mexico are Latino. Instead of making ill-phrased remarks about \"Latino hearts,\" King might have criticized Martinez over her immigration policies and child welfare record. But Latinos are already the largest ethnic group in New Mexico, and as their political influence increases, they will continue to hold positions across party lines. So playing ethnic politics by body part or even having prominent Latino Democrats publicly express that other Latinos are \"not Latino enough\" simply because they don't fall in line with the preferences of the majority within their group will likely become less tolerable. Especially in a state where many Latinos can trace family histories to a time when there weren't Democrats, Republicans or Anglo politicians seeking their approval.

Unofficial returns showed Raimondo with 42 percent of the vote, compared with 29 percent for Angel Taveras, and 27 percent for Clay Pell.

In the GOP gubernatorial primary, Cranston Mayor Allan Fung scored a solid victory over challenger Ken Block, 55 percent to 45 percent. The scene for Raimondo's campaign-watch was part of the Hope Artiste Village complex where she launched her campaign in January, and her campaign reprised the sound of Canned Heat's \"Let's Work Together.\" The song reflected her move to the left, to cobble together a winning Democratic primary coalition (backing such measures as driver's licenses for undocumented immigrants). While Raimondo touted her regular credentials as \"Gina from Smithfield\" during the campaign, the Yale- and Oxford-educated former venture capitalist has built a national reputation since bursting on Rhode Island's political scene by winning the race for treasurer in 2010. She moved quickly and steadily to shape the battlefield over a sweeping pension overhaul the next year; as a result, opposing the reform in the General Assembly took on a higher perceived political cost, and the measure passed overwhelmingly before being signed into law by Gov. Lincoln Chafee. Critics seized on the pension overhaul \u2014 and revelations about tens of millions in fees paid for hedge fund investments backed by Raimondo \u2014 to charge that she was more responsive to Wall Street than to struggling Rhode Islanders. Taveras, the well-liked mayor of Providence, took up the theme in his campaign by touting himself as the candidate of working families. Raimondo responded by saying she would be a governor for all Rhode Islanders, bringing a more muscular focus to overcoming the state's persistently high unemployment and other chronic problems. During her 25-minute campaign announcement in January, Raimondo compared her petite frame with Rhode Island's distinction as the smallest of the 50 states. \"Usually when people meet me for the first time, they say, 'Oh, I thought you'd be bigger.' But the truth is, it's because we are small that we can do things that have never been done before,\" Raimondo said. \"But we have to start by thinking bigger and bolder, and it's time to change the tone at the top. We need a tone at the top \u2014 a governor with a tone of urgency and focus and possibility as we turn this economy around.\" Taveras remained in contention in late August, when a Providence Journal-WPRI poll showed him with 27 percent of the support, compared with 32 percent for Raimondo \u2014 a disparity barely larger than the margin of error. Yet the surprising entry into the race earlier this year of Clay Pell, the grandson of the late Democratic Sen. Claiborne Pell, scrambled the dynamic and wound up cutting sharply into the support for Taveras. Since winning election as mayor of Providence in 2010, the former Housing Court judge emerged with the most consistently high approval ratings in a series of Brown University polls. But Taveras (who raised more than $2 million) lagged in fundraising behind Pell (who loaned himself $3.4 million), and Raimondo, an adept fundraiser who brought in more than $4 million just since April. A union coalition rallied behind Taveras, but that wasn't nearly enough to salvage his campaign. Raimondo will face Cranston Mayor Allan Fung in the November election. Fung beat Barrington businessman Ken Block, who in his concession speech, reminded the room of supporters that his campaign offered solutions to the problems facing Rhode Island. \"We did not receive the support of the majority of Republican primary voters today,\" said Block. \"But that does not mean that we just simply go home and stop caring, because I am looking out at a large group of people who care.\" Unofficial results show Fung beating Block 55 percent to 45 percent.",

Former Massachusetts Sen. Scott Brown moved one step closer to returning to Washington with a win Tuesday in New Hampshire's Republican U.S. Senate primary. With 78 percent of the state's 301 precincts reporting, Brown had just under 50 percent of the vote, according to the Associated Press. His two main opponents, former state Sen. Jim Rubens and former U.S. Sen. Bob Smith, split most of the remaining ballots. Brown will take on Democratic Sen. Jeanne Shaheen in November, a match-up that seemed like a foregone conclusion from the moment Brown entered the race in April. Aside from a single television debate, Brown virtually ignored his primary competitors and, with the help of several deep-pocketed outside groups, went right after Shaheen. Taking his cue from Republican candidates around the country, Brown immediately began framing the race as a referendum on the Affordable Care Act. A day after launching his campaign, he began an \"Obamacare Isn't Working\" tour, calling Shaheen \"the deciding vote\" in the Senate for the health care reform law. In late July, after thousands of undocumented children began showing up on the U.S. border from Central America, Brown shifted his attacks to what he called the \"immigration crisis on our hands.\" He launched television ads that criticize Shaheen for supporting immigration reforms that would include a path to citizenship for undocumented immigrants already living in the U.S., which Brown characterizes as \"amnesty.\" Brown won a special election in 2010 to replace the late Massachusetts Sen. Edward Kennedy, but was beaten handily in 2012 by Democrat Elizabeth Warren. He moved to New Hampshire, where he had a vacation home, in 2013. Early polls showed Shaheen with leads of 8-10 points over Brown, but that margin appears to have narrowed in recent weeks. In late August, a poll conducted for the political group American Crossroads had Shaheen with a 3 point lead. A more recent CBS News/New York Times poll showed Shaheen with a six point lead. The contours of the coming battle in the general election began to take shape while primary voters were still trekking to the polls, as Shaheen's campaign released two new television ads Tuesday. One touts her record, including her role in preventing the closure of the Portsmouth Naval Shipyard and in securing funding for the I-93 expansion and the Memorial Bridge project. The other amplifies familiar attacks on Brown, including shots at votes he took when he was in the Senate that allowed the five largest oil companies to continue claiming certain deductions to reduce their tax bills. If Brown beats Shaheen, he would become only the third U.S. senator to have represented more than one state, and the first since voters took over for state legislators and began directly electing U.S. senators. In comments at the Puritan Conference Center in Manchester, Shaheen didn't outright call Brown a carpetbagger \u2014 but the message was clear. \"The fact is, Scott Brown may have changed his address, but he hasn't changed his stripes,\" she said. \"So now Big Oil and the Koch brothers and Wall Street are spending millions to get Scott Brown back to the Senate. But we are not going to let that happen. New Hampshire is not for sale and New Hampshire is not Scott Brown's consolation prize.\" In the state's gubernatorial primary, Walt Havenstein won the GOP nomination and will face incumbent Democratic Gov. Maggie Hassan in November. In the 1st Congressional District, former GOP Congressman Frank Guinta will face incumbent Democratic Rep. Carol Shea-Porter, whom he beat in 2010 and lost to in 2012. In the 2nd Congressional District, Republican Marilinda Garcia, who at 31 would become one of the two youngest members of the House, will face Democratic Rep. Ann McLane Kuster.",

Mo Brooks, R-Ala., speaks with reporters following a closed-door Capitol Hill meeting in October 2013.\n                \n                    \n                    Susan Walsh/AP\n                    \n                \nhide caption Rep. Mo Brooks, R-Ala., speaks with reporters following a closed-door Capitol Hill meeting in October 2013. Even as Republican leaders wrap up a summer meeting in Chicago where they're preparing for 2016, the party's fate in that election may be getting shaped in other places. Places like Okoboji, Iowa, where Rep. Steve King was captured on video getting into an extended argument with self-described \"DREAMers,\" American-raised children of undocumented immigrants. Or Alabama, where Rep. Mo Brooks has been describing immigration overhaul efforts as part of a Democratic \"war on whites.\" Or even Washington, D.C., where a week ago, in order to win the support of immigration opponents like King and Brooks on a border crisis spending bill, leaders brought to the floor a companion bill ending President Obama's DACA (Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals) program that permits children who were brought to this country as minors by undocumented immigrants to remain. Neither bill is likely to become law, but, say political strategists in both parties, the damage is done. While there may be little effect in the coming midterm elections \u2014 when Hispanic turnout is typically depressed \u2014 anger over the legislation and the well-publicized comments could cement a perception that becomes difficult to change by 2016. \"It just reinforces existing beliefs about Republican views on immigration and, more broadly, Hispanics generally,\" said Anna Greenberg, a Democratic pollster. \"It's further evidence we're departing further and further into the wilderness,\" said John Weaver, a former adviser to Arizona Sen. John McCain. \"I don't really notice the 'war on whites' myself, but maybe it's raging in northern Alabama.\" McCain is among the 13 sitting GOP senators who last year voted for an immigration overhaul that includes a path to citizenship for the 12 million undocumented immigrants in the United States. It's that feature that angers many House Republicans, who typically represent districts with tiny Latino populations. They argue that any immigration law changes are inappropriate before the border with Mexico is fully secured. In their opposition, they are also bucking leaders of the Republican National Committee, which last year specifically cited immigration legislation as a way to open doors among Hispanics and other minority groups. It was this sensibility, in fact, that spurred House leaders to push for the border bill last week, even though it meant postponing the start of the August recess. Speaker John Boehner had already put out a statement suggesting that attempts to pass a $659 million funding bill were being abandoned for want of votes. Boehner and his team were quickly besieged by Republicans worried about heading home without having done anything about the tens of thousands of unaccompanied children who had crossed the border. Republicans would seem uncaring, and Obama would have a political field day. But in their desperation to win over immigration opponents, House leaders agreed to take up the proposal to end Obama's DACA program. It passed, with 212 Republican yes votes, and 11 Republicans voting no. (All but four Democrats voted against it.) King was among those crowing about their victory \u2014 which led to Monday's confrontation at an Iowa fundraiser. Alabama's Brooks, meanwhile, defended the anti-DACA bill and dismissed criticisms against it as part of the Democratic \"war on whites.\" (On a Huntsville, Ala., radio show Wednesday with National Journal columnist Ron Fournier, Brooks accused Fournier of contributing to divisiveness with his \"commentary\" \u2014 though Fournier was quoting from the Republican Party's own Growth and Opportunity Project.) Both incidents have gotten widespread play in the media \u2014 more play than the Republican Party's outreach to Latinos is getting nowadays. In an interview with RealClearPolitics from Chicago, GOP chairman Reince Priebus called Brooks' remarks \"idiotic.\" \"We have to be a party that grows. That means we have to have more people in our party, not less,\" Priebus said. Weaver, who in recent years has criticized the party for its failure to embrace an immigration overhaul, said the latest turn proves his point. \"If you're on the wrong side of history on immigration, that's not a good place to be,\" he said.",

            "article_content": "Reports over the weekend indicated President Obama would take executive action soon to grant legal status to millions of undocumented immigrants. The White House says that is speculation.  STEVE INSKEEP, HOST: Now some of this year's close races could be affected by the debate over immigration. There were reports over the weekend that President Obama is preparing to take executive action to grant legal status to millions of undocumented immigrants. LINDA WERTHEIMER, HOST: The White House says that's just speculation. But for more on what the president might have in mind and what the blowback might be, we are joined as we are most Monday mornings by Cokie Roberts. Good morning, Cokie. COKIE ROBERTS: Hi Linda. WERTHEIMER: So executive action wouldn't that just excite the Republicans who are already calling for President Obama's impeachment? ROBERTS: Well, that of course might be what the president has in mind. The impeachment talk has been much more among Democrats than among Republicans and it has been very useful in raising money for Democrats. Look, you're talking about an election where each party really needs to try to excite and get out its voters. And as you well know Democrats don't show up in the same numbers in off year elections as Republicans do. And so, we're looking right now - in fact over the weekend NBC/Wall Street Journal poll showed basically a tie among people saying which party they want to control the Congress. And so both parties are trying to get out their base. The president says, look Republicans are not pass an immigration bill, we have to do something about immigration, we have a crisis at the border, so I have to act. And if that gins up impeachment talk so much the better from his perspective. WERTHEIMER: So, what are the - what do the Republicans want, do you think? ROBERTS: Well, we saw at the end of last week as they were trying to get out of town for August recess, that they couldn't pass an immigration bill in the House of Representatives. They had to pull down a bill that was just offering a very small sum of money to help with what's going on with the unaccompanied children at the border. And they've finally brought it back up on Friday. But that bill just gives a little - some money and calls for deporting the children. And then the Republicans added another vote, which was to rescind the presidents executive action that says that children who came to this country as little children and came before 2009 can stay here at least temporarily, the so-called dreamers. The Republicans knowing that the president would veto both of those bills if they ever got to him still decided to make that case that the dreamers should not have legal status. This is, you know, this is a vote that most Republicans and particularly the republican leadership understand it's going to be very tough for them. But they took it away. WERTHEIMER: What are the long-term consequences do you think of the Republican strategy? ROBERTS: Well, I think that in the long term they're likely to be very, very dangerous for them and the Republicans,  as I said and as you know, are quite concerned about this. There was a poll over the weekend about these unaccompanied minors that showed that 70 percent, including a majority of Republicans, are saying that they should be treated as refugees not as illegal immigrants who should be sent home. And you know we've seen this in our lifetimes, Linda, where we saw African-Americans sign up with the Republicans from the time of Lincoln on and then switch massively to the Democratic Party through the civil rights years. And we could be seeing the same kind of thing with Hispanic Americans, now with the signals being sent by the House of Representatives. And that might not be a problem for them in 2014, probably won't be, but 2016 on, big problem. WERTHEIMER: Cokie, thank you. ROBERTS: Thank you Linda.

The House Rules Committee won't let it come to a vote.  STEVE INSKEEP, HOST: Last night in a meeting room on an upper floor of the Capitol building there was a vote on immigration. It was the closest the House has comes this year to voting on that issue and the vote failed. The House Rules Committee rejected an attempt by a Republican lawmaker to let immigrants brought to this country illegally as children earn permanent residency by serving in the military. NPR's SV Date reports. S.V. DATE, BYLINE: Jeff Denham is a Republican Congressman but he doesn't represent the typical Republican House district. It's in the northern part of California's Central Valley, with lots of Mexican-American and other Latino constituents. Knowing his house colleagues' aversion to a major immigration overhaul, the Gulf War veteran thought he could champion a very limited overhaul, one that could ride along with the annual defense authorization bill. Here's Denham making his case. REPRESENTATIVE JEFF DENHAM: These men and women want to serve the only country that they know. They're willing to put their lives on the line for our freedom. Why wouldn't we have that as part of the National Defense Reauthorization Bill? DATE: Unlike the bill the Senate passed last year with a path to citizenship for unlawful immigrants, Denham's proposal allows such a path only to those brought here as children who then enlist in the military. UIDENTIFIED MAN: Platoon! Attention! DATE: Denham and immigration overhaul advocates staged a news conference yesterday. They brought in a dozen Dreamers, as they are known, from around the country dressed in matching T-shirts and camouflage caps. They talked about their years in high school and college ROTC, and their hopes of one day joining the real military. Michael Nazario was brought to this country when he was six. When he was in high school ROTC, he told his father he'd made a decision. MICHAEL NAZARIO: I told him: Dad, papa, I want to be a Marine. I want to serve my country. I saw his face. A blank face. He said, mijo, son, you won't be able to. Why? Because you lack a nine-digit Social Security number. DATE: Nazario was among the Dreamers at the Capitol yesterday who were told House Speaker John Boehner had already made it clear Denham's plan was not going forward, at least for now. HOUSE SPEAKER: Trying to do this on the National Defense Authorization bill seems to us to be an inappropriate place to do it. DATE: So would Boehner allow a vote on the issue as a free-standing bill? , REPUBLICAN, OHIO: There have been discussions about that but no decisions. DATE: But the way Denham sees it there's been plenty of discussion already. He first pushed to add his plan to last year's defense authorization bill - quitting only with the understanding that a stand-alone bill doing the same thing would get a hearing. So far, though? Nothing. DENHAM: It's been a year, still hasn't been resolved. I made it very clear that I was bringing this up either as an amendment or a standalone bill, and we're going to continue to push to do that. DATE: Despite the no-go signal, Denham went ahead and made his case to the House Rules Committee, which decides how much time any bill gets on the floor and which amendments will be allowed. Denham explained to the committee that the United States has a long history of allowing foreigners to earn a chance at American citizenship by serving in the military. He said he himself had served with Filipinos in the Gulf War who were given that opportunity. And he tried reminding the committee that it had approved the exact amendment he is seeking now a year ago. None of it worked. The committee's heavy majority of Republicans voted as Boehner and Majority Leader Eric Cantor suggested they should. Denham says he's not giving up. DENHAM: I'll continue to push it as a stand-alone bill and drive my conference as well as drive the entire House. We've got over 50 co-sponsors already and we'll continue to get more. DATE: But if he doesn't succeed, then Tuesday's committee vote could be the last official word on immigration in the Republican House before this fall's election. S.V. Date, NPR News, the Capitol.

            "article_content": "Rep. Michael Grimm of New York turned himself in to face federal charges related to a health food restaurant he ran before he was elected to Congress. The Republican congressman says he's innocent and plans to run for re-election this fall, but Democrats have have high hopes of flipping the last GOP-held seat in New York City.  MELISSA BLOCK, HOST: New York City's lone Republican congressman pleaded not guilty today to federal fraud charges. This comes after a two-year investigation. Michael Grimm is accused of concealing more than $1 million in sales at a restaurant he owned and operated before serving in Congress. Grimm has been a member of the House Financial Services Committee, but he announced today that he is stepping down from that position. As NPR's Joel Rose reports, Grimm says he's the victim of a political vendetta. JOEL ROSE, BYLINE: Even before he went into politics, Michael Grimm had a colorful career. He was a Marine, an FBI agent, and for a few years in the mid-2000s, he was part owner and manager of a restaurant in Manhattan. Those are the years prosecutors focused on today. LORETTA LYNCH: When it came to his restaurant, Michael Grimm never met a tax he didn't lie to his aide. ROSE: U.S. Attorney Loretta Lynch announced the charges - 20 counts, including mail fraud, hiring undocumented workers and filing false tax returns. Lynch says Grimm simply removed $1 million in cash from his Upper East Side eatery called Healthalicious. LYNCH: Grimm took the cash from the register, used part of it to pay the workers off the books, never reporting it to the taxing authorities. Grimm turned himself into the FBI this morning. Assistant director George Venizelos says the case is especially disappointing because Grimm worked at the bureau as an undercover agent investigating fraud. GEORGE VENIZELOS: It's a sad day for the FBI. I mean, nobody's happy. Everybody's upset about it. He should've known better, so it makes it worse. ROSE: The indictment stems from a two-year investigation that reportedly started with Grimm's campaign finances. His troubles made national news when a local TV reporter asked him about the investigation in January. REPRESENTATIVE MICHAEL GRIMM: You ever do that to me again, I'll throw you in the (bleep). ROSE: Grimm responded off mic with a profanity-laced threat to throw the reporter off a balcony in the Capitol. Now, Grimm is vowing to defend himself vigorously. Grimm pleaded not guilty. He was released on bond and immediately held a news conference outside the courthouse in Brooklyn. GRIMM: We're going to fight tooth and nail. We're going to fight tooth and nail until I am fully exonerated. ROSE: Grimm says the charges against him are trumped up and he shot back at prosecutors, accusing them of leaking information about the investigation to the press in order to discredit him. GRIMM: Since day one, the press has been fed all types of innuendos and accusations to support - now let me be very clear - political witch hunt. And this political witch hunt was designed to do a couple of things, but first and foremost, assassinate my character and remove me from office. ROSE: Grimm's supporters also question the timing of the announcement. It's too late for Republicans to remove Grimm's name from the ballot this fall. His seat, which includes Staten Island and parts of Brooklyn, is the only one in New York City currently held by the GOP, and maybe not for long, says Douglas Muzzio, who teaches public affairs at the City University of New York's Baruch College. DOUGLAS MUZZIO: Basically, the last outpost is Staten Island. You know, it's sort of a swing seat anyway and with a 20-count indictment hanging over your head, that's real tough. ROSE: Still, some of Grimm's constituents say they're willing to give him the benefit of the doubt. David Atkinson of Staten Island praised Grimm for breaking with the Republican Party leadership during the recent debate on food stamp benefits. DAVID ATKINSON: Anytime your whole party says yes, and you say no, that's a hell of a man. The Congressman Grimm that I know, the congressman that stood up for the poor people in Staten Island, that's a man that stands up for his own. ROSE: But Democrats around the country have been talking about Michael Grimm's seat as a prime pickup opportunity for the party this fall and that was before today's indictment.

Activists say they plan more rallies and demonstrations across the country to push for action on immigration reform. Activists who support an overhaul of the immigration system are angry and frustrated. The immigration bill that passed in the Senate in June is stalled out. Meanwhile, the Obama administration is on pace to deport some 2 million illegal immigrants since taking office six years ago. The anger was evident in Alabama this week, where a small group of undocumented residents and their supporters demonstrated in front of the Etowah County Detention Center. They called for an end to the deportations and their chants specifically targeted the president. \"Obama, listen! We are in the fight!\" they chanted in Spanish. Like many pro-immigration activists around the country, they want the president to use his executive powers to curb the deportations. \"There are many activists who have already given up on the legislative route and say, 'House Republicans aren't going to act, [so] let's pressure the president,' \" says Frank Sharry, executive director of America's Voice, an immigration advocacy group. \"And much of our dynamic but sometimes fractious movement is already there.\" Some activists got a chance to make their case directly to the president at the White House in a recent off-the-record meeting. They described how the deportations are hurting their communities. Obama told the activists they should keep their focus on Congress to pass immigration legislation over the next three months, Sharry says. \"And if at the end of three months or so, if Congress hasn't acted, then he made it clear that he would be prepared to see what he could do through executive action,\" he says. The three-month deadline is important because it pressures Congress to act before the August recess and the midterm election season kicks into high gear. The president announced March 13 that he had ordered a review of deportation practices. According to published reports, the Department of Homeland Security might ease up on deportations of illegal immigrants with no criminal record. The administration could also scale back a controversial program in which local officials hold illegal immigrants until the Feds pick them up. \"There are many things he could do that are within his authority,\" says Pablo Alvarado, who directs the National Day Laborer Organizing Network in Los Angeles. \"There is a national consensus now that people that would be legalized through the Senate bill that was passed last year, should not be deported,\" he says. The bipartisan bill, which would create a path to citizenship for undocumented immigrants living in the U.S., has stalled in the House. \"He could easily come and say, I'm not going to deport these people,\" Alvarado says. Whatever steps the administration takes, it's clear the White House is under pressure to placate its critics in the pro-immigration camp. Mark Krikorian, executive director for the Center for Immigration Studies, says some of what the White House is doing is \"just throwing a bone to the activist groups to keep them quite until the election.\" That political calculation is key, but he says any move to please Latino voters in November could also backfire. \"The result would be in a midterm election, not so much increasing Democratic turnout,\" Krikorian says, \"rather what it's likely to do is energize Republicans who are already predisposed to turn out in larger numbers.\" But for now, immigration activists such as Alvarado still want to keep their pressure on the president. \"I voted for President Obama, I want him to succeed, to be a champion for us, an emancipator rather than a deporter in chief,\" he says. \"But he has to make a choice and that time is now.\" Activists say they plan to take to the streets with their campaign to stop the deportations with a series of rallies and demonstrations across the country in April and May.",

Embrace and champion comprehensive immigration reform, the post-mortem authors urged, or get used to a party whose appeal \"will continue to shrink to its core constituents only.\" That bold assertion was decidedly offstage Monday, as the party orchestrated a full-on media effort to mark advances it says it's made as a result of recommendations contained in the 2013 Growth and Opportunity Project report. Republican National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus pointed to successes over the past 12 months including improved data collection, new state-level staffers more involved in minority communities, and a rejiggering of the presidential primary, debate and convention schedules \u2014 calendar changes designed to condense the season and not leave the eventual nominee so battered. The party has already moved the start of its primary season to February, its convention to late June or early July, and is working to limit the number of candidate debates. Glenn McCall, a committee member from South Carolina and one of five co-authors of the 2013 \"autopsy,\" said that the party had heard the message that \"we were not showing up.\" McCall, who is African-American, said that he has seen \"solid progress, and comprehensive progress\" in terms of party field workers going to \"communities where we've never gone before.\" Sally Bradshaw, a Florida committee member and report co-author, said some of the progress the party has made on the digital and data front helped Republican candidate David Jolly win a Florida special election last week for a vacant congressional seat. The victory over Democrat Alex Sink, Bradshaw said, was in part due to a new canvassing app developed by the national committee that provided voter log lists and other data fed directly to the RNC. But it was clear during an RNC-arranged media call that party leaders wanted to avoid an issue that has pitted electorally pragmatic GOP members against a right flank that has blocked immigration reform in the U.S. House \u2014 especially at a time when the Democratic Party is struggling for a midterm issue and faces losing control of the Senate this fall. \"We obviously recommended that Republicans support immigration reform,\" said Henry Barbour, a Republican National Committee member from Mississippi and one of the report co-authors. \"We'll continue to encourage people along those lines.\" A comprehensive immigration overhaul bill approved last summer by the Senate has stalled in the GOP-controlled House. The recurring theme of Monday's call was to focus on what's happening in the states, rather than on federal immigration legislation. \"We're not dictating how policy, how that question is handled on the Hill,\" said McCall. \"We recommended it and see it as something of importance to the party,\" he said, but he noted that it's out of the RNC's purview to pursue action on the Hill. Priebus ordered the so-called autopsy report after Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney attracted only 27 percent of the Hispanic vote in 2012 and young voters and women helped propel President Obama to a second term. The resulting assessment was seen by some as a clear-eyed examination of a party at risk of being overrun by demographic and generational changes. But many Tea Party and social conservatives were infuriated by what they, at the time, characterized as an effort by the GOP establishment to control the issues and dialogue. Those criticisms remain, particularly around legislation that would overhaul the nation's immigration system, including establishing a path to citizenship \u2014 anathema to the more conservative wing of the party. \"There are many ways to do it,\" said Bradshaw. The RNC, she said, is not trying to \"proscribe or limit\" ways to do it. She and others pointed to immigration-related efforts in states such as Florida, where Republican Gov. Rick Scott, in a tough re-election year, has proposed allowing \"qualified Florida students\" to pay in-state college tuition rates regardless of their immigration status. The National Conference of State Legislatures in its 2013 immigration report noted a spike in the immigration-related legislation introduced by states to 253, from 111 in 2012. Many bills sought to extend in-state tuition to children brought to the U.S. by undocumented parents and to issue driver's licenses to undocumented workers. Court challenges of hard-line immigration enforcement legislation of the type Arizona passed in 2010, the NCSL reported, have discouraged states from passing such bills, which \"largely disappeared\" in 2013. Still, a year after the intraparty assessment, the GOP has focused its immediate strategy not on Hispanics and immigration but on President Obama and his health care legislation. (Obama, himself under fire from Hispanic leaders for his administration's aggressive deportation policies, last week sought to placate critics and announced a review of immigration enforcement policies.) Monday's press call came a day after Priebus referred to the health care law as \"complete poison\" and as the party launched what it characterized as a six-figure cable and digital ad buy targeting minorities and young voters in 14 states with contested 2014 Senate races.",

The Pew Research Center's newly-released survey on American millennials has so far been interpreted as the latest demographic disaster confronting the GOP. According to the report, millennials \u2014 defined as Americans aged 18 to 32 \u2014 appear to vote heavily Democratic and hold liberal views on a variety of contemporary political and social issues. The findings, based on a recent Pew Research Center survey and analysis of other Pew surveys conducted between 1990 and 2014, are unquestionably a cause for worry among Republicans. But Democrats shouldn't be too quick to view the survey as unvarnished good news. Here are four reasons why. Millennials Are Less Attached To The Democratic Party Label While Pew characterizes the millennials as \"strikingly Democratic\" in the last two presidential elections, they are nevertheless more likely than previous generations to reject party labels. Half of millennials \u2014 up from 38 percent in 2004 \u2014 identify themselves as political independents, meaning both parties have lost ground among young people. Millennials Are No More Liberal On Gun Control And Abortion Of all the age groups, millennials are the most supportive of same-sex marriage, the legalization of marijuana, and a path to citizenship for undocumented immigrants by a wide margin. But their views on gun control and abortion are no more liberal than previous generations that Pew studied. Forty-nine percent of millennials say it's more important to protect gun rights than control gun ownership, a figure that is roughly at par with the attitudes of older generations. And 56 percent say abortion should be legal in all cases \u2014 slightly less than among Generation X, which is defined as Americans born between 1965 and 1980. Millennials are also much less likely to consider themselves environmentalists than any other generation. Fewer Millennials See Big Differences Between The Parties Just 31 percent of millennials say there is a great deal of difference between the Republican and Democratic parties. That's considerably less than among other generations: By comparison, 58 percent of the so-called Silent Generation (those born between 1928 to 1945) believe there are big differences between the parties. Millennials Are As Skeptical Of Obamacare As Older Generations Even though millennials support universal health insurance by the widest margin of any generation \u2014 and are far more supportive of President Obama than older generations \u2014 their attitude toward the Affordable Care Act is just as negative as older generations: only about four in 10 in each generation approved of the law.",

Assad became president after his father's death in 2000 and is assured of winning a third seven-year term. The Turkish border city of Gaziantep becomes more Syrian by the day. New waves of refugees have arrived since January. In the market, Syrian craftsmen hammer out copper pots and plates, as they did back home in Aleppo. \"We left to save our children,\" says Ali Abu Hassan. \"The bombs come every day.\" Back in Syria, President Bashar Assad is universally expected to win in Tuesday's election, a sign to Hassan and his family that they should expect an indefinite stay in Turkey alongside the swelling ranks of refugees. Turkish officials have now floated a proposal for an eight-year residency permit for Syrians, replacing the one-year card. Last year, Turkey was convinced Assad would go soon. But no one in Turkey is saying that now. All of Syria's neighbors are adjusting policy to the new timeline. The Syrian ballot is taking place during a civil war that's in its fourth year and still raging. Assad won his two previous seven-year presidential terms facing no competition. This time, there are two other names on the ballot, but they are little-known and have no chance. In addition, the voting is only taking place in areas that the Assad regime controls.

At least 2.5 million Syrians have fled their homeland due to the civil war, and millions more have been displaced inside Syria. The election has galvanized international attention, says Josh Landis, a longtime Syria analyst who teaches at the University of Oklahoma. But it is more a message than a vote, to friends and foes alike, he says. \"It has nothing to do with democracy,\" Landis says. \"This is about power, and in showing your enemies that you can make everybody under your control line up and kiss your hand.\" \"It's a fight to the death between Syria's religious minorities and the Sunni majority,\" Landis adds. Assad is a member of the Alawites, an offshoot of Shiite Islam, and they make up a little more than 10 percent of the Syrian population. The Alawites \"feel they could be pushed out. It doesn't matter if Assad is presiding over a broken country,\" Landis says. Assad Still Has Allies The vote comes as Assad weathers the storm with the help of strong allies Russia, Iran and Hezbollah, the Lebanese militant group. His allies also support the election. Russia is sending election monitors. In recent weeks, the city of Homs, which represented the heart of the uprising, was retaken by Assad's army. The election in Homs is a propaganda coup for a regime pledging security and stability. But can the regime deliver? Residents of Homs return to survey the damage to their city on May 27. Three weeks earlier, rebels withdrew under a truce, and government forces retook control. Homs was considered the birthplace of the uprising against Assad, and retaking it was considered an important victory for the government.\n                \n                    \n                    Jonathan S.

Three weeks earlier, rebels withdrew under a truce, and government forces retook control. Homs was considered the birthplace of the uprising against Assad, and retaking it was considered an important victory for the government. Analyst Brian Katulis says that's not likely. After a recent research trip to the region, he says Syria, by all measures, is a failed state. \"It's a very broken country, and it is probably the most disastrous situation the whole world is facing, in terms of the human costs. So it's not a great prize,\" says Katulis, of the Center for American Progress. At an opposition radio station in Gaziantep, Syrian activists are working on songs and reports to broadcast into Syria on election day. There are more than a dozen opposition media outlets supported by the Turks and funded by Western donors, including the United States. The message is, \"Don't vote out of fear.\" But war is more the focus here than the vote. Assad's allies still support a military victory as the regime gains more territory than it loses. That doesn't mean an Assad military victory, however, says Noah Bonsey, an analyst with the International Crisis Group. Overall, the battlefield remains a stalemate, he says. \"The regime is not prepared, and perhaps it's not even capable of making the concessions necessary that would enable it to cash in politically on its military progress,\" he says. Large parts of the country are in ruins, the economic losses are catastrophic, and pro-Assad rallies do not change the facts on the ground, he says. \"After all the media attention has died down, the elections will be over but the war will go on,\" he adds.",

Tuesday's elections in Syria are sure to result in another term for President Bashar Assad, even as the international community says his regime is responsible for the deaths of tens of thousands of civilians. The opposition is railing against his inevitable triumph. At a demonstration Friday by some of the 1 million Syrians who have fled into neighboring Lebanon, the view on the election was clear. \"What elections?\" says Mohamad al-Zain, a refugee in the dusty Lebanese border town of Arsal. \"They're blood elections. Are we going to vote for the one who killed our children and made us homeless, exiled us, made us immigrants?\" Zain says there are more than 100,000 refugees in Arsal, and not one of them will vote. Angry voices agree, like Abdelmaati al-Kareem. \"All the elections are a failure,\" Kareem says. \"Never in a lifetime will he win, and he'll fail, with God's will.\" The force of this rage is evident across the spectrum of Assad's opponents. They say they can't believe, after three years of revolution-turned-civil war, the president is set for re-election. From the city of Aleppo, amid rubble where the opposition groups say government airstrikes have killed 2,000 people this year, campaigners record responses to the elections. \"We haven't experienced anything like democracy for the last 40 years \u2014 are they fooling us in the name of democracy?\" one unidentified woman asks. There's also an outpouring of bleak satire. One fake poster shows Assad as Mafia boss Don Corleone, with the two token candidates running against him kissing his hand. Another entreats voters to pick Iranian military chief Qassem Sleimani for president \u2014 a reference to Iranian support for Assad. A satirical campaign poster encourages a vote for Iran's military chief, alluding to Iran's support for Assad.\n                \n\n                    Naame Shaam\n                    \n\nhide caption The Western-backed political opposition urges people not to vote. \"We boycotted the elections completely,\" says Khalid Saleh, spokesman for the main opposition coalition, speaking from Istanbul. \"We know that they're a sham, not real. Everybody is wondering whether Assad is going to win by 99.8 or 99.9 percent.\" Saleh adds that armed rebels aligned with his group say they won't target pro-Assad rallies or polling stations. But even though opposition factions all condemn the election, they are fragmented and polarized. There are signs that extremists among them will target civilians who vote. At a pro-Assad rally earlier in the month in the southern town of Deraa, children danced among Assad posters. Then, rockets hit the event. Over footage of the dying and the dead, state television condemns the attack, \"done in the name of revolution.\" Extremists have announced on social media that they plan similar attacks on rallies and polling stations. In the northern city of Idlib, footage showed civilians streaming out of the city because they believe Islamist fighters may attack during the election. But the regime is undeterred. Pro-Assad rallies continue in streets plastered with his picture. On Saturday, the Foreign Ministry announced that expatriates had already voted in 43 embassies worldwide. Turnout, the ministry says, was 95 percent.",

            "article_content": "1 of 6 Every afternoon, Father Ayoub Stefan leads prayers at St. Gabriel's Syrian Orthodox Church in Sodertalje, a hilly, wooded city of factories and apartment buildings about 20 miles southwest of Stockholm. The slight, bespectacled priest moved here six years ago from Qamishli, a city in northeastern Syria. In the past three years, as civil war has torn apart Father Ayoub's homeland, it seems like everyone from Qamishli has wanted to come to Sodertalje. People call or email or write him on Facebook every week, all asking the same questions: \"How can we come to Sweden? How can we come to Sodertalje? Can you help us get there? We are desperate.\" \"I always say, 'I am sorry, I can't help you,' \" he says. \"I can only pray for you.\" Yet many are arriving every day, often after paying thousands of dollars to smugglers. Sweden's migration board projects that 95,000 people, many of them refugees from Syria, are expected to arrive in 2015. That would be a record in this country of 10 million people, which already has taken in more refugees, relative to its population, than any other country in Europe. But the arrival of so many refugees is testing the country's famously tolerant identity. Swedes voted out centrist Prime Minister Frederik Reinfeldt this September after he gave a speech asking people to \"open their hearts\" to those fleeing war. Instead, an anti-immigrant party, the Sweden Democrats, won seats in parliament and helped bring down the center-left government of Prime Minister Stefan Lofven earlier this week. One member of the Sweden Democrats, Linus Byland, told reporters they would fight any government proposal that would increase funding for immigration. Sodertalje Mayor Boel Godner in her office.

The city has been extremely welcoming to immigrants, but services are now strained. \"What's going to happen to everyone who comes here?

What's going to happen to everyone who comes here? No one has given the answer to that yet.\" New elections are set for March. They will be closely watched in Sodertalje, which takes pride in claiming that it welcomed more Iraqi refugees after the 2003 U.S. invasion and subsequent war than all of North America. Even by Swedish standards, Sodertalje has been exceptionally welcoming to refugees. Most are Syrian Christians. Assyrians \u2014 or Christians from Iraq, Turkey and Syria \u2014 have been moving to the city since the first wave of refugees began coming to Sweden in the 1970s. That's when Afram Yakoub's parents left Qamishli. \"In the U.S., you always say that it's the land of dreams, yeah? I say it's actually Sweden,\" says Yakoub, who's now chairman of the Assyrian Community of Sweden. \"Here you can get an education from kindergarten up to university without paying one cent. Society takes care of you because the social welfare system is good. Generally, it's an open society with good values.\" Sodertalje now has five Syrian Orthodox churches, two professional soccer teams, and a TV channel that broadcasts in Neo-Aramaic, Arabic and English to eighty countries. One third of the city's population \u2014 30,000 out of 90,00 people \u2014 now hails from all around the Middle East, says city manager Martin Andreae. \"It's such a big group, with the same background,\" says Andreae. \"And they come to one specific place. It makes a lot of effort to organize integration in a good way.\" Integration begins with housing, and there's a huge shortage in Sweden and especially in Sodertalje. Refugees in the city crowd into small apartments with relatives and friends, says Johan Ward, an immigration specialist at the municipality of Sodertalje. \"You've got a situation where there are several families living in a one-bedroom apartment because there are literally no available flats in Sodertalje,\" he says. \"And it's a problem that is increasing every year, as more people come here.\" Sodertalje's unemployment rate is twice as high as Sweden's national rate. That's partly because refugees are struggling to learn Swedish, a requirement for a job. Maria Silen sees this firsthand as a teacher an adult language school in Sodertalje, her hometown. On a recent evening, she listens as one of her newest students, a refugee from Syria, speaks in halting Swedish about the smugglers who brought him to Europe. \"The most difficult is for them to find places where they can use their Swedish,\" she says. \"Because wherever they go, everybody speaks Arabic. So even if the newcomers \u2014 they try to speak Swedish, but they will meet people who speak Arabic.\" Andreae, Sodertalje's city manager, says he hopes Swedish politicians find concrete ways to manage immigration instead of closing its doors to war refugees. He would like to see other municipalities take in more refugees, for example, since Sodertalje's resources are now stretched. He says he chose to work in Sodertalje in part because it reflects Sweden's openness to the world. He hopes that doesn't change. \"Because I like to think that the Swedes still are a very tolerant people,\" he says. \"But of course, when you are challenged in that view, when things are happening, that situation can move, and it can move quite rapidly.\" You can follow Joanna Kakissis on Twitter @joannakakissis.

When Syrian President Bashar Assad was re-elected for a third term in office this week \u2014 in a tightly controlled election in which official results showed 87.7 percent of voters supported him \u2014 it demonstrated Assad's confidence, even three years after much of the country rose against him. Opposition activists say the election was a cruel farce that locks the country into a path of war; many admit they are exhausted and discouraged. \"I don't blame people for voting,\" says Aboud Dandachi, an activist in exile in Istanbul. \"That is the fear that the regime has implanted in us for 40 years. If you step out of line there will be repercussions that you can't even imagine.\" Dandachi has learned to cope with the help of a popular British TV show, Doctor Who.

He has made himself an expert, he says, on the parallels between the Syrian revolt and the themes of Doctor Who, a program that feature a doctor, a British phone booth and time travel. The 38-year-old, a self-described computer geek writes From Homs to Istanbul, a blog about the war. In February this year he published an e-book: The Doctor, The Eye Doctor and Me. (Assad was trained as an ophthalmologist.) \"People can't relate to Syria unless it's something they care about,\" he says, explaining his reason for focusing on the popular British show. \"Honestly, my life was reduced to living for the next episode of Doctor Who,\" he says with a laugh, remembering binge-watching the series. \"Every day I would pray that nothing happened to the Internet so I could down load the episodes.\" In the spring of 2011, Dandachi was caught up in the revolt in the city of Homs, which became the capital of the revolt. Thousands chanted for freedom, led by young activists, convinced Assad's days were numbered. Break the wall of fear, they believed, and the oppressive regime would topple, too. \"We were definitely na\u00efve,\" he says about the peaceful movement he joined. \"When we said freedom, (it) was just shorthand for lots of things we wanted to change, lots of things that we couldn't articulate.\" As the rallies grew, the regime crackdown hardened. Dandachi witnessed friends gunned down in the streets. In April, security police killed more than 100 protesters. His brother could have been one of those casualties, but he had left the rally to charge his cellphone. At the beginning (Doctor Who) had so many enemies, in the end there was only one. All it comes down to in a war is resilience. We overestimated how committed our side is, and we underestimated how committed the people around Bashar were. Aboud Dandachi, a Syrian opposition activist in exile Shocked by the violence, Dandachi contacted the BBC to report. In one of his last interviews from Homs in January 2012, the gunfire is so loud that the interviewer tells him, \"If you are in an unsafe position, obviously, get off the line.\" His voice shaking, Aboud replies: \"I'm fine. I'm fine.\" Even now, the memory of that broadcast makes his heart race. \"Don't be a coward,\" he repeated to himself to keep up his nerve. By then, the protest had become an armed rebellion. Al-Qaida had set up camp in Syria. Dandachi fled to the relative safety of the coastal city of Tartous. For him, it was \"enemy territory\" \u2014 Tartous is a city of regime supporters. But he understood their fears. \"A bad dictator can stay in place if there are no alternatives,\" he says. \"I understand people who are apprehensive and stuck.\" Dandachi rented a small hotel room, staying in Tartous for 18 months. \"I didn't mix with anyone,\" he says, instead, downloading Doctor Who broadcasts. He was trying to make sense out of the chaos and the random nature of death in a brutally relentless war. It was also a way to stay sane. \"I cannot think of any time in my life that I was so engaged and tried to find so much meaning,\" Dandachi says. The television show became an inspiration. In one episode, the main character prevails in a war that lasted 300 years. \"At the beginning he had so many enemies, in the end there was only one. All it comes down to in a war is resilience,\" Dandachi says in a bitter critique of the movement for change. \"We overestimated how committed our side is, and we underestimated how committed the people around Bashar were.\" For 18 months while Dandachi lived in the Syrian city of Tartous \u2014 an Assad stronghold \u2014 he says he watched Doctor Who as a way to make sense out of the war and as a way to stay sane.\n                \n                    \n                    Jodi Hilton for NPR\n                    \n                \nhide caption This week, Dandachi watched that commitment in an election mounted only in the parts of Syria controlled by the regime. After the vote, Assad declared a mandate for Syria to manage its own affairs, ending hopes for a political solution to the war. It was election theater, says Dandachi, not a real choice. Even hard-line opponents inside Syria voted for Assad, fearing retribution, he says. \"That is the fear that the regime has implanted in us for 40 years, that if you step out of line there will be repercussions that you can't even image,\" he says. But Dandachi is unsparing about the failures of opposition, citing another lesson from the show: The hero is a skilled politician. \"Syria is what happens when a society has no political class worth a damn. Armies can fight wars forever, they can win battles, but without a political solution for framework to end the conflict, then you can keep fighting forever,\" he says. Forever is only in science fiction. But Dandachi and many other activists say it is unlikely they can return home for years; becoming another generation in exile, trying to build a credible political movement.",

            "article_content": "To Pakistan, the Afghan elections and the withdrawal of most U.S. troops seems reminiscent of the Soviet departure decades ago \u2014 leaving Afghanistan in Pakistan's lap, for better or worse.  AUDIE CORNISH, HOST: From NPR News, this is ALL THINGS CONSIDERED. I'm Audie Cornish. MELISSA BLOCK, HOST: And I'm Melissa Block. If there's trouble in Afghanistan, there'll be trouble in Pakistan, too, and vice versa; so the saying goes. Afghanistan is still awaiting results from its election last week, but it's a milestone toward the drawdown of U.S. troops there. Pakistanis worry about whether that will be followed by a spike in Afghan violence that spills over the border. NPR's Philip Reeves reports from Islamabad. PHILIP REEVES, BYLINE: Doctors in this hospital are at full stretch. Men lie on iron beds beneath whirring fans. They have bleeding and bandaged limbs, and skin pocked by shrapnel wounds. These are the victims of the deadliest attack in Pakistan's capital for more than five years, a bomb in a vegetable market that killed 24 people Wednesday. Ghulam Sarwa, a retired electrician, is visiting a wounded relative. Everyone's on edge, he says. GHULAM SARWA: (Through interpreter) It creates tension. People get concerned. Poor people get concerned, so it creates a sort of anxiety. REEVES: Pakistan has long been gripped by anxiety. Now, there are fears there'll be more bloodshed after the drawdown of U.S. forces from Afghanistan. Not long ago, a group of Pakistani politicians and pundits gathered in Islamabad's Marriott hotel. They came to discuss Afghanistan with a visiting NATO delegation. IMRAN ZAFAR LEGHARI: Sorry, I'm being a little bit emotional here. I'm really sorry. REEVES: Imran Zafar Leghari, a Pakistani parliamentarian, addressed the gathering. LEGARI: I don't see any stability in Afghanistan. Is you going from Afghanistan or now? That's your issue. But I want my country to be in peace. REEVES: Pakistan has not forgotten the Soviet exit from Afghanistan in 1989. The United States used Pakistan as a launching pad to win that final chapter in the Cold War. Pakistanis say the U.S. then walked away, abandoning them in a neighborhood awash with militants, guns and refugees. NATO representative Nicholas Williams told the gathering, no one's walking away this time. NICHOLAS WILLIAMS: The international community as a whole recognize that as much progress as Afghanistan has made, it still needs help and support beyond 2014. REEVES: Pakistanis don't have much trust in the international community. Many worry there'll be another civil war in Afghanistan like the 1990s; that the Afghan Taliban and the Pakistani Taliban will join forces, and Pakistan will face even more violence. Mushahid Hussain Sayed chairs the Pakistani Senate's defense committee. He's hopeful history won't repeat itself, but he has concerns. MUSHAHID HUSSAIN SAYED: If there is no inter-Afghan dialogue, if there is no peace process, if there's a vacuum, that would be disastrous. Its tremors will be felt not just in Islamabad, but they might have a resonance as far away as Europe and North America. REEVES: The picture's complicated by the role played by Pakistan. Pakistani officials privately acknowledge their intelligence agencies have covertly supported militant groups in Afghanistan, including the Taliban. Rashed Rehman, editor of The Daily Times, says Pakistan's been intervening there for 40 years. RASHED REHMAN: It still continues. After all, the Taliban, Haqqani network are sitting on Pakistani soil, operating across the border. That's something we like to brush under the carpet and not be reminded of. REEVES: This impulse to mess with the next-door neighbor is partly driven by Pakistan's anxiety about its old foe, India. The Indians have good relations with Kabul. Pakistanis fear what some call the nutcracker scenario - being caught between two hostile neighbors, India to the east, and a pro-India Afghanistan to the west. Pakistan's government says it's now concluded stability in Afghanistan is crucial for Pakistan, so it won't be interfering anymore. TARIQ FATEMI: Whatever policy may have been followed in the past, as of now, we shall scrupulously maintain a policy of total noninterference in the domestic affairs. REEVES: Tariq Fatemi is a top foreign affairs adviser to Pakistan's prime minister, Nawaz Sharif. FATEMI: We have recognized that this policy was harmful to us. It was harmful to the neighbors, and it was harmful to the entire region. We have learned our lessons. We want to stay away from it and instead, we want to reach out. REEVES: Back in the hospital, electrician Ghulam Sarwa is sure of only one thing. SARWA: (Speaking foreign language) REEVES: He says the situation is going to get worse and the Taliban, stronger.

            "article_content": "Nicaragua is unique in Central America for its low crime rate as well as how few Nicaraguan migrants make the trip north to the U.S. Why is Nicaragua bucking the regional trends?  DAVID GREENE, HOST: The U.S. immigration system sometimes has welcomed Central Americans fleeing violence. Consider Nicaragua, where NPR's Carrie Kahn has been reporting recently. Many people fled the country during its war in the 1980s. CARRIE KAHN, BYLINE: Most of the immigrants that have come from Nicaragua to the U.S. were political refugees during the time of the Sandinista war with the U.S.-backed Contras, so they got political asylum. They came legally and came as whole families. A lot of what's driving the current phenomenon is family reunification - these kids want to get back together with father or mother or a family member in the U.S. Nicaraguan families came together. GREENE: That history helps explain why Nicaragua isn't producing that many child migrants today. Carrie Kahn says that's just one way Nicaragua is different from other Central American countries. KAHN: The escape valve for Nicaragua is to the south. It's Costa Rica. It's not to the U.S. It's not that Nicaraguans aren't leaving Nicaragua - they are. It is one of the poorest countries in the region and recently - I think two days ago I was just by the Costa Rican Embassy here and the line to get a visa was about 300 long - hours you wait in line. GREENE: It's interesting, Carrie Kahn, because you're bringing up a lot of differences and issues that I didn't expect you necessarily to talk about. I was thinking more of something like, the murder rate. Is Nicaragua not plagued by the kind of gang and organized crime violence that has been driving some of these kids away from places like Honduras? KAHN: Definitely that is a factor. Also the police here is very different, and that has a lot to do with the socialist model of the Sandinistas - of the political regime that is in power right now. There's a lot of remnants from that. Neighborhoods are more organized. They have more community policing models and so they've never really adopted the strong-arm policing like in El Salvador or Honduras. GREENE: It sounds like, Carrie, that there might be some lessons in terms of policing that some of the other countries might be able to take here. KAHN: Well, it's a political instrument of the regime and so there are some troubling aspects of that you have to keep in mind. There is a consolidation of power Nicaragua that is unlike anything in Central America, and that's through the President Daniel Ortega. There was an incident here just this last month where there was a bus in northern Nicaragua that was attacked by armed groups. Five people were killed and dozens were injured. That is not something we see here in Nicaragua. There is talk that this was drug traffickers sending a message to the government they are here are working in Nicaragua. This has given the regime the opportunity to have political vendettas and 12 people have been disappeared. So there's a - there's a change in the situation here in Nicaragua and it has put people on edge. [POST-BROADCAST CORRECTION: Human rights advocates in Nicaragua, including Nicaragua's Permanent Commission on Human Rights (Cenidh), had accused masked police officers of breaking down doors in the northern city of Matagalpa, arresting suspects without warrants and not providing due process to 12 people during the investigation into the bus attack. But 12 people were not \"disappeared.\" Eight men who had been taken into custody were publicly identified on Aug. 8. During an initial court appearance on Aug. 13, a judge in Managua ruled there is enough evidence to proceed with the case against the eight men who face the most serious charges. The judge denied the suspects' request to dismiss the case because of alleged human rights violations.] GREENE: So, Carrie Kahn, it's a very complicated picture here. We don't want to suggest that people are not leaving Nicaragua - that is clearly happening. This is a very poor country with a lot of challenges as you say, but I wonder if this suggests there's some sort of reality in this region that there has to be choice. If you want to keep a country safer, have a lower murder rate, have less gang violence - you have to have something closer to a police state, a leader who's going to consolidate power. KAHN: Well, clearly the state here in Nicaragua is much stronger than it is in any of Nicaragua's northern neighbors. What we've seen is an economic growth in Nicaragua that is growing at about 4 percent per year. That is not seen any of the other counties, and the crime rate, as we've said, is much lower. But human rights advocates and small opposition here in Nicaragua are very concerned about this strong state here. There's a lot of contention about the recent elections and there's huge consolidation of power by the president. He just took over the police, he took over the military and he has clamped down on the opposition. GREENE: All right, NPR's Carrie Kahn reporting from Nicaragua. Carrie, thanks a lot. KAHN: You're welcome. Copyright \u00a9 2014 NPR.  All rights reserved.  Visit our website terms of use and permissions pages at www.npr.org for further information.

            "article_content": "Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan used 2014 to assert new powers but found no clear path for handling the militant threat next door in Syrian and Iraq.  DAVID GREENE, HOST: Turkey has always played a pivotal role in NATO as the alliance's only majority Muslim country. And with crises brewing in its neighborhood this year, Turkey's role has never been more important. But 2014 saw growing alarm at the  curious behavior and aggressive moves by the President Recep Tayyip Erdogan. NPR's Peter Kenyon reports on Erdogan's year and where Turks think their country might be headed. PETER KENYON, BYLINE: In August, Erdogan ended a 12-year run as prime minister and became the country's first popularly-elected president. He made it clear that the role of a ceremonial president was not for him and began exercising powers his predecessors never used. Not everyone cheered. (SOUNDBITE OF PROTEST) KENYON: Street protests against Erdogan's policies continued, but harsh crackdowns by riot police ensured they never gained momentum. This rally, posted online, took place on International Women's Day. At a women's justice conference later in the year, Erdogan told a startled audience that women may deserve justice but they can never be equal to men. (SOUNDBITE OF SPEECH) PRESIDENT RECEP TAYYIP ERDOGAN: (Through translator) You cannot bring man and woman down to equal levels. It's against the creation. Their nature and bodies are clearly different. In a workplace, you cannot hold a pregnant woman and a man to the same standards and conditions. KENYON: Some of his pronouncements reflected the ruling party's agenda of promoting Islam and celebrating the Ottoman Empire. Erdogan seemed intent on rewriting history when he told a gathering of Latin American Muslim leaders that Muslims discovered the Americas well before Christopher Columbus. (SOUNDBITE OF SPEECH) ERDOGAN: (Through translator) 314 years before Columbus, in 1178, Muslim sailors reached the American continent. Moreover, in his memoirs Christopher Columbus mentioned seeing a mosque on the hills of Cuba. It would be nice to have a mosque there today, as well. KENYON: Historians disagree over whether Columbus discovered America, but they do agree there was no mosque on the hills of Cuba when he showed up. These and other remarks began to raise troubling questions - is Turkey still a reliable NATO ally? Is a model Muslim democracy becoming just another repressive state in a region that has too many of those already? On the streets of Istanbul, Turks were also asking another question - what's going on with our president? BORCU ALTINTAS: I think there is nothing to comment on. It's nonsense. I'm so sorry to say this about one of the presidents of Turkey's Republic, but I don't know what he's doing really. KENYON: 35-year-old Borcu Altintas grew up believing Turkey would remain on the modern path set out by the Republic's first president, Mustafa Kemal Ataturk. She never imagined having to explain to her daughters why the new president says women can never be equal to men. ALTINTAS: And now he's trying to form a male-dominant society. And as Turkish women, I believe we will not let him to do this. We'll not obey, better to say. KENYON: Altintas still calls Ataturk her eternal leader, which brings us to an interesting aspect of this story. Western commentators like to compare Erdogan to another strongman - Russia's Vladimir Putin. But Turks know the man he most resembles is Ataturk, the charismatic autocrat who westernized the new Turkish Republic by force. Turks old enough to remember that Ataturk forced history students to be taught that Turkey is the cradle of human civilization recognized echoes of that past in Erdogan's claims about Muslims in America. By year's end, Erdogan's government had rounded up dozens of opposition journalists, and an arrest warrant was issued for Erdogan's former ally-turned-rival, the U.S.-based Islamic scholar Fethullah Gulen. Erdogan also described birth control as treason, advising one couple at their wedding that having only one child would be strange. Barely noticed in the blizzard of controversy, says author and columnist Mustafa Akyol, was Erdogan's move to expand his presidential advisers to the point that they constitute a de facto shadow government. MUSTAFA AKYOL: Indeed, I think Erdogan is creating facts on the ground, establishing his role as a dominant person who really defines a narrative in a country. KENYON: If Turkey is indeed heading away from Ataturk's enforced secular Turkish nationalism toward what Akyol calls Erdogan's enforced Muslim nationalism, 2015's parliamentary elections may give a clue as to what Turks think about all that.

            "article_content": "Scottish voters have rejected independence, deciding to remain part of the United Kingdom after a historic referendum that shook the country to its core. The decision prevented a rupture of a 307-year union with England, bringing a huge sigh of relief to the British political establishment. Scots voted 55 percent to 45 percent against independence in a vote that saw an unprecedented turnout. A majority of voters did not embrace Scottish First Minister Alex Salmond's impassioned plea to launch a new state, choosing instead the security offered by remaining in the United Kingdom. Salmond conceded defeat, saying \"we know it is a majority for the No campaign\" and called on Scots to accept the results of the vote. He said the voted \"has been triumph for the democratic process.\" Salmond had argued that Scots could go it alone because of its extensive oil reserves and high levels of ingenuity and education. He said Scotland would flourish on its own, free of interference from any London-based government. Nonetheless, the skilled 59-year-old leader of the Scottish National Party came close to winning independence \u2014 his long-cherished goal \u2014 and still won a promise of new powers for Scotland from rattled London politicians. Many saw it as a \"heads versus hearts\" campaign, with cautious older Scots concluding that independence would be too risky financially, while younger ones were enamored with the idea of building their own country. The result saves British Prime Minister David Cameron from a historic defeat and also helps opposition chief Ed Miliband by keeping his many Labour Party lawmakers in Scotland in place. His party would have found it harder to win a national election in 2015 without that support from Scotland. Former Prime Minister Gordon Brown, a Scot, returned to prominence with a dramatic barnstorming campaign in support of the union in the final days before the referendum vote. Brown argued passionately that Scots could be devoted to Scotland but still proud of their place in the United Kingdom, rejecting the argument that independence was the patriotic choice. \"There is not a cemetery in Europe that does not have Scots, English, Welsh and Irish lined side by side,\" Brown said in his final speech before the vote. \"We not only won these wars together, we built the peace together. What we have built together by sacrificing and sharing, let no narrow nationalism split asunder.\" For his part, Cameron \u2014 aware that his Conservative Party is widely loathed in Scotland \u2014 begged voters not to use a vote for independence as a way to bash his party. The vote against independence keeps the U.K. from losing a substantial part of its territory and oil reserves and prevents it from having to find a new base for its nuclear arsenal, now housed in Scotland. It had also faced a possible loss of influence within international institutions including the 28-nation European Union and the United Nations. The decision also means Britain can avoid a prolonged period of financial insecurity that had been predicted by some if Scotland broke away. In return for staying in the union, Scotland's voters have been promised significant \u2014 though somewhat unspecified \u2014 new powers by the British government, which had feared losing Scotland forever.",

However, newly empowered Hindu nationalists are asserting their ideology and agenda. There are signs of rising tensions between India's Hindu and Muslim communities since Narendra Modi, a self-avowed Hindu nationalist, took power as prime minister in May. Most of the small skirmishes have played out in India's largest state, Uttar Pradesh, or UP. There, Hindu nationalists from Modi's BJP Party have seized on charges of an alleged forced religious conversion to say that Hindu India is under siege. District party leader Sanjay Prajapati says the Muslim community has harmed the Hindu community, India's largest. \"They aim to convert our daughters to Islam because they feel they can increase their population,\" he says. \"And if we continue to be tortured by them, we'll soon be their slaves. To force conversion [to Islam] is more than a crime \u2014 it is a sin, and we have a duty to stop it.\" One case in particular is drawing attention. There are competing claims about what may have happened at a small Muslim school, or madrassa, in the mixed Muslim-Hindu village of Sarawa, where the sewage and the water buffalo run openly in the streets. A 20-year-old Hindu woman who taught at the madrassa is at the center of the murky charges that she was gang-raped and forcibly converted to Islam in July. The woman was hospitalized, and her father filed a police report alleging that leaders of the madrassa were the culprits. Muslim leaders say the madrassa has been maligned. There have been several arrests. While police say inconsistent statements have impeded the investigation, political polarization has been unchecked. Sanjay Prajapati says the adrenaline of Modi's recent victory has inspired the anti-conversion campaigners who, he says, feel emboldened after years on the fringe. \"There is new energy and Modi is the source ... There is new vigor in our organizations after being on the verge of dying,\" he says. Prajapati goes on to say the Muslim community \"is under fear. There is not a single Muslim parliamentarian from the state of Uttar Pradesh,\" the BJP activist says, adding that \"the congratulations for that belong to Modi.\" While there are new signs of friction, India has had communal tensions in the past involving Hindus, Muslims, Sikhs and others in the tremendously diverse nation. The RSS, the ideological source of Hindu nationalism, practices dawn drills in a suburban Delhi park. Volunteers rehearse calisthenics, sing patriotic songs and salute their saffron flag as part of their pledge to protect India against potential dangers.\n                \n                    \n                    Julie McCarthy/NPR\n                    \n                \nhide caption The RSS, the ideological source of Hindu nationalism, practices dawn drills in a suburban Delhi park. Volunteers rehearse calisthenics, sing patriotic songs and salute their saffron flag as part of their pledge to protect India against potential dangers. Modi has called for a 10-year \"moratorium\" on religious clashes, saying that inter-religious conflict is sowing social strife and hurting India's development, the promise of which got Modi elected. \"How long will these evils continue? Whom does it benefit? Friends look around and you will find that nobody has benefited from it. I appeal to all that whether it is the poison of casteism, communalism, regionalism, discrimination on social and economic issues \u2014 all these are obstacles to our way forward,\" Modi said in an Aug. 15 speech marking India's Independence Day. Modi's party is the political branch of a family of Hindu nationalist groups that includes the RSS. Formed in the 1920s to fight British rule, the RSS is regarded as the ideological fount of Hindu nationalism, and the BJP's ideological parent. Modi is a lifelong member. Author and journalist Nilanjan Mukhopadhyay says the RSS swears by \"cultural nationalism.\" \"That means it is steeped in Hindu-ness, which is distinct from Hindu the religion,\" Mukhopadhyay says. The RSS says Hinduism is not a religion but a \"way of life,\" encompassed in the term \"Hindutva.\" A compendium of Hindu values, virtues, customs and history that the RSS says binds India in a shared heritage. This month RSS Chief Mohan Bhagwat angered religious minorities when he insisted that every Indian was subordinate to Hindutva. \"The entire world knows that the people who live in India are Hindus. Just as the Germans have Germany, the English have England, and Americans have America. ... All the people of this country are Hindus,\" Bhagwat said. Champat Rai is a leader of the VHP, another group that subscribes to the tenants of Hindutva. Rai says religious minorities in India all have deep Hindu roots. \"All Muslims and Christians living in India today \u2014 at some point their forefathers were Hindus. Muslims invaded India and used the sword to convert,\" Rai says, referring to the Mughal Dynasty that ruled India for 300 years. \"So you can go to a church or a mosque, but respect Indian festivals, values and India as the motherland.\" Muslims, however, do freely participate in the festivities of Hindus. Nilanjan Mukhopadhyay, whose book is titled Narendra Modi: The Man, The Times, says the RSS and Modi have nursed the idea of India as a wounded civilization in need of restoring: \"Restoring lost dignity and the pride of Hindus, seeking revenge and taking back India to its days of glory.\" He says they treat India as the metaphorical \"golden bird at one point, but being looted and plundered by Muslim rulers and invaders who came to India.\" In re-balancing the perceived historical imbalance, Modi himself has been accused of marginalizing Muslims. He was also accused of standing by during Hindu-Muslim riots that killed mostly Muslims in his state in 2002. The allegation was never proven but still stirs anxiety among some of India's 176 million Muslims. Mukhopadhyay says Hindu nationalists aim to create a Hindu Rashtra, or state, and have used strong-arm tactics before. The impoverished village of Sarawa is one of many in India's largest state, Uttar Pradesh, where tensions are reportedly rising between Hindus and Muslims. Hindu nationalists are angry over the alleged rape and forced religious conversion of a Hindu girl in the mixed Hindu-Muslim village.\n                \n                    \n                    Julie McCarthy/NPR\n                    \n                \nhide caption The impoverished village of Sarawa is one of many in India's largest state, Uttar Pradesh, where tensions are reportedly rising between Hindus and Muslims. Hindu nationalists are angry over the alleged rape and forced religious conversion of a Hindu girl in the mixed Hindu-Muslim village. \"There definitely have been instances in the past with the RSS, and its leaders have been very intolerant towards people practicing other religions, targeting people from religious communities in riots and other forms of violent action,\" he says. The RSS has been banned three times, once after the assassination of Mahatma Gandhi. A former RSS member fired the shots that killed him six months after Indian independence in 1947. The RSS was later cleared. A disciplined force, the RSS can be spotted in dawn drills of the sort that shaped a young Modi. In suburban Delhi one weekday, 25 RSS disciples, some dressed in the signature khaki shorts, rehearsed exercises, saluted their saffron flag and sang patriotic songs. The purpose: Defend India against dangers and in times of natural disasters. RSS volunteer Rishabh Toshniwal says that with some 40,000 branches, the group exists to serve, not antagonize, and bears no animus toward the Muslim community \"Hinduism is the most tolerant religion in the world,\" he says. \"Hindu[s] never attacked any other part of the world. Muslims have done it. Sometimes Christians economically have done it. But Hindus haven't. So nobody has to worry about Modi.\" But political scientist Zoya Hasan says Hindu nationalists like the RSS foment division. For example, she says, there's no evidence to show any sizable conversion of Hindus to Christianity or Islam. A former member of the National Commission for Minorities, Hasan says the RSS challenges anyone who dares see India as anything but a Hindu state. \"This is really an attempt to establish dominance \u2014 the dominance of Hinduism and Hindu-ization of society,\" Hasan says. Biographer Mukhopadhyay says Modi is no religious zealot, and if need be will distance himself from the very organization that helped him take power. \"He will utilize religion to acquire political power,\" he says. \"But if it comes to making a choice between acquiring political power or launching or leading a religious crusade, he will opt for political power. There will be a tug of war between the RSS and Modi.\" Rupam Jain Nair contributed to this report. You can follow NPR's New Delhi correspondent Julie McCarthy on Twitter @JulieMcCarthyJM.",

The country is also experiencing growing anti-Semitism that has Jewish leaders worried.  SCOTT SIMON, HOST: And the far right is poised to do well in Hungary's EU election tomorrow. Candidates blame the EU for many of that country's problems. NPR's Soraya Sarhaddi Nelson reports from Budapest. SORAYA SARHADDI NELSON, BYLINE: To many Hungarians, a half-finished World War II monument next to a popular fountain in downtown Budapest highlights the extremist tenor of politics in this former East Bloc country. The plan centerpieces a 25-foot statue of the German Imperial Eagle attacking the Archangel Gabriel. It's supposed to symbolize the Nazi occupation of Hungary 70 years ago. Jewish leaders complained the statue whitewashes history by portraying Hungary as a victim rather than a collaborator with Adolf Hitler and the Holocaust. MIRCEA CHERNOV: It's a very simplistic way to approach this very complex and historic time. NELSON: That's Mircea Chernov, who heads the Haver Foundation, a Jewish group that tries to combat prejudice in Hungary. CHERNOV: Actually everything that happened in Hungary after the World War I, it's denied. NELSON: A dozen or so stern-looking policeman guard the shrouded construction site. They film visitors who stop to look at faded Holocaust Era photos and letters left in front of the monument in silent protest. The intimidating police presence irks Chernov. CHERNOV: There are a number of questions raised with this approach, especially nowadays when there is a raising for the radical right. NELSON: Other civic leaders, as well as analysts and politicians NPR interviewed, say that growing shift to the right is being driven by politicians who have convinced Hungarians that their travails are the fault of the European Union. Staunch nationalism in conflict with Brussels and foreign business interests play well with fed up voters. Their support, coupled with controversial changes to Hungary's voting system, strengthened the ruling Fidesz party's iron grip here following elections last month. Those elections also boosted Hungary's ultranationalist Jobbik party, which was founded in 2003 and is widely criticized for anti-Semitic and racist rhetoric. The roughly 20 percent in votes they got last time is what they are expected to get tomorrow in European Parliament elections. Szabolcs Pogonyi is an assistant professor in nationalism studies at Central European University in Budapest. He says Jobbik is more frightening than other Eurosceptic parties accused of being racist. SZABOLCS POGONYI: It's more dangerous because the Jobbik targets the deprived minorities within the country - the Roma, first and foremost, whereas their Western European counterparts are targeting the immigrants. NELSON: The professor adds Jobbik's success has radicalized even mainstream political dialogue in Hungary. One of the party's key spokesmen is Marton Gyongyosi, who is vice-chairman of the Hungarian Parliament's Foreign Affairs Committee. He was criticized some years back when he demanded Jewish government officials in Hungary disclose whether they had Israeli citizenship. He defends his party's often inflammatory approach as a way of countering the, quote, \"washing away of traditional values.\" MARTON GYONGYOSI: If we continue to sweep all these problems and issues under the carpet, then we can forget about the future of Europe. NELSON: But Jobbik has nevertheless cut down on its verbal attacks on Jews and other minorities, a strategy which some analysts believe is aimed at attracting more support from Hungary's middle and upper class. The spokesman, Gyongyosi, a multilingual 37-year-old with gelled hair who wears jeans and fashionable eyewear is clearly part of the makeover. He says there's no contradiction in his party running for the European Parliament while pushing for Hungary to leave the European Union. GYONGYOSI: It's a legitimate question, but I think you have to sit there at the table to express your ideas and to contribute to a change. I mean, we represent those people who want to see the European Union go into a different direction. NELSON: He adds his party is determined to show Hungarians how being part of the European Union over the past decade has hurt their country. Professor Pogonyi agrees that Hungarians had high expectations when they joined the EU and that many of those expectations haven't been met. Wages here are still very low compared to Western Europe, and benefits from an integrated European economy are slow in coming. Pogonyi says Jobbik inflames Hungarian anger by loudly accusing the EU of robbing their country of its national identity and distracting them with insignificant issues, for example, the rules governing the making of Hungary's famous brandy, called Palinka. POGONYI: People from Brussels coming here and telling Hungarian rural people how much Palinka they can through a year without paying taxes. Is this really such a big issue? NELSON: As a result, analysts predict tomorrow's polls will be more of a protest vote, with a low turnout favoring the ruling party and Jobbik. Soraya Sarhaddi Nelson, NPR News.

            "article_content": "A Million Mutinies Now by V. S. Naipaul Paperback, 521 pages | Your purchase helps support NPR programming. How? On Monday, Narendra Modi will be sworn in as India's prime minister. His rise to power is a remarkable story. A former tea vendor who speaks poor English, Modi is a distinct outsider to India's political and cultural establishment. His election signals the extent to which India is shedding its old hierarchies and class barriers, becoming a more meritocratic society. When I think of what just happened in Indian politics, I think about a book I first read some 24 years ago. That book was India: A Million Mutinies Now, by the Nobel Prize-winning author V.S. Naipaul. Naipaul traveled through India in the late '80s; he wrote before the economic reforms of the '90s, before the social transformations of the new millennium. But Naipaul was prescient. In a series of incisive portraits, he captured the incipient hopes and ambitions of the Indian people. He wrote detailed character sketches of businessmen, stockbrokers, politicians, women breaking free from oppressive traditions. Naipaul described these people \u2014 ordinary people \u2014 finding a new voice and identity. He wrote that they were discovering \"the idea of freedom.\" In many ways, that idea \u2014 a sense of self-confidence, of individual self-expression \u2014 has found shape in Modi's election. Modi's success signals to millions of marginalized Indians that their aspirations are attainable. It's good to remember, though, that the changes Naipaul captured weren't entirely benign. He also wrote of \"rage\" and violence, of disturbances and new social tensions. He wrote of resurgent religious and caste identities that accompanied the new confidence. He worried that the nation and its social fabric could be torn apart. India, he famously observed, was a nation of \"a million little mutinies.\" In much the same way, Modi's rise has two faces. Many are inspired by his victory, but many are also fearful of a new Hindu nationalism, and of worsening relations between India's Hindus and Muslims. Modi will forever be marked by the violent Hindu-Muslim riots that took place in 2002 in the state of Gujarat, where he was chief minister. Many Indian Muslims are insecure about the prospect of a Modi government. Revolutions are rarely simple affairs; mutinies, as Naipaul noted, are both emancipatory and oppressive. The question, going forward, is whether India under Modi can find the change \u2014 the revolution \u2014 it desperately needs, without the upheavals and disruptions that so often follow. Akash Kapur is the author of India Becoming: A Portrait of Life in Modern India.",

STEVE INSKEEP, HOST: It's MORNING EDITION from NPR News. I'm Steve Inskeep. DAVID GREENE, HOST: And I'm David Greene. Tomorrow, Iraq will hold its first national election since U.S. troops withdrew in 2011. The party of the current prime minister, Nouri al-Maliki, appears in the lead. Rights groups say his security forces are abusive - especially toward Sunni Muslims. Maliki is a Shiite and some call him a budding dictator. Others, though, see him as a hero who fought against Saddam Hussein. That's generally the view in Maliki's home town. NPR's Alice Fordham went there. ALICE FORDHAM, BYLINE: In a low farmhouse here by the lush green banks of the river and next to a forest of the family's date palms is where Nouri al Maliki grew up. This is his house, Maliki's house. His nephew, Majid al Maliki, looks just like his uncle, even wearing a suit as he picks his way along the unpaved road. This is Junaja, a tiny village in Iraq's Shiite Muslim heartland. The pale dust here creeps up women's long black robes as they walk. Battered buses overtake donkey carts. The only new thing in town is the mosque. MAJID AL MALIKI: (through translator) The house is open, we can go inside. FORDHAM: OK, great. Majid shows me round his uncle's childhood bedroom - an iron bed, a bookshelf of planks - and gives me a tip. To understand Maliki, look to the faded pictures of his grandfather. He was a leading opponent of British colonial rule. MALIKI: (through translator) He had all those poetry collections. His writings were about the love one feels for the homeland, about nationalism and his desire to reject the occupation and the refusal to succumb to the occupiers. So he was always rebelling for his people and for his homeland. FORDHAM: Relatives were politically-minded Shiite Muslims, living under the oppressive and mostly Sunni Baath Party. Growing up, Maliki read his grandfather's poems, saying the oppressed must leap like lions and work hard for the sake of Islam. (SOUNDBITE OF SCHOOL CHILDREN) FORDHAM: We're invited to see where Nouri al Maliki studied as a little boy. Around the bleached courtyard of the school are the classrooms he used to work in. DHAMER AL KHALJOUDEH: (through translator) Yes, he was serious and virtuous. He had high morals. He used to teach at the village mosque. FORDHAM: That's Dhamer Al Khaljoudeh, the school principal who grew up with Maliki. Maliki got a job as an accountant but he was focused on his work in the outlawed Islamist political movement called the Dawa Party. One day a Baathist policeman came looking for him. KHALJOUDEH: (through translator) He met with some people who told him Maliki isn't there, that he's elsewhere. They told Maliki the security chief was coming for him, and so when he found out they were coming to take him, he fled. FORDHAM: That was 1979, early in the brutal rule of Saddam Hussein. Sixty-seven members of Maliki's family were among the thousands of Shiites eventually killed. He went into exile in Iran and later Syria, sometimes sneaking back to organize resistance fighters. But he couldn't safely return to Iraq until the U.S.-led invasion. Then he put a Dawa office in an old Baath Party building. It was the beginning of the Shiite rise to dominance. ABBAS FADHIL HADI: (through translator) Well, when Mr. Maliki first returned to the area, it's as if he had returned tranquility to our hearts. He did not just avenge my father. He avenged all martyrs. FORDHAM: That's Maliki's young cousin, Abbas Fadhil Hadi. He remembers Maliki led a symbolic funeral for those killed under Saddam, starting in the village and ending in the new Dawa office in nearby Hindiya. I head there to see it.  We're welcomed into the headquarters of the Dawa Party. It's a big white dusty hall with pink flowers on the walls. Alaa al Maliki, a cousin of the prime minister, works at the Dawa Party headquarters, and he was here on that day. ALAA AL MILIKI: (through translator) He raised awareness about Saddam's regime and how it harmed people. And he also talked about all the abuses of the former government. FORDHAM: Maliki became Dawa leader, then prime minister. In other parts of Iraq he's now seen as grudgeful, even a dictator, but in his home town Maliki is an avenger, a symbol of how Iraq's powerless became mighty. Alice Fordham, NPR News.

            "article_content": "One of the founders of Hungary's far-right Jobbik Party has discovered he is Jewish, and that his grandmother is an Auschwitz survivor. Now, he keeps kosher, attends synagogue and visits Israel.  DAVID GREENE, HOST: Now an election story in Europe with a strange twist. As we've been reporting, in European Parliament elections this week, far-right parties did particularly well including Hungary's Jobbik party. They are known for, among other things, being anti-Semitic. It turns out their former second-in-command is Jewish. NPR's Soraya Sarhaddi Nelson reports from Budapest. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVAL RECORDING) CSANAD SZEGEDI: (Speaking foreign language). SORAYA SARHADDI NELSON, BYLINE: Csanad Szegedi was a notorious radical who often railed against Jews, as in this speech four years ago. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVAL RECORDING) SZEGEDI: (Speaking foreign language). NELSON: Like many Hungarian extremists, his radicalism evolved from a staunch hatred of communist. Szegedi helped found the now banned Hungarian Guard, whose members wore uniforms similar to that of a pro-Nazi party that ruled the country in the final months of World War II. Szegedi and other members of the Jobbik party, of which he eventually became vice chairman and represented in the European Parliament, accused Jewish Hungarians of helping Israel try to colonize their country. But these days, the tall Hungarian calls himself Dovid and wears a black skull cap. He regularly attends synagogues, studies Hebrew and the Torah and keeps kosher. Szegedi was on a religious pilgrimage to Israel when I recently interviewed him. SZEGEDI: (Through translator) For 30 years I lived a harmful, aggressive and radical life with extreme views. Now I'm taking the time to reconsider my life and my expectations and where to go next. NELSON: It's a life change that he says came about two years ago with the startling revelation by his maternal grandmother. After some prodding, she told him she is actually Jewish and an Auschwitz survivor. He says he then started on the path to becoming an observant Jew with the help of a Hungarian Rabbi. Back in Budapest, Jobbik spokesmen and Hungarian Parliament member Marton Gyongyosi says their party at first embraced Szegedi's religious conversion. MARTON GYONGYOSI: We said OK. I mean, it's not the origin and the religion that we look at but more what values Mr. Szegedi represents. NELSON: That may have been the party line. But the groups extremist rank and file didn't buy it, says Szabolcs Pogonyi. He's an assistant professor of nationalism studies at Central European University here and describes what he read on extremist websites. SZABOLCS POGONYI: This is what Jews do. They try to infiltrate us. This is again a confirmation that you can't trust Jews. NELSON: Lawmaker Gyongyosi says the Jobbik party ultimately forced Szegedi out when they uncovered a recording in which he tried to bribe an opponent who threatened to reveal his Jewish heritage in 2010. Szegedi denies the claim and says he chose to leave before they could throw him out. He says he decided not to run in Sunday's European Parliament elections because there is no Hungarian political party he can identify with. But Szegedi is having a hard time convincing many Hungarians, especially Jewish ones, that he's abandoned his radical past. They accuse him of being an opportunist who hasn't publicly atoned for fanning anti-Semitic discourse in Hungry. Mircea Cernov says that kind of anti-Semitism is responsible for a monument under construction next to a fountain in downtown Budapest. It portrays Hungary as a victim rather than Germany's accomplice in the Holocaust. Cernov heads the Haver Foundation, which tries to combat prejudice here. MIRCEA CERNOV: I think this Szegedi guy is a clown. Maybe will be better if he would take his grandma and maybe go in schools and having a dialogue with him - with them about his past, about his grandmother. NELSON: Back in Jerusalem, Szegedi says such comments hurt but won't keep him from pursuing his goal of becoming an observant Jew. SZEGEDI: (Speaking foreign language). NELSON: He says while he understands people are angry, they shouldn't judge him until they've walked in his shoes. Soraya Sarhaddi Nelson, NPR News.

But as Europe's far-right parties rise up from the fringes, Svoboda is now the odd man out: anti-Putin and pro-EU.  DAVID GREENE, HOST: Europe's far-right parties did well, really well in last week's elections to the European Parliament. But their embrace of Russia and its annexation of Crimea is not exactly what the far-right counterparts in Ukraine were expecting. NPR's Peter Kenyon reports on a rare right-wing party that favors EU integration and joining NATO. PETER KENYON, BYLINE: The Svoboda, or the freedom party, is the most prominent nationalist party in Ukraine. Although it didn't fare well in Sunday's presidential election. With just over 1 percent of the vote, analysts note that Svoboda got fewer than half the votes won by the Jewish candidate in what Russia seasons anti-Semitic country. Svoboda is, however, part of the government coalition that's been in power since former Pres. Victor Yanukovych fled to Russia. Russian media routinely accused Svoboda along with more extreme parties such as right sector of plotting to bring fascist and Neo-Nazi values to Russia's border. But these days Svoboda is an anomaly among the European far-right. Erica Rocha, deputy leader of Svoboda watched in disbelief as his far right counterpart best to defend Vladimir Putin's move to swallow up the Crimea Penisula. UNIDENTIFIED MAN: (Through translator)  At the moment, we do not consider European far-right partners to be a partners. During our revolution dignity,  we cut our ties with European nationalist because of their support of Putin's illegal annexation. KENYON: Europe's far-right seems thrilled by Russia's brute force approach to confronting the growth of the European Union. Marine Le Pen of France's National Front and Nigel Farage of Brittan's U.K. Independence Party are among Vladimir Putin's admirers. Ukrainian political scientist Andreas Umland notes the irony of Moscow railing  against what it calls Neo-Nazis and fascists in Ukraine while accepted praise from Neo-Nazi groups elsewhere in Europe. Umland says Svoboda seems it seems to be evolving to something closer to a traditional conservative party. ANDREAS UMLAND: Although it is nationalistic it has now adopted rather unusual positions for right radical party concerning new integration and NATO integration that is now turning into a slight scandal for Svoboda because it used to have relations to parties that are now supporting Putin and his becoming an embarrassment. KENYON: Svoboda's Syrotiuk says his party does indeed support integration and even becoming a part of NATO mainly because they see no other way to defend the country against Russiam aggression. He says it's been a painful lesson to learn that he's talking nationalism with other European far-right politicians There're not talking about the same thing. YURIY SYROTIUK: (Through translator) But now we realize that what we call nationalism here is patriotism in Europe. And what Europeans call nationalism we consider Chauvinism. It's a different political lexicon. KENYON: Syrotiuk says it's not forging new links mainly with center-right European parties. Analysts warn, however, that despite it's pro EU and NATO view it should not be mistaken for mainstream right-of-center group. Analysts say in the current tense climate a bigger potential danger for Ukraine might be fresh support for truly extreme parties like right-center based on the uncompromising anti-Russian stance. UMLAND: The right sector especially if the confrontation of Russia continues may get an image of the sort of most devoted patriots, not because people will become more xenophobic or homophobic but rather because the both see these radically patriotic parties as sort of adequate to the current charges of Ukraine. KENYON: But for the moment, both Svoboda and right-sector enjoy marginal support in Ukraine despite the relentless efforts of some Russian media to build them up. Peter Kenyon NPR News, Kiev.

As it became increasingly clear in recent months that he was likely to become India's next leader, the U.S. and European countries began reaching out to him.\n                \n                    \n                    Sam Panthaky /AFP/Getty Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption Narendra Modi, shown here at an April 5 campaign rally, was ostracized by the United States for more than a decade. As it became increasingly clear in recent months that he was likely to become India's next leader, the U.S. and European countries began reaching out to him. Until a few months ago, the U.S. government was effectively boycotting Narendra Modi, the man who is virtually certain to be India's next prime minister following the landslide victory by his party in the country's parliamentary elections. So will the U.S. now warm to Modi as the elected leader of the world's largest democracy? Before answering that, let's look at why Washington refused to deal with him. The Americans, along with other Western governments, turned their back on Modi after widespread rioting in 2002 in Gujarat state, where he had become chief minister a year earlier. The trouble began when some 60 Hindu pilgrims were killed in a train fire blamed on Muslims. Hindus then went on a rampage, killing more than 1,000 people in revenge, mostly Muslims. Critics accused Modi, a Hindu nationalist, of not doing enough to stop the carnage, if not worse. Politicians close to him were convicted of involvement, including one of his Cabinet ministers who was sentenced to 28 years in prison. Modi has always denied any wrongdoing, and subsequent investigations did not implicate him. However, human rights groups criticized those inquiries and Western governments kept their distance. During President George W. Bush's administration, the U.S. went so far as to deny Modi a visa in 2005 on the grounds of \"severe violations of religious freedom.\" Modi did address the riots in a blog post last December. \"I was shaken to the core,\" he wrote. He did not offer an apology, which many victims and their relatives had sought. But as it became increasingly likely that Modi's Bharatiya Janata Party would win the election, Western countries reversed course and began reaching out. The U.S. ambassador to India, Nancy Powell, traveled to Gujarat's capital, Gandhinagar, and held talks with Modi at his residence in February, which effectively ended the boycott. European countries also re-established contact. And with the election victory, any doubts about Modi's political standing in Washington quickly evaporated. Just hours after the results were announced, President Obama called Modi, congratulating him and inviting him to Washington. Foreign affairs commentator Fareed Zakaria called the U.S. ostracism of Modi \"selective, arbitrary and excessive.\" In addition, Zakaria said the two countries needed a closer partnership, particularly at a time when Obama is calling for the U.S. to pivot to Asia. Zakaria wrote: \"If the United States and India, the world's oldest and largest democracies, could create a genuine partnership, it would be good for Asian stability, for global prosperity, and, most especially, for the cause of democracy and human rights around the world.\" To cite just a few key issues, the U.S. and India are both concerned about the instability in Afghanistan and Pakistan and are also keeping close watch on China's growing clout in Asia. While Modi, 63, was unwelcome in the West until recently, he has been a regular visitor to China. His pro-business agenda has included encouraging Chinese investment in Gujarat, a western coastal state that also borders Pakistan. His election campaign stressed the economic development in the state, which has seen unprecedented growth since he took over in 2001. However, critics say that powerful businessmen have been the big winners and that many of the poor have seen few benefits. Modi, the son of a train station tea vendor, will have a strong mandate after such an overwhelming electoral win. It appeared his BJP would have an outright majority in Parliament and would not be required to find coalition partners. This would mark the first time in three decades that one Indian party has so dominated an election. Modi should also push for a larger Indian role in regional affairs, according to Zakaria. \"New Delhi's ruling elites remain ambivalent about the kind of foreign policy they should conduct, trapped between their old, Third World, anti-colonial impulses and the obvious requirements of a new Asia in which China is emerging as the dominant power,\" he wrote. \"The result is that India has shied away from the kind of robust relationship with the United States that would help it economically, militarily and politically.\" Greg Myre is the international editor at NPR.org.

            "article_content": "NATO is scaling back cooperation with Russia to punish it for its annexation of Ukraine's Crimean peninsula. While the rhetoric is tough, Secretary Kerry is keeping the door open for negotiations.  DAVID GREENE, HOST: Ever since Russia annexed Crimea, NATO has been watching and waiting for Russia's next moves. This morning, NATO's military commander, U.S. Air Force General Philip Breedlove, said Russia has the forces it needs along Ukraine's border to carryout a full scale invasion of the eastern part of that country within a matter of days. Hoping to exert some pressure, NATO announced its suspending what it calls practical civilian and military cooperation with Russia. Russia's government for its part said neither side will gain from what it called a return to Cold War rhetoric. But these tensions are familiar in some ways. As NPR's Michele Kelemen reports, Secretary of State John Kerry has been keeping the line open to his Russian counterpart. MICHELE KELEMEN, BYLINE: When Secretary Kerry turned his plane around last weekend to go to Paris to meet Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov, a former ambassador to Moscow, Michael McFaul, reminded his Facebook followers of another moment of high drama between the White House and the Kremlin. It was the Berlin crisis in 1961. And then-President John F. Kennedy had this to say about diplomacy with the Soviets. PRESIDENT JOHN F. KENNEDY: We cannot negotiate with those who say what's mine is mine and what's yours is negotiable. KELEMEN: That is a strong diplomatic principle, says Stephen Sestanovich of the Council on Foreign Relations. But he adds Kennedy didn't actually stick to it. STEPHEN SESTANOVICH: His approach to Berlin was to threaten military calamity if the Russians did anything. And then try to find every way of negotiating a new deal for the status of West Berlin. KELEMEN: Sestanovich says Kennedy's military threats turned about to be sufficiently credible so the Soviets were impressed and restrained. The same can't be said of today's crisis over Ukraine. Russia looks to be on a roll after annexing Crimea and massing troops on the border. So there are risks, he says, to talking to Russia now about the things Moscow is seeking in Ukraine; more autonomy and more protection for Russian speakers. SESTANOVICH: To offer them a peaceful way to dismantle Ukraine is really to give them a kind of geopolitical jackpot that they never dreamed of. Putin's policy in Ukraine is, except for Crimea, a failure. He's united the country against him where he thought he might be able to dominate it. KELEMEN: Secretary Kerry insists he's not making decisions for Ukrainians but consulting the new authorities in Kiev and keeping them up to date on his diplomacy. President Bush's National Security Advisor Stephen Hadley says he hopes that these talks and phones calls are leading up to broader negotiations about relations between the two former Soviet states. STEPHEN HADLEY: That should be a conversation that the United States should be facilitating between Ukrainians and Russians. It should not be a closed-door conversation between the American secretary of state and the Russian foreign minister, where the two of them decide the future of Ukraine. KELEMEN: One longtime Ukraine watcher, Adrian Karatnycky of the Atlantic Council, doesn't sound quite as alarmed about the closed-door meetings, though. ADRIAN KARATNYCKY: I do think it's appropriate because I do think it's something that was initiated from the Russian side. And I think it's a sign that the Russians are looking for a way to step back from the precipice. KELEMEN: Ukraine needs to reform its highly centralized state anyway, he says. It needs local governments, local police and some flexibility on language laws. KARATNYCKY: So I think there are ways of giving Putin the appearance of extracting some concessions without sacrificing anything in the nature of good policy. KELEMEN: None of that will solve the issue of Crimea, Karatnycky says, but it could ease tensions along the border as Ukraine heads into elections. Michele Kelemen, NPR News, Washington.

            "article_content": "With deportations at a record high under the Obama administration, and with immigration reform stalled in Congress, Dreamer protest groups are trying to keep the issue alive with actions of their own.  AUDIE CORNISH, HOST: From NPR News, this is ALL THINGS CONSIDERED. I'm Audie Cornish. ROBERT SIEGEL, HOST: And I'm Robert Siegel. The number of undocumented immigrants deported under the Obama administration is expected to hit two million this month. That is more than under any previous president. The leader of the nation's largest Latino advocacy group now calls President Obama the deporter-in-chief, and the president has set up a task force to evaluate the approach to deportation. But it is clear that an overhaul of the country's immigration policy is stalled in Washington, and advocates are trying to keep the issue alive on their own. NPR's Kelly McEvers reports from the U.S.-Mexico border. UNIDENTIFIED MAN: We don't need everybody to hold posters. We're going to need some clapping. We need some singing. Everybody needs to be on this. KELLY MCEVERS, BYLINE: It's a hot morning in the parking lot at the IHOP in this desolate stretch of desert south of San Diego. About a hundred protesters form a circle and practice their songs. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) MCEVERS: The plan is to walk down this road, past the 7-Eleven and the taco joints and up to the gates and checkpoints that form the Otay-Mesa border crossing. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) MCEVERS: There they'll watch as 35 people who left the U.S. for Mexico - either because they were deported or because they were afraid of being deported - try to cross back into the U.S.. The event was organized by the National Immigrant Youth Alliance, a sometimes controversial group of mostly undocumented students that stages protests around the country. The latest image the group wants to portray is families, families who've lived in the U.S. but were split up by deportations, says Enrique Morones, founder of a group called Border Angels. ENRIQUE MORONES: The majority of the country without a doubt has no idea that this is going on. They don't know that families are being separated right now. MCEVERS: The tactic at this protest of trying to cross people back into the U.S. started with the Dream 9 protest last summer in Arizona. Maria Peniche was one of them. In 2012, her parents' employers said they would start checking papers. So the family left the U.S. and went back to Mexico City on their own. There, Maria Peniche says a relative tried to sexually assault her. MARIA PENICHE: And I told everyone what he was trying to do. And he didn't like that. So after a week of the incident, I started being followed in and out of my home by strange men and by police, Mexican police officers. MCEVERS: So Peniche joined up with other activists who were already in Mexico or who came back to Mexico. The so-called Dream 9 showed up at a border crossing and claimed asylum. They've all been released into the U.S., where they await final hearings. The next action was 30 more people trying to cross last fall - same strategy, same result. Maria Peniche's brother came with that group. Her parents are in this latest group trying to cross back into the U.S. She says they were afraid to stay in Mexico. PENICHE: It's scary not knowing if, just because your mom didn't answer your last message on Facebook last night, it was because they came in and raided their home. So now, I'd rather have them safe in a detention center instead of worrying about them every single day. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) MCEVERS: After the speeches, the protesters march up to a bridge overlooking the border crossing, where uniformed customs officers stop and search every car and pedestrian coming through the checkpoint. (SOUNDBITE OF CHEERING) MCEVERS: They celebrate when they see Maria Peniche's parents and the others walk up to customs agents, get handcuffed and head into a temporary holding area. The protesters' tactic is for some of these 35 people to ask for asylum, and for others to apply for something called humanitarian parole which could let them rejoin their families in the U.S. (SOUNDBITE OF PROTEST) MCEVERS: The protesters say that with the immigration reform bill that passed the Senate last summer, now stalled in Washington, immigration reform starts here. They say they're bringing people back into the U.S. on their own. In the days that follow, they'll try to cross dozens more. It's a tactic that has some in the movement worried. First, because it's hard to be granted asylum in the U.S. And second, they say because putting people in sticky legal situations could be considered unethical. David Leopold is a prominent immigration lawyer. He says what protesters should do is focus on Republicans who won't bring the Senate's immigration bill to the House floor. DAVID LEOPOLD: Immigration reform would be the law of the land if it weren't for three people. MCEVERS: House speaker John Boehner, he says, and the other two Republican House leaders. LEOPOLD: So the focus at the moment is to get the House of Representatives to do something and stop delaying. MCEVERS: As midterm elections approach, Leopold says that means protesters should hit their representatives where it hurts. LEOPOLD: Whether it's a sit-in in John Boehner's office or why not target districts where there's some vulnerability, and try to get some people in there who are going to vote in favor of immigration reform. To me, that is the harder work. That is the grassroots work. MCEVERS: The protesters do admit that even if they get a few hundred people back into the U.S., it's no match for the two million who have been deported. As for those 35 people, including Maria Peniche's parents who tried to cross last week, four children were allowed into the U.S., one adult was deported back to Mexico and the rest of the adults are awaiting hearings in temporary detention at the border.

Franklin/AP\n                    \n                \nhide caption Demonstrators protest the Obama administration's deportation policies in Phoenix last year. Five months before his 2012 re-election, President Obama announced that his administration would stop deportations of more than a half-million young adults, often referred to as \"Dreamers,\" brought illegally to the U.S. as children. Latinos subsequently turned out to vote in record numbers that fall. More than 70 percent marked their ballots for Obama \u2014 helping him win the popular vote and triumph in key battleground states. But with growing anger among Latinos over the continued aggressive pace of adult deportations, and with Democrats facing an unforgiving midterm election season, Obama said Thursday he would review the administration's immigration enforcement policies. The pivot came amid pressure to slow deportations \u2014 or even halt them for some new groups. \"In my humble opinion, there is nothing to stop the president of the United States from saying the moms and dads of the Dreamers should be able to apply for the same kind of discretion as their children,\" said Rep. Luis Gutierrez, D-Ill. He was among Hispanic congressional leaders who met Thursday with Obama to discuss immigration and the increasingly contentious deportation issue. Before the meeting, \"the president said there was nothing he could do about\" the deportations, Gutierrez said in an interview Friday with NPR. (There have been more than 2 million during Obama's administration.) \"Yesterday, he said, 'We're looking at options,' \" Gutierrez said. \"I think that's a step in the right direction.\" Though the White House has indicated it is unlikely to expand the Dreamers' deportation moratorium, the topic is expected to be part of conversations that Hispanic leaders will be having with administration officials in coming weeks. Other options also being discussed include suspending deportation of parents and spouses of U.S. citizens, of immediate family of military service members, and of people with temporary immigration status who could be allowed to apply for permanent status. Gutierrez and fellow members of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus dropped plans to introduce a resolution to urge the president to slow deportations in the interest of keeping families together. \"It seems better to speak with someone than pass a resolution,\" Gutierrez said. Obama's post-meeting pledge to see how his administration \"can conduct enforcement more humanely within the confines of the law\" prompted a warning from Republicans that unilateral executive action could jeopardize the prospects of comprehensive immigration overhaul legislation. A comprehensive bill passed by the Senate last June has languished in the GOP-controlled House. On Thursday, House Republicans passed a bill that would allow Congress to sue the president for failing to enforce immigration laws by offering temporary legal status to Dreamers. A 2011 memo on deportation by the Congressional Hispanic Caucus for Obama provides insight into what Latino activists are pushing for from the president and the Department of Homeland Security, which enforces immigration law. That memo, which outlined the Dreamers action taken by the president a year later, also describes what it characterizes as legal ways that deportations that separate families can be mitigated in the absence of a comprehensive national immigration policy. The memo, provided by Gutierrez's office, proposes deferred deportation actions for otherwise law-abiding parents of DREAM-eligible individuals, and for the parents of children born in the U.S., but who have overstayed their visas. Young people eligible as Dreamers (named after failed DREAM Act legislation) are immune from deportation if they were brought to the U.S. before age 16, have lived in the country for five consecutive years, graduated from high school or served in the military, and have no convictions for felonies, or for significant or multiple misdemeanors. When Congress returns from its spring break at the end of the month, Hispanic congressional leaders will meet with Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson. Until then, says Gutierrez, Latino activists will keep up pressure on the president, and on House Republicans. \"There is no confusion in the immigrant community about which party is blocking immigration reform,\" he said, noting that 2000 Latino citizens turn 18 every day \u2014 a \"demographic tsunami\" that he says Republicans know is coming and can't ignore. And about anger toward Obama, whom some Latino activists have dubbed \"Deporter in Chief,\" he said this: \"He's our friend. He's our ally. This is not easy. I have nothing but respect, admiration and love for Barack Obama.\" But, he adds: \"Our first allegiance is to the immigrant community, and second to our party.\" Just how far the president will go to placate that community during a midterm election year that has his party on the run remains to be seen.",

Even before the details of the president's executive action on immigration came down, William Gheen was hitting the phones, organizing demonstrations outside the Las Vegas high school Obama visited Friday. \"I don't know what's going to be effective, I don't think anybody ever expected that the president of the United States would side with an illegal immigrant invasion over American citizens' interest, but that's what's happened here,\" Gheen says. Gheen is president of one of the country's largest anti-illegal immigration PACs, Americans for Legal Immigration. Activists like him are angry about the president's unilateral action to extend deportation relief to parents of U.S. citizens or lawful permanent residents and thousands more young people. But make no mistake, their opposition is about a lot more than just procedure. Starting early Friday morning, protesters began gathering outside Del Sol High School, where Obama spoke, standing along a sundrenched sidewalk and waving signs that read \"Amnesty Hell No\" and \"Impeach Obama.\" \"The American people spoke loud and clear at the last election,\" says Patrice Lynes, who drove there from Riverside, Calif. \"They wanted no amnesty, and they overwhelmingly elected Republicans.\" Lynes was also in Murrieta, Calif., this past summer when buses carrying unaccompanied minors were turned away from a Border Patrol processing center. She supports the House Republicans who blocked a bipartisan immigration bill that passed the U.S. Senate in 2013. Frustrated Farmers Illegal immigration long has been a lightning rod issue in the Southwest. But it's one that also tends to cut right across traditional party lines. Conservative-leaning farm groups are also among those disappointed by the president's action, but for far different reasons. \"That does not get us any closer to resolving a very difficult national problem,\" says Tom Nassif, CEO of Western Growers. Farmers did not get any special attention in the president's plan. They long have lobbied Congress for a guest worker program that would provide deportation relief to immigrants willing to work on farms for at least five years. The industry says it's facing a long-term labor crisis, especially in California and Arizona. The workforce is getting older, and tighter border security lately is deterring more migrant workers from coming north. \"We all agree, I think, that the best solution is for the U.S. Congress to reassert its constitutional authority and pass immigration bills that both parties can vote for and can become law,\" Nassif says. Nassif doesn't think the president's unilateral action necessarily will change the dynamics in Congress, though. He's optimistic that an overhaul bill still will gain traction come January. To DREAMers, A Plan Too Narrow But it's safe to say that optimism isn't as pervasive in cities like Los Angeles. In the immigrant-heavy neighborhoods around the markets and pop-up shops of Alvarado Street, life probably will go on unchanged for thousands of people living here without papers. Angel Fernandez, left, and Jose Patino interrupt U.S. President Barack Obama's speech on U.S. immigration policy Friday at Del Sol High School on in Las Vegas.

The two, who were brought to the United States as children and are protected from deportation by the president's policies, were upset that their parents still could be forced to leave. Justino Mora, a political science student at UCLA, is pleased the president acted, but he says the plan isn't expansive enough. \"It's going to keep out a lot of people who could contribute so much to our country,\" he says. Mora's mixed feelings stem from the fact that he got deportation relief the last time the president issued an executive action on immigration, in 2012, and was hoping his mother might be eligible this year. She brought him to the U.S. from Mexico when he was 11, he says, fleeing extreme poverty and domestic violence. Because Mora is not a citizen, though, his mother won't be eligible for relief under the president's plan. \"Which is, you know, something that is frustrating,\" he says, \"knowing that she was basically the person that saved my life, saved my siblings' life, and has sacrificed so much to give us a better opportunity.\" But Mora says the president's decision to act alone does send a clear message to Congress. The big question now is what lawmakers' next move will be.",

            "article_content": "The Obama administration's request for more funds on immigration could get a congressional vote soon. Meanwhile, the crisis at the border is complicating Obama's plan to take unilateral action to ease deportations. The politics of immigration are shifting quickly.  ROBERT SIEGEL, HOST: On the topic of immigration, especially child migrants, Congress could vote as early as next week on the Obama administration's request for more funds and flexibility. Meanwhile, the crisis at the border is affecting the larger debate about immigration reform. And it's complicating President Obama's plans to take unilateral action to ease deportations of immigrants who've been here illegally for years. NPR's national political correspondent Mara Liasson reports. MARA LIASSON, BYLINE: Immigration politics are volatile and complex, but until the flood of children on the border, immigration reform looked like a long-term winner for Democrats and a long-term loser for Republicans. But recent polls show that like any other chaotic situation from the Middle East to the VA, this one has taken a toll on Mr. Obama. A new Pew poll shows that only 28 percent approve of the way he's handling the border situation. That's why, says immigration reform advocate, Simon Rosenberg, the president needs to get the border under control fast. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) SIMON ROSENBERG: How this crisis gets resolved will dictate the next chapter in this ongoing debate. I think it's jumbled everything, and a lot will depend on whether or not the president looks like he's done a good job. And if he's handled this well, he's going to have a lot more political space with the public. LIASSON: The White House is operating on two tracks. It's trying to resolve the immediate border crisis - in some cases that means accelerating deportations. Meanwhile, it's planning to move on the broader immigration problem. The administration is considering the legal and political ramifications of having the president take unilateral action to ease deportations for a whole other group of illegal immigrants - people who've been in this country for years. Some Democrats have wondered whether the president could hurt his party if he uses his executive authority to offer wider deportation relief this fall before the midterm elections. But White House officials say there's no reason to delay. They point to polls that show public support is as strong as ever for providing a path to legal status for workers currently in the U.S. illegally. The White House plan remains as the president outlined it in a Rose Garden speech last month. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) PRESIDENT BARACK OBAMA: If Congress will not do their job, at least we can do ours. LIASSON: With immigration reform blocked in the Republican House, Mr. Obama promised to act on his own, just as soon as his Attorney General and Homeland Security Secretary finish their review. OBAMA: I expect the recommendations before the end of summer, and I intend to adopt those regulations without further delay. LIASSON: There is a wide range of unilateral actions the president could take to build upon the action he took in 2012, when he used his executive authority to protect the dreamers - young people in college or the military who were brought here illegally as children. Beyond the dreamers, Mr. Obama could decide to provide temporary relief from deportation for the parents of dreamers, or people who work in certain industries or meet other criteria. What would be the reaction to such a move? It's hard to game out. There's no polling on how people would feel if the president unilaterally created a temporary worker program all by himself without congressional approval. There could be a huge backlash. Daniel Garza, a conservative proponent of immigration reform, says the dreamers are a special case. Garza says most Americans will not feel the same way about other groups of illegal immigrants. DANIEL GARZA: There's a lesser sympathy for the adults who have violated immigration law than there is for the children. I think people understand that children are brought here on their own. And I'm someone who is for immigration reform. LIASSON: But Frank Sharry, an immigration reform advocate on the left, has a different analysis of what would happen if the president moved on his own to give large numbers of illegal immigrants relief. FRANK SHARRY: I think that the combination of the thrills and reaction among Latinos and Progressives and Democrats will be equaled by the howls from the Republicans. And I think quite frankly, it will permanently cement the reputation of the Democrats as for immigrants and for the changing American electorate and Republicans as against it. LIASSON: Sharry thinks if the president does move to expand deportation relief, he would force Republicans to say whether those immigrants should go back into the shadows or be deported right away. And he would unavoidably intensify the current debate about executive overreach. SHARRY: It would be a bold move. It would create a huge reaction from the Republicans. It would protect millions of people and lead to a better quality of life. And the question is - is he brave enough to do it and what would be the political fallout? LIASSON: Brave enough or foolish depending on your point of view. Widespread deportation relief is the kind of presidential action that could have long-lasting effects on the president's party and his legacy. But in the midst of the current crisis on the border, it's hard to determine if those effects would be positive or negative. Mara Liasson, NPR News, Washington. Copyright \u00a9 2014 NPR.

            "article_content": "First lady Michelle Obama and invited guests in her box applaud during President Obama's State of the Union address in Washington, Jan. 25, 2011.\n                \n                    \n                    Charles Dharapak/AP\n                    \n                \nhide caption First lady Michelle Obama and invited guests in her box applaud during President Obama's State of the Union address in Washington, Jan. 25, 2011. Just like the issues and themes that color the annual State of the Union speech, the list of White House invitees is intended to send a message about what an administration cares about and prioritizes. The State of the Union guests, after all, are announced beforehand with biographies attached. And the typically staggered announcement of names allows the media to chew them over for several news cycles. To date, the Obama administration has selected a potpourri of exceptional students, inspiring members of the military, everyday heroes, and regular folks who exemplify the merit of programs favored by the president. This year is no exception. The White House Monday released the names and bios of six of the two dozen or so guests expected to join first lady Michelle Obama Tuesday evening to watch her husband deliver his fifth State of the Union address before a joint session of Congress. More names are expected to come. The guests, so far, are: The limited list is a nod to Obama's efforts on behalf of gay Americans and the focus that he's given in every State of the Union to science and technology education, teachers, and public servants. As in past years, with the inclusion of Bauman and Arredondo, the invitations recognize those involved in a significant news event. The guest lists of Obama's previous State of the Union addresses \u2014 from his first in 2009, coming off his first election (though technically not a State of the Union), to his most recent in 2013, just after his re-election \u2014 provide time capsules of sorts. They are public snapshots of the president's mood, his political and legislative aims, and recent news, both tragic and inspiring. 2009 Fresh off his historic election as the nation's first African-American president, Obama invited Lilly Ledbetter, the plaintiff in an employment discrimination case whose name is attached to the first piece of legislation signed by the new president. The Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Restoration Act expanded the time frame in which wage discrimination complaints can be filed. His other guests offered a glimpse of the president's outreach to his new city as well as other issues of prominence \u2014 students from D.C. schools; the first lady's attention to military families, service members, and a nod to green energy (a solar company founder). One unfortunate development since that first State of the Union: One of the \"hero\" guests, Philadelphia police officer Richard DeCoatsworth, shot in the face in the line of duty, went from a seat next to Michelle Obama to being arrested last year on charges he drugged and raped two women at gunpoint. 2010 The Obamas' 2010 guest list steered clear of high-profile names. Those picked were intended to show the benefits of the Recovery Act (a Phoenix business that makes electric vehicle battery charging infrastructure was one), as well as a \"green economy\" activist from Kansas City. The White House showed early support for gay couples, hosting an Indianapolis business owner planning with his partner to adopt, and with another guest highlighted one of the president's modest legislative successes \u2014 legislation banning credit card companies from unfairly raising interest rates on existing businesses. 2011 Just weeks before the State of the Union, Arizona Rep. Gabrielle Giffords was critically injured when she was shot by an assailant at a campaign event near Tucson; six others were killed and 13 were injured. It was an emotional night on Capitol Hill; among the Obamas' guests were Giffords' husband, astronaut Mark Kelly; the battlefield-trained former military doctor who oversaw Giffords' treatment; and the parents of Christina-Taylor Green, a 9-year-old killed in the attack. Other guests included business people whose companies benefited from Recovery Act loans; the founder of a drilling company business whose product helped save 37 miners trapped in Chile; and regular citizens who had benefited from provisions in the Affordable Health Care Act that prevented denial of coverage for pre-existing conditions. 2012 The \"celebrity\" guest two years ago was Warren Buffett's secretary, Debbie Bosanek, made famous by her billionaire boss, who said he paid a lower tax rate (17.4 percent) than his longtime employee (35.8 percent). Her presence underscored the heated debate over whether wealthier Americans should pay higher rates than middle-income earners, a proposal Obama had referred to as the \"Buffett rule.\" Also joining Michelle Obama were San Antonio Mayor Julian Castro, a rising Hispanic star; home refinance beneficiaries; more solar and high-tech business people; as well as a cancer survivor who would have lost insurance coverage without Affordable Care Act provisions rolled out early. 2013 Weeks after a rampaging gunman killed 20 children and six educators at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Conn., Kaitlin Roig, a teacher at the school, was a guest of the first lady. Roid helped save 15 of her first-grade students by hiding them in a bathroom. While honoring the families and staff of Sandy Hook, the White House also hosted the parents of a Chicago girl murdered a month after performing with her school in Obama's inaugural events; the police officer first on the scene at the deadly Sikh temple shooting in Oak Creed, Wis.; Apple's CEO; a nurse who worked to save at-risk infants during Hurricane Sandy; a Hispanic \"DREAMer\" (a young person brought to the U.S. as a child by parents who came here illegally, but who is seeking an education and path to citizenship); and 102-year-old \"Granny,\" who waited in a long voter line to cast her ballot for Obama, were also guests. This year's guest list is expected to reflect much of the same Obama tradition of reflecting the news of the times \u2014 hopeful and tragic \u2014 as well as the themes of the president's own agenda, big and small, going into his sixth year in the Oval Office.",

            "article_content": "Eric Cantor became the first house majority leader ever to lose a primary, losing the GOP nomination to Tea Party challenger David Brat in the Republican primary.  MELISSA BLOCK, HOST: A huge political shock for the Republican party - the House majority leader, Eric Cantor, is on his way out. Cantor suffered a major upset in today's primary election in Virginia. He lost to an underdog backed by the Tea Party, and it wasn't even close. For more, we're joined by NPR's Tamara Keith. And, Tamara, let's put this in context. This is being described in historic terms - one of the most shocking upsets in congressional history. And it seems that nobody saw this coming. TAMARA KEITH, BYLINE: Exactly. I mean, unprecedented is not exactly the right word. There have been other big defeats, but you have to go way back to find them. Here you have the second-in-charge of the House Republicans, second-highest ranking political figure, knocked out in a primary no less and coming after two previous races where there were no real signs of any trouble. He wasn't even challenged in 2010. In 2012, he won 79 percent in his primary. But David Brat came out of sort of nowhere, was a Tea Party favorite candidate and blew Eric Cantor away. BLOCK: And we should mention that Eric Cantor was considered to be a likely successor to the speaker of the house, John Boehner. Interesting, Tam, that even David Brat's main strategist told Politico he was stunned. I think we all are waiting to wake up to see if this really happened, he said. KEITH: Yeah, well, and Eric Cantor, in addition to being often talked about as a speaker-in-waiting, is also just a prolific fundraiser. He outraised David Brat significantly. Cantor had $5 million that he raised. David Brat raised $200,000. Cantor came out early and ran ads against Brat, which to some was seen as a sign of weakness. And what Brat had on his side was that he was seen as the outsider that - sort of the Tea Party candidate. He also became the favorite candidate of many in conservative media, which certainly helped him. And Eric Cantor had this problem of, he is in the leadership. He is sort of, in many ways, easily painted as the Republican establishment. Though, at times, he's worked well with the Tea Party and seen as a sympathetic figure - even got some votes last year when they were trying to oust - when some Tea Party folks were trying to oust John Boehner as speaker. Eric Cantor actually got some votes in that effort. But he was easily painted as an establishment figure, and at times, has been seen as sort of an opportunist who hung with the Tea Party guys because they were the cool kids and at other times has been more moderate. BLOCK: Eric Cantor, I think, did cast votes to raise the debt ceiling to end the government shutdown. Did those back backfire among the conservative base back home? KEITH: Well, here's the thing. When you're in the leadership, you actually do have to take those tough votes. You have to do the things that make the deals happen. And behind the scenes, you're twisting arms and trying to convince other people to take those votes. But certainly, those types of votes - also at least some willingness to talk about immigration reform or to talk about a DREAM Act of some kind - those things were absolutely held against him in this race. BLOCK: Briefly, Tamara, should we assume now that the Tea Party has not been written off in terms of its electoral power? KEITH: That is - I think that the obituaries may have been written a little bit too soon. Certainly, Eric Cantor is now the biggest scalp that they've gotten in these primaries. And Democrats are sort of gleefully looking at this and saying, look at this race. This is an example of just how extreme the Republican Party is. BLOCK: OK, Tamara, thanks so much. That's NPR's Tamara Keith reporting on today's major political upset - again, the news that House Majority Leader Eric Cantor has lost to his primary election opponent, David Brat, backed by the Tea Party.

            "article_content": "Even as President Obama and GOP leaders meet in search of common ground, the immigration issue threatens to divide them.  MELISSA BLOCK, HOST: Congressional leaders spent a little more than two hours at the White House this afternoon for lunch and a chat with the president. This was the first face-to-face meeting since the midterm elections. Tuesday's results were tough on the president's party as Republicans took control of the Senate and solidified their majority in the House. As NPR's Tamara Keith reports from the White House, an early test of this divided government is likely to be immigration. TAMARA KEITH, BYLINE: President Obama and congressional leaders gathered around a big wooden table in the old family dining room. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) PRESIDENT BARACK OBAMA: Well, I want to thank the leadership of both the House and the Senate for being here for this lunch postelection. KEITH: Reporters were quickly ushered out. And around the time the salad and sea bass were served, protesters calling for Obama to act on immigration had begun marching outside the White House. (SOUNDBITE OF PROTESTS) UNIDENTIFIED PROTESTERS: (Chanting) Hey, Obama, do not deport my mama. Hey... KEITH: They carried signs and a giant American flag with chants alternating between English and Spanish. (SOUNDBITE OF PROTESTS) PROTESTERS: (Chanting) No more deportations. No more deportations. KEITH: Their message? - President Obama needs to follow through on his promise to take unilateral action on immigration before the end of the year. Gustavo Torres is the head of Casa de Virginia and Maryland, which organized today's protest. GUSTAVO TORRES: To make sure that the president listens to us because this is the moment that he has. He has a historical opportunity. KEITH: The president was supposed to act by the end of this summer, but he postponed it. Now he says he'll do it by the end of the year. It is widely thought he'll give legal status and work permits to several million people. Much like the administration did in 2011 with young people known as DREAMers. Torres says he wants the president to make his action as broad as possible to help people now living in fear of deportation. TORRES: They don't have criminal records. They are people who want to be Americans and they need a chance to be able to. KEITH: At the same time Obama is getting pressure from immigration activists, he's getting squeezed on the other side by congressional Republicans who say executive action now would destroy any chance of bipartisan cooperation. Even in the bland language of statements released after the lunch, it was clear the president and House Speaker John Boehner exchanged strong words. Boehner's staff said he warned the president against, quote, \"executive amnesty.\" This echoes what Boehner told reporters yesterday. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) REPRESENTATIVE JOHN BOEHNER: That's why I made it clear - the president, if he continues to go down this path of taking action on his own, he's inviting big trouble. KEITH: Over the course of the past year, President Obama has had a number of conversations with House Speaker John Boehner on the possibility of the House taking up immigration legislation. The Senate passed up a bipartisan, comprehensive immigration reform bill more than a year ago, and the president wanted Boehner to take it up. The conversations between the men were mostly initiated by the president, according to one House aide, who described them as gut checks rather than negotiations. White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) JOSH EARNEST: But those conversations didn't lead to anything in the House, at least with House Republicans. KEITH: And as a result, Earnest is making the case that the president feels he has no other option than to go it alone. Tamara Keith, NPR News, the White House. Copyright \u00a9 2014 NPR.

            "article_content": "President Obama is expected to unveil his long-awaited and controversial executive action on immigration in a prime-time speech on Thursday night. Millions of people could be affected.  ROBERT SIEGEL, HOST: Pres. Obama delivers a primetime address tonight from the White House. He\u2019ll lay out the unilateral actions that he\u2019s taking to make temporary changes in the nation\u2019s immigration system. NPR\u2019s Mara Liasson is at the White House today. And, Mara, what do you know about what the president will unveil tonight? MARA LIASSON, BYLINE: The president is going to announce a series of steps that will allow as many as 5 million people to stay in the country and possibly get temporary work authorization through expanding the definition of the DREAMers \u2013 kids brought here illegally as children by their parents. Currently, you\u2019re eligible if you entered before June 2007 and were born after 1981. Now there will be no age limit, but you have to have entered by January 2010, and you have to have been brought here when you were 16 or under. He\u2019ll also offered deportation relief to parents of U.S. citizens and legal permanent residence, beefed-up border security, and he\u2019ll prioritize deportations to focus on gang members, felons, terrorists. Way down the list will be illegal immigrants with a broken tail light, for instance. So even if you can\u2019t qualify for a work permit, you\u2019re less likely that you\u2019ll be subject to deportation if you haven\u2019t committed a serious crime. SIEGEL: So if someone was born in 1975 and brought here at the age of 15 in 1990, under the present terms, they wouldn\u2019t be eligible as DREAMers, but under these new terms, they would be. LIASSON: That is exactly right. SIEGEL: Mara, does the White House think that the president is on strong legal ground doing this? LIASSON: Yes, and they point to other presidents since Eisenhower, including Ronald Reagan and George H. W. Bush, who\u2019ve issued similar orders offering relief to similar percentages of the undocumented population. The White House says, they did reject some measures they felt they didn\u2019t have strong legal justification for, such as the parents of DREAMers \u2013 people who brought their children here illegally. And they said that he couldn\u2019t issue green cards. He couldn\u2019t offer a path to citizenship. And even for people who will qualify for his new deportation relief, they will not be able to get Obamacare subsidies. SIEGEL: Of course, the same percentage of the undocumented population is a much larger number of people because the undocumented population is so much bigger these days. What are Republicans likely to do in response to all of this? LIASSON: Well, they\u2019re looking at a lot of options. They\u2019d like to defund this, but the agency that processes applications \u2013 the Department of Citizenship and Immigration Services \u2013 is self-funded by immigration application fees, so it doesn\u2019t depend on the appropriations process. Still, today on the Senate floor, the incoming majority leader, Mitch McConnell, said that the president would regret doing this and that the Congress is considering a lot of options. SIEGEL: Now, what about the idea that the president could have waited a few months to give Congress one more chance to act on legislation? LIASSON: Well, many Democrats and, even for a brief moment, the president\u2019s old political advisor David Axelrod suggested that in order to give the White House the ability to claim more moral high ground, not look like he was acting imperiously. But the White House had boxed itself in. The president promised to do this before the election, then he changed his mind and said, he\u2019d do it by the end of the year. And he needed to get back in the game, show he was still relevant, show disappointed Latino voters that he\u2019s acting, that he\u2019s fighting for them. And don\u2019t forget \u2013 after the last time he lost a house of Congress in 2010, he did move to the center. He did try to compromise with the Republicans. And he worked for years to get a big budget deal, and that didn\u2019t work out. SIEGEL: Let\u2019s talk about coverage of the speech. The broadcast television networks are not taking it live. LIASSON: They\u2019re not. They saw this as a political speech. They\u2019ve decided to air \u201cGrey\u2019s Anatomy\u201d or \u201cThe Biggest Loser\u201d instead. But one very, very important network, Univision - the network that matters for the White House tonight \u2013 will be covering it. And they\u2019ll even be delaying their coverage of the Latin Grammys to take the president\u2019s speech, and that\u2019s what the White House cares about.

            "article_content": "President Obama announced that he would take several steps on his own regarding immigration issues \u2014 including the tens of thousands of children who have swarmed to the U.S. border in recent weeks.  MELISSA BLOCK, HOST: From NPR news, this is ALL THINGS CONSIDERED. I'm Melissa Block. ROBERT SIEGEL, HOST: And I'm Robert Siegel. President Obama came out to the White House Rose Garden today to plead, once again, for Congress to act on the bipartisan immigration bill the Senate passed a year ago. Since then, it's been stalled in the House. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) PRESIDENT BARACK OBAMA: If House Republicans are really concerned about me taking too many executive actions, the best solution to that is passing bills. Pass a bill. Solve a problem. SIEGEL: The president added that Speaker of the House John Boehner had told him that a vote on ant immigration legislation would not happen until after the November elections. As a consequence, the president said that he would act on his own using his executive authority to change the nation's immigration policy, where he could. NPR's Mara Liasson was in the Rose Garden this afternoon and joins us now. Hi. MARA LIASSON, BYLINE: Hi Robert. SIEGEL: What kind of action is the president talking about? LIASSON: Well, in the short term, he's talking about doing something to deal with the thousands of children, who've massed at the southwestern border, trying to get in illegally. He's going to move some resources from the interior of the country to the border. He's going to work the countries where these kids come from to try to stop the flow. In the longer term - the medium term - he's is asked his attorney general and Homeland Security secretary to give him some ideas about what he can do on his own. He can't make comprehensive of immigration reform happen by executive action. But if he chose to, he could expand the Dream Act, which allows, you know, children brought here legally to get on a pathway to citizenship if they are in college with military. He could perhaps expand that to include their families. But I think today really was a turning point. He was very frustrated. He said he'd given the Republican in the House a year. He's now been told by the Speaker, it isn't going to happen this year. And the President says, now I'm going to move forward on my own because the loss of Eric Cantor to an anti-amnesty Tea Party candidate, the flood of kids at the border - those two things really did put an end to any hopes for immigration reform from Congress this year. SIEGEL: As you said though, President Obama said he spoke with the heads of both the Justice Department and Homeland Security. And one thing he asked them to do is to recommend actions they think will lead to a more secure border. Do we have a sense of the timeline or the scope of those recommendations? LIASSON: He says he wants these recommendations by the end of the summer. We know that he is going to be asking Congress for an emergency appropriation of about $2 billion to address the thousands of kids who are on the border. But we're going to find more - exactly more about what he wants to do in the coming weeks. SIEGEL: Seems like a tough moment for Mr. Obama to be asserting this kind of prerogative because just last week the Supreme Court ruled that he had overstepped his constitutional authority in making high-level recess appointments. LIASSON: That's true. And as the president said today, executive action is never as good as legislative action. It's always preferable. He wanted an immigration bill. He wants a legacy. If he uses executive action, it's not permanent. And also, this has become an issue in the midterm elections. The Republicans call him the imperial presidency, which is - imperial president, which is a little ironic since he's using executive action out of weakness, not strength. But the interesting thing is just as he's getting all these defeats on contraception or on immigration, both of those issues might be, over the long term, winners for the Democrats. It's bad for Republicans to be seen against contraception - bad for Republicans to be seen against immigration reform. SIEGEL: And as for the president's disappointment with the Speaker, Boehner, that he expressed, Boehner's actually suing him - claiming he's exceeding constitutional authority. LIASSON: Yes, there's always tension between Congress and the Executive. But in this case, the overreaching of the president, President Obama himself, are big issues in the midterm campaign. This is a theme for Republicans. It's been a very good couple of weeks for them. The long term might be a little different. SIEGEL: NPR national political correspondent Mara Liasson.

            "article_content": "President Obama is preparing to issue new executive orders on immigration. The White House is considering a wide range of actions, one of which could provide temporary work permits for people who are in the country illegally but still meet certain criteria.  MELISSA BLOCK, HOST: President Obama is preparing to issue executive orders on immigration. They could provide temporary work permits to some immigrants who are in the country illegally. Today the president repeated his promise to do what he can on immigration unilaterally since Congress has not acted. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) PRESIDENT BARACK OBAMA: It continues to be my belief that if I can't see Congressional action, that I need to do at least what I can in order to make the system work better. BLOCK: NPR's Mara Liasson joins us now to discuss what that might mean. And Mara, what about that? What are some of the executive actions that the president is considering? MARA LIASSON, BYLINE: Well, the White House is looking at a wide range of actions. He could provide temporary work permits - that is relief from deportation as long as he is in office for people who are here illegally but meet certain criteria. They've paid their taxes. They have no criminal records. He could provide relief to family members of U.S. citizens. He could provide relief to parents of the dreamers. Those are the young people brought here as children that the president has already provided deportation relief to. He could also decide to increase the number of the legal immigration visas to high-tech and agricultural workers. He has the authority to prioritize deportation. Remember, Congress has only appropriated funds to deport about 400,000 people a year. So the White House is already prioritizing who they deport. BLOCK: And even before announcement of what specifically he will do, there has been pre-reaction coming from all sides, right? LIASSON: That's right. And the people on both sides say there would be a lot of different reactions. Hispanic advocates say the Hispanic community would be ecstatic if he did this. They would be grateful to the president and the Democrats. Republicans on the other hand say that he would be overreaching his authority. Some Republicans have already talked about impeaching the president if he expands deportation relief. The Republican leadership in Congress does not want impeachment to be their position. They feel that would be a political trap that would further alienate the Republican Party from Hispanic voters. But other Republicans are already talking about trying to defund the president's efforts by attaching measures to a must-pass piece of legislation that funds the government after September 30th. So they are threatening a government shutdown over this. BLOCK: And Mara, of course, all of this is coming shortly before the midterm elections. What would be the political effects of all this? LIASSON: There's a lot of debate about that. It's very hard to gain this out politically. The White House thinks not much effect on the midterms either way. They say there's only one battleground state, Colorado, where there's a significant number of Hispanic voters who might be encouraged to turn out for Democrats out of gratitude for the president's executive actions. Republicans say it would energize their base since the child immigration crisis at the southwestern border. Earlier this summer, immigration has become a much bigger issue for Republicans in battleground races. But Democratic operatives say they don't think the Republican base could be any more energized than they are already. Still, red-state Democrats are very nervous about this with the exception of Mark Udall in Colorado. Almost all the Democratic Senate candidates in battleground states have said they do not want the president to do this. BLOCK: So then why would the White House act before the midterms? Would there be much difference between issuing executive orders in mid-September or wait till after the midterm's due in mid-November? LIASSON: Well, that is a good question. And I've been asking it to a lot of people. Here is one political theory about why acting before the election makes sense. If the Democrats lose the Senate, the president will have no political capital left. He'll be at his weakest moment. The Democratic agenda will look kaputt.  But if he does it before, he still has some political clout. And if he wants the clearest possible contrast with the Republicans, in effect daring them to overreact and call for impeachment or a government shutdown, he has to do it this month. He has to do it in September before the continuing resolution that funds the government comes due on September 30th. So if you thought we had put that kind of political brinksmanship behind us, you would be wrong. BLOCK: OK, and Mara briefly, if the midterms aren't the main political calculation for President Obama here, what is? LIASSON: Well, White House aides say the president is playing a longer game. He's thinking about his legacy. These executive orders have the potential to have a huge impact on people's lives, on the U.S. economy and on the next presidential election because Hispanics are the fastest-growing segment of the electorate. BLOCK: OK, NPR national political correspondent, Mara Liasson. Mara, thanks. LIASSON: Thank you. Copyright \u00a9 2014 NPR.  All rights reserved.

            "article_content": "President Obama and presumed Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell talked about finding common ground, the day after Republicans won control of the Senate and picked up seats in the House.  STEVE INSKEEP, HOST: All right, you heard Ailsa use that famous phrase about politicians wanting to get things done, which calls for a follow-up question - which things? NPR White House correspondent Tamara Keith has been exploring what the two parties could agree on. Hi, Tamara. TAMARA KEITH, BYLINE: Hi. INSKEEP: So what are some of those areas? KEITH: Corporate tax reform does seem possible. Transportation spending seems like an area where they could get together, the highway bill is up in the spring, so there's a deadline there to work on it - international trade, authorization of military force against the extremist group Islamic State. There could be some economic development legislation, and I think more broadly, there's an agreement between the president and the leadership in the House and Senate that they want to stop governing from crisis to crisis and cliff to cliff. I spoke with Tom Cole. He's an Oklahoma congressman, a Republican who's close to the GOP leadership in the House. He said Boehner and Mitch McConnell don't intend to waste their majority. They want something to show for it, and he said that getting something done was the real mandate in this election. REPRESENTATIVE TOM COLE: Believe me, the American people are in a firing mood. They showed it in the last several elections, and they will keep firing people until they get a combination that they think produces for them. So I don't think incumbents can sit around and simply throw rocks at one another. If they don't get something done, a lot of them aren't going to be here after the next election. KEITH: And he also figures that the best way to get a Republican president elected would be for Republicans in Congress to show they can govern. INSKEEP: OK, all sounds very nice, common ground and so forth. But President Obama held a news conference yesterday, and he said very directly that he wants to move forward on immigration reform, very awkward issue for the GOP, to say the least. And the president says he's going to act on his own if Congress does not, which congressional leaders say would be a disaster for them. So what would the president do? KEITH: Its more than that. He's going to act before the end of the year. But what the president is talking about doing is sort of a larger version of what he did with the young people known as the dreamers. He will say to some class of people, you know what? You don't have to worry about being deported. He'll give them work permits. It's not clear who this would be or how many people would be affected, but it could be something like the parents of American citizen children or people who are married to American citizens. INSKEEP: Oh, so not everybody, but some wide class of people among the millions of people who are here without proper documents. KEITH: Exactly, and that number that gets tossed around of people who could be affected is about 5 million, but that's not entirely clear. Here's the thing, that is going to make Republicans very, very angry, but they still have an interest in doing something about this broken immigration system. Comprehensive immigration reform probably isn't possible. But they talk about things like legislation on border security or maybe seasonal worker visas or visas for high-tech workers, so there are actually areas where they could work on this. INSKEEP: Well, that's very interesting. So you have President Obama pushing Republicans on an issue that's awkward for them, something may or may not come of it. You also have Republicans pushing the president. We had Cory Gardner, the newly elected Republican senator from Colorado, on the program yesterday. I asked him what can you work with the president on, and he mentioned the Keystone XL pipeline - awkward for the president - changes to the Obamacare - awkward for the president again. Republicans want to push on the president a little bit here. KEITH: Yeah, and in an op-ed this morning, in The Wall Street Journal, Mitch McConnell and John Boehner said that they are, quote, \"renewing their commitment to repeal Obamacare.\" But once they get that out of their system, the sense is that there are some smaller things where there could be agreement on fixes and changes to the health care law. One thing that doesn't get reported all that often is that there were actually, over the last several years, about seven bills passed with bipartisan support and signed by the president that made changes to the health care law. One thing that's getting a lot of talk now is repealing the medical devices tax. President Obama was asked about it at his press conference yesterday, and he didn't outright reject the idea. So there are a lot of ideas being discussed. None of them would actually completely undermine the law. Outside experts say that it's pretty well here to stay. A health care tracking firm called Avalere projects that by the time the next president takes office, 24 million people will have insurance through the exchanges, which makes repeal politically tough and unlikely. INSKEEP: OK, thanks very much. That's NPR White House correspondent Tamara Keith on this Thursday morning. Copyright \u00a9 2014 NPR.  All rights reserved.

            "article_content": "President Obama has begun to try to sell the American public on his controversial executive action on immigration. He started Friday, with a visit to Del Sol High School in Las Vegas.  SCOTT SIMON, HOST: This is WEEKEND EDITION from NPR News. I'm Scott Simon. President Obama's executive action on immigration has certainly been controversial. Supporters may be thrilled, but many immigration activists wish it went further and many opponents say it's an executive overreach of historic proportions, and so the president has begun to try and sell it to the American public. NPR's Tamara Keith reports from Las Vegas, Nevada. TAMARA KEITH, BYLINE: This was President Obama's second visit to Del Sol High School in two years and there was a certain symmetry in his return. It was in the very same gymnasium almost two years ago that he called for Congress to pass a comprehensive immigration overhaul. The Senate ultimately did pass a bipartisan immigration bill, but House Republicans balked and now Obama is back and going it alone on an executive action that could shield some four million people in the country illegally from deportation. (SOUNDBITE OF SPEECH) PRESIDENT BARACK OBAMA: And during that time, families have been separated and during that time, businesses have been harmed and we can't afford it anymore. Las Vegas, I have come back to Del Sol to tell you I'm not giving up. I will never give up. (APPLAUSE) OBAMA: I will never give up. KEITH: The student body at Del Sol High School is heavily Latino and many of the students sitting in the bleachers could be personally affected by the executive action. (SOUNDBITE OF SPEECH) OBAMA: This action doesn't grant citizenship or the right to stay permanently, or receive the same benefits that citizens receive. Only Congress can do that. All we're saying is we're not going to deport you and separate you from your kids. KEITH: At one point during the speech a young man stood up and started yelling to the president that his action didn't go far enough. The crowd shouted him down. (CROWD CHANTING) KEITH: But Obama responded, more or less agreeing. Astrid Silva is what's known as a dreamer. She was brought to the country illegally when she was little and has been a vocal advocate for changing the immigration system. Yesterday she stood on stage and triumphantly introduced the president, but afterwards she said this isn't the end of the story. ASTRID SILVA: Until we have that law signed by the president, families are going to continue being separated, people are going to continue being deported and we can't continue that. We have to make sure that our system is working and is fair to everybody. KEITH: For Obama, the choice of coming here likely isn't purely about symmetry. Nevada is a state he won both in 2008 and 2012 in large part because of strong support from Hispanic voters. DAVID DAMORE: It's a case study in sort of how this country's changing demography is changing the geography of the political competition. KEITH: David Damore is a political scientist at UNLV and also a senior analyst for the polling firm Latino Decisions. Damore says going into the midterm elections Hispanics were turned off by the inaction on immigration. He says for Latino voters, immigration policy isn't abstract. DAMORE: 64 percent of Latino voters had a family member, a friend or a coworker who was unauthorized - so this is their communities. This affects them, this affects their parents, their grandparents. KEITH: Recent polls show the majority of Americans support the policies and the president's executive actions. They don't support him going around Congress. Protesters showed up outside the high school to make their voices heard. Obama's motorcade passed by as it drove up to the high school. Back in Washington, House Speaker John Boehner said he thinks the president is purposely sabotaging comprehensive immigration legislation by taking executive action. (SOUNDBITE OF PRESS CONFERENCE) HOUSE SPEAKER JOHN BOEHNER: We will not stand idle as the president undermines the rule of law in our country and places lives at risk. We'll listen to the American people, we'll work with our members and we will work to protect the Constitution of United States. KEITH: But it's not clear how anything Congressional Republicans do will be able to stop the president's action. Tamara Keith, NPR News. Copyright \u00a9 2014 NPR.  All rights reserved.

            "article_content": "President Obama is planning to use his executive authority to offer temporary deportation relief to certain groups of immigrants. The Republicans say if he does, all bets are off.  RENEE MONTAGNE, HOST: The new Republican Congress and the president are hurtling toward a huge confrontation over immigration. The president is planning to use his executive authority to allow temporary deportation relief to certain groups of people who enter the country illegally. The Republicans say if he does, all bets are off. NPR's Mara Liasson reports. MARA LIASSON, BYLINE: The president says on immigration, he'll keep his promise and act on his own by year's end if Congress does not. But he still prefers that the Republicans pass legislation. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) PRESIDENT BARACK OBAMA: They have the ability, the authority, the control to supersede anything I do through my executive authority by simply carrying out their functions over there. LIASSON: Is that a threat? Republicans sure see it that way. And they have some threats of their own. If Mr. Obama goes ahead, they say, it could impede progress on everything - including the confirmation of a new attorney general or the passage of a bill to keep the government open. Here are the new Republican leaders of Congress, Senator Mitch McConnell and House Speaker John Boehner. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) SENATOR MITCH MCCONNELL: It's like waving a red flag in front of a bull. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) REPRESENTATIVE JOHN BOEHNER: If he acts unilaterally, on his own, he will poison the well, and there will be no chance for immigration reform moving in this Congress. LIASSON: But if Republicans don't move on immigration, will that be because the president stuck his finger in their eye or because they don't have enough Republican votes to pass it? Here's what RNC Chair Reince Priebus told NPR. REINCE PRIEBUS: I don't think there's going to be massive immigration reform or even significant immigration reform unless and until the border is secured. LIASSON: And right now, Republicans haven't agreed on much beyond a general concept of border security, says Tamar Jacoby. TAMAR JACOBY: Look, our side is very divided on this, that - no kidding. To me, the Republicans will be in the strongest position if they can get this behind them before the 2016 election. LIASSON: That's certainly the view of the GOP leadership. But the rank and file is a different story. There's no longer a consensus that a comprehensive bill, one that secures the border and deals with the 11 million people living in the U.S. illegally, is a political necessity for the GOP. Many Republicans see a way to win national elections without passing a bill. Ron Bonjean is a former House leadership aide. RON BONJEAN: Republicans feel very emboldened about the 2014 election, as well they should. Look, some Republicans ran partly based on a anti-amnesty platform. But the 2016 election will be a very different dynamic, and we may end up not achieving the presidency, even with a quality candidate because we haven't done the right things in connecting with the Hispanic vote. LIASSON: But other Republicans say their big victory this year means that in 2016 a quality candidate - say, a fluent Spanish speaker, like Jeb Bush - could make Republicans competitive with Latinos without passing an immigration bill. But if all of that means the political imperatives for the GOP are unclear, for President Obama, they are urgent. Because the president has already postponed his actions on deportation relief once, pollster Matt Barreto of Latino Decision says he has to act as he promised by the end of the year. Otherwise, he won't repair the Democratic Party's ties with Latino voters. MATT BARRETO: We asked a direct question about this, has the delay in executive action made you more or less enthusiastic? And among people who did not vote, 60 percent said the delay in executive action made them less enthusiastic about the president of the Democratic Party. LIASSON: In 2012, President Obama issued executive orders deferring deportations for the so-called dreamers. Baretto says that was the single biggest factor motivating Latinos to vote Democratic. BARRETO: If the president acts to provide more relief to millions of immigrants who are in this country - risked getting deported every day, our polling has suggested that an overwhelming majority of Latinos will become more enthusiastic, that they haven't been lost to the Democratic Party forever. LIASSON: So the White House may feel it has no choice but to move quickly, even though the president's unilateral actions may make it harder to get the kind of legacy legislation he wants or for Republicans to do what might be in their own best political interest. It's shaping up to be a pretty ugly mess, says Tamar Jacoby, who runs a national federation of small businesses in favor of an immigration overhaul. JACOBY: The employers that I work with and I represent are mostly small- to medium-sized restaurants, construction, home health aides, etc. They're really worried about this and scared because they feel that there is no serious negotiation. Imagine negotiating with your husband in public where everyone can hear the ultimatums, and you can't back down from them. I mean, it's just - this is not a way to get anything done. LIASSON: The new Congress hasn't even been sworn in, but there's already a consensus forming that a permanent legislative solution on immigration is not very likely.

A vigilante attack against a Roma teenager has shocked France and put pressure on the French government to improve conditions for the ethnic minority. Human rights advocates say the rise of a xenophobic climate in the country may have contributed to the attack. French news reports say 16-year-old Darius, whose last name has not been released, was found bloodied and unconscious in a grocery cart by the side of the road in a suburb north of Paris. He was kidnapped and beaten by a dozen or so youths who accused him of stealing. President Francois Hollande condemned what he called an unspeakable and unjustifiable act. Aline Le Bail-Kremer, a spokesperson for human rights group SOS Racism, says the incident is not so surprising considering the atmosphere in France today. Darius, the 16-year-old Roma boy who was the victim of a brutal vigilante attack, lived in this camp, Pierrefitte-sur-Seine, outside Paris.\n                \n                    \n                    Thomas Samson/AFP/Getty Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption Darius, the 16-year-old Roma boy who was the victim of a brutal vigilante attack, lived in this camp, Pierrefitte-sur-Seine, outside Paris. \"The fact is the National Front, which is a xenophobic party, won an election in this country and won a lot of gains all over Europe,\" she says. \"And [the attack] is the result of this context.\" The elections she's referring to are recent European parliamentary elections, where the far right came out on top in France. Even before those elections, French governments on both the right and left have been criticized for their harsh dealings and deportation of Roma. The Roma, sometimes referred to as gypsies, migrated to Europe from India during the Middle Ages. They have always faced harsh discrimination across the continent. They began coming in large numbers to Western Europe when Romania and Bulgaria joined the EU in 2007. Roma are part of the landscape in Paris today. Under the Eiffel Tower, there are always gangs of young Roma girls hitting the tourists up for money. J.Z. \u2014 who won't give her full name because she is frightened of the police \u2014 is one of those girls. She and her friends surround me. They carry clipboards with petition-like papers on them, or little cards with notes, like \"I am hungry, I want money,\" scribbled on them. I begin to ask the girls what their lives are like. Soon, our conversation attracts a couple of police officers. They walk up, stop our interview, take the girls' cards and tear them up. The girls say this treatment is common. J.Z. says she doesn't steal. But Roma are often accused of stealing from tourists and Parisians across the city, especially in the subway. Laurent Thebault runs a souvenir stand near the Eiffel Tower. He says the Roma situation is impossible. \"As a shopkeeper, I'm confronted by these girls all summer long. They're often pregnant; they ask for water and steal from me,\" he says. \"But as a human being, I see these people are not able to integrate, and this is the only way they can survive.\" Thebault says people are increasingly nervous because European governments seem to have no coherent plan for the Roma in Europe.",

Decked out in red, white and blue clothing, and waving flags and banners, thousands of supporters of the far-right National Front party marched through central Paris on Thursday \u2014 known as May Day or International Workers Day \u2014 to hear charismatic leader Marine Le Pen. The traditional gathering began, as always, at a gilded statue of Joan of Arc, where Le Pen laid a wreath. The National Front is in high spirits for its annual rally this year. In March, the party won the mayoral races in 11 cities across the country. It hopes to increase its influence by electing National Front candidates to the European Parliament on May 25. The marchers chanted, \"Non to Brussels, oui to la France,\" expressing their disgust with the European Union. There were many young people in the crowd. Twenty-five-year-old Jean Baptiste Vondeville took a bus to the rally with a group from the northern city of Lille. He says this year there's an electricity in the air. Marine Le Pen, France's National Front political party leader, reacts as she attends their traditional rally in Paris on Thursday.\n                \n                    \n                    Benoit Tessier/Reuters/Landov\n                    \n                \nhide caption Marine Le Pen, France's National Front political party leader, reacts as she attends their traditional rally in Paris on Thursday. \"It's different this year because we control 11 towns. And we'll be able to prove to the French people that we're competent and can govern,\" Vondeville says. The insurance salesman believes his party will soon be ready for the ultimate power position \u2014 the French presidency. These people say the European Union controls France's destiny. And they say that years of uncontrolled immigration from Africa and Muslim countries are decimating the country's culture and values. One of the National Front's favorite slogans is \"On est chez nous,\" or \"We are in our home.\" They're also against the new trans-Atlantic trade agreement currently being negotiated between Europe and the United States. One man calls the treaty \"a way for America to colonize Europe.\" Marchers carried flags and banners during a rally for France's far-right National Front party.\n                \n                    \n                    Eleanor Beardsley/NPR\n                    \n                \nhide caption Marchers carried flags and banners during a rally for France's far-right National Front party. Far-right parties are having a resurgence across Europe. Analysts say that's partly because of the economic downturn, dissatisfaction with current leaders, and the belief that immigrants are taking jobs and not assimilating into society. Islamophobic, xenophobic parties in Denmark, Hungary, Austria and the Netherlands have garnered approval ratings above 20 percent. They, too, are hoping for big gains in the European Parliament. On a stage in front of Paris' ornate opera house, the new National Front mayors are introduced to the crowd. After years of being considered a pariah political party, the National Front is now making its way into the mainstream. One reason for that is the party's new leader. As Marine Le Pen takes the stage, the crowd is ecstatic, chanting \"Marine President!\" The brash, bright lawyer and divorced mother of three is credited with modernizing the party when she took over from her father, Jean-Marie Le Pen, three years ago. Today the National Front has more young people and women \u2014 and is no longer considered a party of \"good ol' boys.\" As Le Pen speaks of France's greatness, a massive poster of Joan of Arc looms above her. The symbolism is clear. Just as Jeanne d'Arc delivered her country from English invaders in the 15th century, Marine Le Pen will deliver France from the dictates of its EU masters and fight back the foreign immigrants who would obliterate the French soul. Manuel Rodrigues is in the crowd with his wife. The couple has traveled from Brittany to hear Le Pen. Rodrigues says Le Pen is the only politician capable of getting France out of the mess it's in. \"We love her because she's a patriot,\" he says. \"And France needs that.\" Rodrigues says it's not that he and other National Front members don't like immigrants; it's that they believe foreigners should assimilate better. \"If you're a guest at someone's house you must respect them,\" he says. \"That's all we want.\" Rodrigues says the party isn't racist, just patriotic. He points to his own Portuguese background as proof the party is open. Down the street from the National Front rally, 22-year-old Kevin Ficat is selling bouquets of lilies of the valley, a May Day tradition. Ficat says the party scares him. \"We have to be careful because Le Pen is a convincing speaker and she is able to manipulate people,\" he says. \"More and more French people are for Le Pen,\" says Ficat, \"because they think the country's problems are about foreigners \u2014 black people or Arabs \u2014 but it's not true.\"",
