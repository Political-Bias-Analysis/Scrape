House Speaker John Boehner says he's sure he can make a deal next year with the White House on a comprehensive bill. A steady procession of prominent GOP leaders are warning that Republicans won't win the White House again without improving their outreach to Latino voters. On Monday, Florida Republican Sen. Marco Rubio explained the problem this way. And it's also going to require, I think, outreach by the business community but also by religious leaders to let the most conservative folks know that by being so anti-immigrant, it's just not the right thing to do. John Feehery, a former top House GOP leadership aide \"It's really hard to get people to listen to you on economic growth, on tax rates, on health care, if they think you want to deport their grandmother. It's very difficult to get people to listen to anything else you're saying,\" Rubio said. \"So I think it's critical. There's just common sense involved here in terms of how you portray it. Policy matters, too, but rhetoric is important.\" A comprehensive immigration bill would tackle three problems: border security and workplace enforcement; a revamp of the legal immigration system; and the thorniest issue of all \u2014 what to do with the 11 million people already here illegally. In a warm-up of sorts Tuesday in Washington, two retiring GOP senators \u2014 Kay Bailey Hutchison of Texas and Jon Kyl of Arizona \u2014 took a stab at a tiny piece of immigration reform. They introduced a bill to allow young illegal immigrants to stay in this county legally if they enrolled in college or joined the military, but it would not offer them a path to citizenship. \"We have to get this ball rolling. We have to have a discussion that is sensible, that is calm, that discusses all of the different aspects of the issue, and this particular part of immigration reform seemed a logical place to begin,\" Kyl said. And that might describe in general terms where Republicans decide to plant their flag on immigration. The old debate was amnesty vs. deportation. But that debate is now dead; its funeral was election night. The new debate has a new dividing line: legalization vs. citizenship. \"Republicans have to tread carefully on this. Unless they do a very impressive outreach to the Hispanic community right now, the more people you have to give citizenship, the more people you have voting against you,\" says Republican John Feehery, a former top House leadership aide. \"Certainly the last election proves that. This is a concern of many on the right. They're saying, 'Why would you give citizenship to a bunch of people who are going to vote against you?' \" And that's why, despite a consensus among national Republican leaders, electoral math dictates that the party change its position on immigration reform. The rank and file \u2014 particularly members with safe Republican House districts \u2014 worry more about fending off anti-immigrant primary challengers. \"There are a lot of people who are still very much worried about illegal immigration flowing in, they're very much worried about amnesty,\" says Feehery. \"And so this is going to take a real educational effort to let people understand that there's a policy imperative here. There's also a political imperative. And it's also going to require, I think, outreach by the business community but also by religious leaders to let these folks know, the most conservative folks know, that by being so anti-immigrant, it's just not the right thing to do.\" That outreach is gearing up. Next week, a coalition of conservative business, faith and law enforcement leaders will meet in Washington to build momentum for immigration reform. The debate won't start in earnest until next year. But in the meantime both sides are laying out their bottom lines. Legalization \u2014 short of citizenship \u2014 might end up being the Republicans'. The congressional Hispanic caucus will lay out their principles Wednesday. For them, a path to citizenship is non-negotiable.",

Now she's an undocumented resident living in Alabama, which has one of the country's toughest immigration laws.\n                \n                    \n                    Debbie Elliott/NPR\n                    \n                \nhide caption Maria Lola Melisio, 18, entered the U.S. illegally with her mother when she was 7. Now she's an undocumented resident living in Alabama, which has one of the country's toughest immigration laws. Inside a modest storefront in Loxley, Ala., 18-year-old Maria Lola Melisio points out the Mexican spices and other products for sale in her mother's market. \"There are the leaves where you make your tamales \u2014 you roll them up in that,\" she says. Melisio has long dark curls and is wearing a houndstooth scarf in support of the Alabama Crimson Tide. When she was 7 years old, she entered the U.S. illegally from Mexico with her mother, and still has a scar on her back from crawling under the border fence. It's a story she's kept secret until now. \"We shouldn't have to be embarrassed,\" Melisio says. \"It's really not my fault that I came here illegally. I really didn't know anything.\" She says her mother wanted a better life, \"so we could have a future.\" Tension Between State And Federal Law Now, Melisio finds herself caught between state and federal immigration policy. Alabama's immigration law is often billed as the toughest in the country. In recent years, other states have passed similar legislation intended to curtail illegal immigration, at times running afoul of the U.S. Constitution. But with President Obama's re-election, an immigration overhaul is now back on the national agenda, with calls from both political parties to address the large numbers of undocumented immigrants who call the U.S. home. In the wake of Alabama's law, Hispanic-owned businesses closed, and farmers complained they couldn't find enough migrant workers to harvest their crops. Like Arizona, Alabama's law calls for police to detain suspects on a reasonable suspicion that they are in the country illegally. But Alabama went further, making it a crime for undocumented immigrants to conduct any matter of business, whether private or with government agencies. The law also required schools to collect information on the immigration status of enrolling students and their parents. In 2010, Arizona's immigration law trumped all previous efforts at state-controlled immigration. The state passed the Support Our Law Enforcement and Safe Neighborhoods Act, commonly known as SB 1070. Highly contested, the measure was the broadest and strictest anti-illegal immigration measure in recent history. It also set off a wave of copycat legislation. Once SB 1070 was approved, 36 other states attempted to pass tough immigration-control laws. Of those, 31 rejected the bills, and five \u2014 Alabama, Georgia, Indiana, South Carolina and Utah \u2014 passed measures inspired by Arizona's. While some of those states' laws did in fact copy several of Arizona's provisions, others built upon them. Today, some states are looking toward Alabama's law \u2014 which beat out Arizona's as the strictest in the nation \u2014 as a new model. \u2014 Reema Khrais Source: American Immigration Council, Immigration Policy Center Melisio dropped out of the 11th grade when that measure passed last year. It was only intended to apply to new students, but her mother was too afraid to send her to class. \"She thought that the police would come to school and try to find out who was illegal, and they might send me back,\" she says. \"She was scared, and she didn't want me to go.\" Even after courts struck down Alabama's school provision, Melisio says she was ashamed to return. Now, she needs a high school diploma to qualify under Obama's policy that allows young illegal immigrants to avoid deportation if they go to college or work. She's trying to get her GED just over the state line in Pensacola, Fla. Highly Contested State Laws Civil rights advocates say laws like Alabama's have created a host of problems, while neglecting to really address the question of illegal immigration. \"They do infinitely more harm than good,\" says Tomas Lopez, an attorney at the Southern Poverty Law Center, one of several groups that have sued to stop the state laws. Trying to drive people out of the state is \"not the way to deal with the really complicated questions that are tied up in immigration policy,\" Lopez says. Supporters insist the laws are working. \"I think we did what we intended to do,\" says Republican state Sen. Scott Beason, a sponsor of Alabama's immigration crackdown. \"We did see apparently thousands of illegal aliens leave the state,\" Beason says. \"It did open up jobs for a number of Alabamians, which was really our main goal.\" Beason acknowledges he's become a \"lightning rod\" in the debate, and has experienced pushback from fellow Republicans who complain the law has made it more difficult to do business in the state. \"There are a lot of business interests who like to be able to have that never-ending flow of illegal labor,\" Beason explains. \"And that's been the tug of war within the Republican establishment for a while.\" Beason says he's surprised to now hear national Republican leaders embrace a softer approach in an appeal to Latino voters. \"It seems to me more like petty pandering is what they're trying to do,\" Beason says. \"Instead of telling people this is why: because we want to have better jobs; we want to have opportunity. And to do that we cannot just have completely open borders with millions of people streaming into the country. Let's have that argument.\" At least 10 states have passed these new immigration rules. The most comprehensive statutes come from Alabama, Arizona, Georgia and South Carolina. All have the same underlying goal. \"The concept of attrition through enforcement,\" says Kansas Secretary of State Kris Kobach, a key architect of the immigration laws. \"If state and local government can add their shoulders to the wheel and help to increase the total amount of enforcement,\" says Kobach, \"that will change the cost-benefit analysis of your typical illegal alien who says, 'You know what, it's getting harder for me to work illegally in the United States. It's getting harder for me to get these public benefits, and I'm going to go home.' \" 'Fiscal Burden' On States But courts have ruled that states have only a limited role to play \u2014 that the Constitution leaves immigration policy to the federal government. Here's what states can still do: mandate that employers use the national E-Verify system to check workers' Social Security numbers; authorize police to detain and check the immigration status of suspects; and deny public benefits to undocumented residents. Kobach says that even as the debate moves to Washington, D.C., he will continue to work with states and local governments to find new avenues to curtail illegal immigration. \"The other factor we have to remember here is that the fiscal burden of illegal immigration falls overwhelmingly on the states,\" he says. \"Indeed, illegal immigration can be said to be the ultimate unfunded mandate.\" At Jackson Hospital in Montgomery, Ala., Dr. Randy Brinson says emergency rooms like the one here are the front lines when it comes to the public cost of illegal immigration. He says they treat a lot of migrant workers. \"When they come to the emergency room, we don't check their immigration status, we just know it's someone who is sick,\" says Brinson. \"So the reality is they come in, we take care of them, and we very rarely get compensated for their care.\" Brinson, president of the Christian Coalition of Alabama, says the cost is often passed along to local governments. He thinks the immigration debate in Alabama has missed the point, and harmed the state's already battered image when it comes to civil rights. \"It had the negative effect that we were against immigration, we were against Hispanics in particular, and that we weren't concerned with the plight of illegal immigrants in our country,\" Brinson says. He thinks the solution is creating a path to citizenship and legitimate work with adequate housing, fair wages and family health care benefits. \"Not in the underground, but in the open light,\" Brinson says. \"So that they don't become a burden on the state government or the federal government.\" Brinson says as both parties maneuver to attract Latino voters, the social costs of immigration policy shouldn't get lost in the politics.",

Robert Menendez, D-N.J., and 20 House members make up the Congressional Hispanic Caucus. Here, Menendez speaks in September in Sayreville, N.J. Determined not to be excluded from the post-election bipartisan talk of passing immigration legislation, the Congressional Hispanic Caucus on Wednesday rejected two Republican proposals while outlining its own priorities. The group, currently made up entirely of Democrats, denounced the STEM Jobs Act, delivering a swipe at Republicans on a bill expected to come before the House on Friday as the first test of the GOP's newfound embrace of an immigration overhaul. The bill would increase the number of visas for foreign-born graduates with advanced degrees in science, technology, engineering and mathematics by eliminating another visa program for people from countries with low rates of immigration to the United States. Hispanic caucus members criticized the bill because it would end one visa program and allow relatives of legal residents to come to the U.S. while awaiting their visas, but not authorize them to work. The Hispanic caucus lawmakers support a version written by Democratic Rep. Zoe Lofgren of California that would, among other things, preserve the original visa program. Hispanic lawmakers also criticized the first Republican bill proposed in the Senate following the elections. The ACHIEVE Act, introduced by Sens. Jon Kyl of Arizona and Kay Bailey Hutchison of Texas, is a pared-down version of the DREAM Act, which would offer legal status to young illegal immigrants who serve in the military or attend college. \"The problem with the ACHIEVE Act is it does not achieve the dream,\" said Sen. Bob Menendez, D-N.J., at a news conference on Wednesday. Menendez and 20 House members comprise the caucus. In recent days, Republicans and Democrats in both chambers have begun discussing several immigration bills that could be introduced, potentially competing in the new Congress early next year. On Wednesday, the Hispanic caucus, for which immigration has long been its signature issue, offered its own nine policy priorities in hopes of shaping negotiations. It said legislation should require illegal immigrants to register with the federal government, undergo a criminal background check, learn English and pay taxes as conditions for obtaining legal status and eventual citizenship. Caucus members endorsed conservative priorities such as securing U.S. borders and worker verification, but with carefully worded caveats: \"smart and reasonable enforcement\" on the borders; and \"a workable employment verification system that prevents unlawful employment and rewards employers and employees who play by the rules.\" They also called for full workplace rights and safer working conditions for immigrants, and a priority for reuniting legal residents with family members seeking U.S. entry. \"Let me be clear about this \u2014 we want to work with Republicans to find common ground, help the American people, and help America's immigrants,\" said caucus member Rep. Luis Gutierrez, D-Ill. \"But common ground is based on common decency and common sense. These principles reflect that common decency.\" Many Republicans in the House who have staunchly opposed citizenship for illegal immigrants have remained quiet on the issue in recent weeks. Conservatives and advocates of slowing the flow of immigration believe the caucus's goal of passing an omnibus bill is unlikely in either chamber. \"I don't think comprehensive immigration reform is going to happen, period,\" says Mark Krikorian, executive director of the Center for Immigration Studies, which advocates a lowering of immigration rates. Krikorian says Republicans appear most likely to consider supporting a smaller, targeted bill such as the DREAM Act, because many Americans are \"sympathetic\" to young adults who had no choice in coming here as children. The sticking point for Republicans, he says, will be their desire to add an enforcement provision to the DREAM Act so that the law wouldn't encourage an increase of more illegal immigrants. He recommends mandatory worker verification as one solution. \"I think at some point amnesty for some people is inevitable ... but we have to have in place the mechanisms to make sure we're not in the same boat years from now,\" says Krikorian. \"That's really the public's problem with this issue.\"",

            "article_content": "Paging Jeb Bush. Your party needs you. In the aftermath of Tuesday's election losses, Republicans have been scrambling to formulate a fix for what went wrong. A big part of that calculation involves repairing relations with Hispanics, the fast-growing electoral power base that rejected Republican Mitt Romney's \"self deportation\" immigration solution and voted for President Obama in numbers that exceeded 70 percent. And they'll need help from influential Republicans like Bush. The former Florida governor, a brother and son of former presidents, has long advised his party to take a new tone on Latinos and immigration and to \"get beyond where we are,\" as he said during the GOP convention. The election thumping at the hands of Latino voters was so severe that GOP House Speaker John Boehner stunned his Democratic colleagues by calling for comprehensive immigration reform, something he has not advocated previously. Conservative Fox News host Sean Hannity likewise shocked his followers by advocating a \"pathway to citizenship\" for otherwise law-abiding illegal immigrants, long considered anathema for much of the GOP base. That's plenty evidence that the election is being perceived on Capitol Hill as the equivalent of a Geiger counter that measured a demographic and electoral earthquake under way for some time. And that immigration reform, in some form, will be on the agenda next year. \"I can't imagine that if you're a Republican and have any level of sanity left, that you did not feel this earthquake and want to do something about it before your whole political future craters,\" says former Republican Congressman Henry Bonilla of Texas. \"If it's not obvious now,\" Bonilla, now a Washington lobbyist, says, \"they're idiots.\" What Now? Not only did Obama rack up a presidential victory with a 71-27 percent edge over Romney among Latinos, but on Election Day, Maryland also became the first state to approve by popular vote a measure that allows some undocumented immigrants to pay in-state tuition. Republican forces had worked against the Maryland \"DREAM Act\" effort, as they had for a similar federal bill that was defeated in 2010. The state measure passed with 58 percent of the vote. \"In their partisan, ideological zeal, [Republicans] forgot that Maryland is not Alabama,\" Eliseo Media, head of the Service Employees International Union, said during a Friday conference call with reporters. SEIU worked to help pass the act. Medina says the re-election of Obama, who earlier this year suspended deportations of young, law-abiding illegal immigrants, and the passage of the DREAM Act in Maryland, suggests that comprehensive immigration reform \"is not the third rail of politics; it's the road to the future.\" Republicans, he says, \"need to get right with Latinos.\" He and Frank Sharry, executive director of America's Voice Education Fund, say they envision a big role in immigration reform negotiations for Florida Sen. Marco Rubio, a Republican of Cuban descent. Republican Sens. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina and, potentially, John McCain of Arizona are again expected to emerge as GOP players on the immigration reform issue as they have in the past. As is Republican Rep. Jeff Flake of Arizona, who was just elected to the Senate. As a congressman, Flake joined with Democratic Rep. Luis Gutierrez of Illinois in 2007 to write the House version of comprehensive immigration reform. Sharry also predicted that some \"surprising people\" in the GOP may step up in the Senate, mentioning Republicans Kelly Ayotte of New Hampshire, John Cornyn of Texas and Dean Heller of Nevada. \"If they lock arms and jump together, it's a lot easier,\" Sharry said. \"Neither the House nor the Senate want to be blamed in 2016.\" Graham and McCain are the only Republicans who will still be in the Senate next year who voted for President Bush's comprehensive immigration reform bill in 2007. It failed with 46 voting in favor, 53 \u2014 including 15 Democrats \u2014 voting against. \"A lot of us worked hard to see if we couldn't find common ground,\" Bush said after the defeat. \"It didn't work.\" Make It Work? Reform supporters are looking for Obama to muster the forces needed to raise a new bill. One Hill staffer involved in the issue urged the president to hold a Camp David retreat with Rubio, Graham, Jeb Bush, Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, Boehner, and even New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg. Bloomberg has publicly and forcefully argued that the country can't fix its economy until it reforms its immigration policy. \"I know of no ways to help our economy as quickly and as cost-free as opening up proper ways to people who will come here, create jobs, create businesses, help our universities,\" Bloomberg wrote in an editorial published in Bloomberg News service, which he owns. \"Immigration is what built the country, immigration is what kept this country going for the last 235 years and now we seem to have walked away from it.\" Bonilla, the former GOP congressman, says that it stereotypes Hispanics to assume that immigration reform is all they want to talk about. \"Most Hispanics are concerned with the same issues other Americans are \u2014 the economy, jobs, education,\" he says. \"Similar to Main Street America.\" He says, however, the Romney campaign failed in reaching out to Hispanics in their communities and their homes, and the party failed the community in adopting a strident, ugly tone when talking about the immigrant community. \"The harshness and choice of words can cut deeply,\" he says. \"Republicans need to show compassion and to be reasonable when talking to any ethnic group.\" Election results have begun the conversation. The tone already has changed, at least in the days immediately following the election. And immigration reform will no doubt be on Congress' agenda in 2013. Whether and how it proceeds \u2014 from proposals to reform the system to border enforcement, and perhaps, most sensitively, how to address the 10-12 million illegal immigrants now in the country \u2014 remains far from certain. Will Republicans come to the table? And will Democrats, who have a hold on a voting bloc that will benefit them immeasurably in the future, let them? \"There is pressure on Republicans to change their tune but there is also pressure on Democrats to deliver,\" says Gutierrez, the Illinois Democrat. \"Latino voters put a lot of faith in President Obama and he has another four years because of that faith. But now he has to exert the muscle needed to forge the coalition of mostly Democrats and a few Republicans to get a bill passed and implemented.\"",

Supporters of President Obama partied outside the White House on Wednesday morning, chanting \"Four More Years!\" and \"U-S-A!\" \u2014 and singing off-tune renditions of The Star-Spangled Banner. \"I knew I'd be coming here. I just didn't know whether I'd be coming to protest or to celebrate,\" said AnaLysa Sawyers, 38, a teacher from Maryland. While Obama gave an acceptance speech in Chicago, hundreds of revelers in the nation's capital climbed trees and shouted and danced for news cameras. There were conga lines, homemade signs and impromptu drum circles. For a campaign characterized by a deficit of enthusiasm, there seemed to be plenty of it going around. \"I'm beyond ecstatic right now,\" said Latasha Burns, 36, a Washington, D.C., resident. \"I wasn't expecting so many people, but I'm glad to see the turnout.\" Some in the crowd said they were celebrating not just the election of their preferred presidential candidate, but passage of measures in Maryland and Maine allowing gay marriage; Maryland's passage of its version of the DREAM Act, to extend in-state college tuition rates to some illegal immigrants; and the election of Tammy Baldwin, who will become the first openly gay U.S. senator, in Wisconsin. \"We're thrilled for [Baldwin] to speak on our behalf,\" said Washington, D.C., resident Christine LeMieux, 30, who was waving a rainbow flag with her partner. Some who supported Obama in 2008 said their celebration was markedly different from what they experienced four years ago, upon the historic election of the nation's first African-American president. \"Four years ago, it was like writing history. This year, the story is being completed,\" said Ericka Jeter, 39, a teacher from Maryland.",

He and his Republican challenger, Mitt Romney, will have their first debate at the University of Denver on Wednesday.\n                \n                    \n                    Pablo Martinez Monsivais/AP\n                    \n                \nhide caption President Obama speaks during a campaign event at University of Colorado Boulder Sept. 2. He and his Republican challenger, Mitt Romney, will have their first debate at the University of Denver on Wednesday. Colorado is a good venue for a presidential debate focusing on domestic issues. The first of three highly anticipated debates between President Obama and his Republican challenger, Mitt Romney, will take place Wednesday at the University of Denver. The state is known for its independent voting streak, and much like the rest of the country, there are sharp political divides about the role of government in the economy. In Colorado, those differences grow from two distinct population centers. Tourism-dependent Colorado Springs, home to military bases and evangelical churches, overwhelmingly votes Republican. High-tech and clean-energy jobs, and the outdoor lifestyle has lured young people to the Democratic Denver-Boulder metro area. \"There's no doubt we're better than where we were four years ago. The question is, are we where we should be?\" says University of Colorado business school economist Rich Wobbekind. He says some sectors have been bullish, others sluggish. The state's unemployment rate is slightly higher than the national average. But one important trend has surfaced lately. \"We're adding jobs in the construction sector, and we were losing them at a very rapid pace a year ago,\" Wobbekind says. Skiing, tourism and farming are also starting to stabilize, though the drought could change that. Then there are the large federal research labs and private tech companies that employ thousands in the Golden and Boulder areas, which coasted through the recession, buoyed by increases in federal spending. Aerospace software engineer Trace Baker says he's \"very definitely\" better off now than four years ago, when he was expecting to get laid off. \"But I do have to say, in the context of the current political debate, I'm in better shape because government is spending taxpayer money for the projects I'm working on,\" he says. But like many parts of the country, you'll also hear concerns here that government is doing more to hurt \u2014 rather than help \u2014 the economic recovery. This is especially apparent in the suburbs, where registered independent voters tend to outnumber Democrats or Republicans. Rhonda Rodman of suburban Jefferson County, near Denver, turned up at a \"Women for Mitt\" event recently. She says she considers herself an independent, and has voted for both Democrats and Republicans. \"I have a friend right now who is trying to convince me to ... go back to the other side,\" she says, \"and honestly, I am willing to listen to any argument, if someone's got a good argument, a solid argument, I want to hear it.\" But this fall Rodman, a small-business owner, plans to vote for Romney. She runs a holistic veterinarian business \u2014 a service she says is considered discretionary. \"I'm very much affected by the economy, and I am really concerned about our solvency down the road,\" Rodman says. Both presidential campaigns are actively courting suburbanites and Hispanics, who now account for one of every five Coloradans. They turned out big in 2008 to support then-Sen. Barack Obama, who carried Colorado by nine points. The state Democratic chairman is indicative of who the party is trying to reach out to. Rick Palacio is gay, Hispanic and has a working-class background. At a recent debate, he said Romney's policies would be a setback. \"He would veto the Dream Act if it passed his desk. He's gone so far as to say that the people should self-deport,\" Palacio says. But the economy \u2014 not immigration \u2014 is the main issue this election for Eleanor Carrillo. She's a retired teacher who attended a Hispanic Republican business forum in Jefferson County. \"Because gas prices, food prices, everything's going up, and we see no relief in sight,\" she says. Still, for many in swing states like Colorado and Nevada, immigration and the economy are inextricably linked, though only the economy will likely play heavily in the first debate.",

A 40-year-old father of four, he moved to Greece 20 years ago from Rosetta, an Egyptian fishing village near Alexandria. \"All the fishermen [in Greece] are Egyptian,\" he says. \"Go to any island in the country and listen to the conversations on the boats. You'll hear names like Alim and Mohammad.\" Egyptian fishermen have worked in Greece for decades. Abuhamed speaks Greek fluently and has many Greek friends. The country feels like a second home, he says. In the past two decades, Abuhamed has brought more than 60 relatives and friends to work in Greece. One of them is Abouzeid Mubarak, a 28-year-old father of three young daughters. He arrived six months ago and shared a one-story house with Abuhamed and three other men. On a hot night in June, he moved his bed to the roof terrace. A noise woke him around 3 a.m. He pulled down the bedsheet covering his face and saw 20 men in black T-shirts surrounding him.

United Against Racism and Fascist Violence Movement, an immigrants-support group, says Golden Dawn is behind attacks on hundreds of immigrants to Greece. \"I saw some people \u2014 young, like me,\" he says. \"They hit me, and then I blacked out.\" Hunting Abusers The men beat Mubarak with wooden bats and iron rods, then tried to break into the house where the rest of the Egyptian fishermen were sleeping. Another Egyptian, Mustapha Elhersh, found Mubarak. \"There was so much blood on the terrace \u2014 so much,\" says Elhersh, who's 33 and has lived in Greece for 13 years. \"I thought he'd never make it to the hospital. I thought he would die.\" Mubarak spent weeks recovering. His broken jaw is now wired shut, so he has trouble speaking and eats through a straw. Police have detained suspects, and police spokesman Christos Manouras says the force makes every effort to investigate such crimes. Many immigrants can't afford the fee to file police reports, but they are reporting attacks to human rights groups. One Greek organization has recorded more than 300 vigilante attacks since April. In a recent report, Human Rights Watch also recorded dozens of beatings and stabbings \u2014 some in broad daylight, says senior researcher Judith Sunderland. \"I was shocked on a daily basis by the stories that we heard and the suffering that we found,\" she says. \"We had no idea of the scale. It really does appear to be a daily phenomenon.\" Influence From Extremist Party Sunderland and others suspect some of the attackers may be sympathizers of Golden Dawn \u2014 an extreme nationalist party that wants, in its own words, to clean Greece of immigrants and land-mine the border with Turkey to prevent more immigrants from crossing. In parliamentary elections in June, the party won 18 seats of 300 in parliament. Its members recently left fliers at businesses owned by immigrants in the Piraeus suburbs that demanded that the immigrants leave in a month \u2014 or else. Ilias Panagiotaros, a parliamentary deputy for Golden Dawn, dismisses the connection between his party and the attacks. \"Police records show that about 85 percent of all incidents that have to do with attacks are made by illegal immigrants against Greeks,\" he said. \"This is the one and only truth.\" Golden Dawn gets traction from accusations like this because Greece is a transit point for more than 80 percent of the undocumented migrants coming into the European Union. Earlier this month, Greek police arrested more than 1,600 people, saying they had slipped into the country illegally. They were sent to holding centers and will be deported. Public Order Minister Nikos Dendias compared the immigrants to ancient Dorian invaders and said their uncontrolled entry is leading Greece to \"social collapse.\" Because of EU laws, many migrants get stuck in Athens, where they can't find work. They live in cramped, crumbling apartments or on the streets. Others wait at the port city of Patras to stow away on ferries bound for Italy. More than a million immigrants live in Greece \u2014 about 10 percent of the country's population. About 800,000 live here legally, while more than 350,000 are undocumented. Many of the newcomers are Muslims from North Africa and Central and South Asia. Some Greeks feel threatened and burdened by them, especially as the debt crisis has destroyed the country's economy, says Jan Egeland, Europe director of Human Rights Watch. \"We see that austerity makes all of the things come out of the shadows,\" he said. \"Migrants and minorities are the first to feel this.\" The Egyptian fishermen of Rosetta \u2014 who work here legally \u2014 are certainly feeling it. They're alarmed at how unwelcome they suddenly feel in a country that once embraced them. Abuhamed, the fish shop owner, moved to a new apartment. So has Mubarak, the young fisherman who was almost beaten to death. Fearing more vigilante attacks, Mubarak and his housemates now sleep with iron rods next to their beds.",

They say they are in it to win it, and \u2014 at the very least \u2014 to expand the electoral conversation to include people they say aren't represented by either Democrats or Republicans. Amid waving green and white campaign signs in a conference room at a Baltimore Holiday Inn, the room erupted in cheers as Dr. Jill Stein won the delegate count. She laid out her platform, called the Green New Deal, which she says includes a series of emergency reforms. The plans range from declaring a moratorium on foreclosures to forgiving student loan debt and creating millions of community-based jobs in worker cooperatives, public transportation and in clean energy. \"The Green New Deal ends unemployment in America,\" she said. Stein blasted Republicans and Democrats alike, including President Obama. She's accused the Democrat of embracing the policies of his Republican predecessor. She also called his recent relaxation of policy for young undocumented immigrants a \"pre-election about-face.\" \"The Obama White House has been the most anti-immigrant administration in a century,\" she said. In fact, Democrats bore the brunt of the criticism here, though folks like Bob Marsh of California think both so-called mainstream parties are to blame for the nation's woes. \"The Democrats are more responsible because we all know that the Republicans represent Wall Street,\" he says.

Stein has qualified for federal matching funds \u2014 the first Green Party presidential candidate to do so in its 11-year history. Party officials are hoping to spend up to $2 million on the presidential race alone. Stein had an answer for those who worry that the Green Party could tip battleground states against Obama.

Bush. \"It's a convenient scapegoat and it's a convenient public relations campaign to try to suppress the voice of the opposition,\" she said.

Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney softened his tough primary-campaign tone on immigration, if not his positions, during a speech Thursday to national Hispanic leaders. In comments to thousands gathered at the National Association of Latino Elected and Appointed Officials in Orlando, Fla., the former Massachusetts governor criticized President Obama's failure to take action on comprehensive immigration reform. And he characterized Obama's decision last week to bypass Congress and defer deportation of many young illegal immigrants as an election-year sop to Hispanic voters. The president's action, Romney said, is \"a temporary measure that he seems to think will be just enough to get him through the election.\" \"After 3 1/2 years of putting every issue \u2014 from loan guarantees for his donors to cash for clunkers \u2014 before immigration, now the president has been seized by an overwhelming need to do what he could have done on Day One,\" Romney said. \"I think you deserve better.\" Before last week's action, Obama had resisted calls to use his executive authority to halt deportations of young illegal immigrants and allow them to apply for legal work permits. He's scheduled to speak Friday at the 29th annual conference \u2014 the first sitting president to do so. He'll come in riding a wave of Hispanic support for last week's action, a move that polls suggest has strong support as well from the nation at large. A Bloomberg poll released this week showed that 64 percent of likely voters agreed with the president's policy. On Thursday, Romney did not answer the question of whether he'd let the deportation deferral stand, instead saying he'd pursue his \"own, long-term solution.\" And he did not reverse his promise to veto Dream Act-type legislation that, like Obama's action, would give conditional residency to young illegal residents of good standing. Facing a decidedly cool audience \u2014 Obama won 67 percent of the Hispanic vote in 2008 \u2014 Romney chose to focus on how the Latino community has been walloped by the recession, including an unemployment rate that at 11 percent is 2.8 percentage points higher than the national average. He urged those gathered to ask the classic election-year question: Are you better off now than you were four years ago? \"I believe he's taking your vote for granted,\" Romney said, noting that Obama failed to fulfill his 2008 promise of comprehensive immigration legislation \u2014 even as he enjoyed Democratic majorities in the House and Senate for his first two years. \"You do have an alternative,\" Romney said. \"Your vote should be respected.\" \"Is the America of 11 percent Hispanic unemployment the America of our dreams?\" Janet Murguia, president and CEO of the National Council of La Raza, the nation's largest Hispanic advocacy group, said Romney's speech felt like a pivot in the right direction. \"In many respects, Romney is digging himself out of a hole when it comes to Latino voters, and it felt like he was trying to do that,\" said Murguia, who is in Orlando for the conference. But she said Romney could have gone further in explaining how he would reform the nation's immigration system and what he envisions for the more than 11 million undocumented immigrants already in the country. \"I think he missed an opportunity to talk about the undocumented workers, and about the Dream Act students,\" she said. \"He dipped his toe in the water, but this audience was ready for more.\" Mark Krikorian, executive director of the Center for Immigration Studies, a nonpartisan group that advocates limited and legal immigration, said he heard little new in Romney's remarks, which were politely if tepidly received. (He drew a few scattered boos when he advocated repealing Obama's health care legislation.) \"Most of it was the usual stuff \u2014 he wants more high-skilled immigrants, he wants a Green Card to come with an advanced degree, he says that legal immigrants are welcome,\" he said. \"He's talked about all that before.\" One new element, he said, was Romney's proposal to exempt from immigration caps the spouses and minor children of legal permanent residents. \"The main thing for him was to come across as not unacceptable,\" Krikorian said. \"The fact that he pulled it off could be considered a success.\" La Raza's Murguia said Romney's pledge to seek a bipartisan, long-term solution to immigration issues \"felt like an olive branch.\" And she said his comments on the economy resonate with Latino voters. \"The point he made on the economy is part of his strong case for being elected,\" she said. \"But I think he still has a ways to go to capture the hearts and minds of Hispanics.\" Romney wound up his speech recounting his father's American experience \u2014 coming to the U.S. as a 5-year-old after his parents returned from living in Mexico, growing up in a boom-and-bust home and becoming a car company chief and governor of Michigan without a college degree. \"This is my father's story,\" he said. \"But it could be the story of almost any American.\" There are estimated to be 21 million-plus eligible Latino voters in the U.S. In 2008, 9.7 million Latinos voted; some projections put their potential turnout this year at more than 12 million. Increasingly, the story of America will be their story, something Romney acknowledged just by being in Orlando on Thursday, and in his comments. \"Your voice,\" he said, \"is more important now than ever before.\"",

Obama announced illegal immigrants younger than 30 who are brought to the U.S. as children and who meet other standards will not be subject to deportation. That's an important goal of those who support the DREAM Act, a bill long stalled in Congress. The president's action has implications for as many as 800,000 young immigrants \u2014 as well as a rising star in the Republican Party. Before Obama's move, Sen. Marco Rubio, a Florida Republican, was planning to present Congress with his own version of the DREAM Act. A Surprise Move Like many so-called Dream Acters \u2014 young immigrants brought to the U.S. as children \u2014 Frida Ulloa says she was taken by surprise by the president's announcement Friday. She says she realized something was up when she was deluged by text messages. \"I turned on the news and I heard the news and I was like, 'Oh my God,' \" Ulloa says. \"I was so shocked, I was crying.\" Ulloa, 23, is a senior at Florida International University in Miami and an illegal immigrant. She came to the U.S. with her parents from Peru when she was 15. Days after the president's announcement, Ulloa is still excited that after years of meetings and demonstrations, Obama listened to the Dream Acters and removed the threat of deportation. There are some Hispanics, however, who are critical of the president's decision \u2014 none more so than Rubio, a Cuban-American from West Miami. \"I don't think that there's anyone watching this that doubts that it was for political reasons,\" Rubio said in an appearance on Fox News this week as part of a publicity blitz to promote his new autobiography, An American Son. For months, Rubio said, he was working to craft a compromise bill that would allow Dream Act kids to stay in America without granting them a path to citizenship. Out Of Bounds? That's exactly what Obama accomplished last week. In doing so, Rubio says, he believes Obama overstepped his constitutional authority. At the same time, Rubio says, the president lessened the chances that Rubio and others in Congress can craft a bipartisan consensus on the DREAM Act and immigration reform. \"He's basically taking a very significant issue that needs to be solved in a long-term way that's measured, reasonable and balanced and deciding by edict, by fiat, basically, to solve it in the short term, which happens to coincide with the November election,\" Rubio says. DREAM Act advocate Ulloa says Rubio's response has left her puzzled. Before he was a senator, she says, he told her he would support the DREAM Act. Since then, he has changed his position on the bill. And Ulloa says Rubio's talk about a compromise has gone nowhere. \"He says that he's going to do something, but he hasn't really shown us what he's planning on doing. And to criticize this move, I don't understand it, you know?\" Ulloa says. Falling Short Of The Dream? With Obama's executive action, Rubio's effort at building a compromise appears dead for now. In some ways, that may let him off the hook. The chances that he'd be able to convince conservative Republicans in an election year to support a bill to help young illegal immigrants was always somewhere between unlikely and impossible. But there are many in the Republican Party with a lot riding on Rubio and the possibility that he can appeal to Hispanic voters \u2014 either as a future leader or on the bottom half of a presidential ticket with Mitt Romney. Miami political consultant Ana Navarro says Republicans have work to do if they hope to win the Hispanic vote away from Obama. \"What Republicans are going to have to do is focus on immigration and the fact that [Obama] didn't deliver on his entire promise,\" Navarro says. \"He made a promise to give us a diamond ring, and after three-and-a-half years of waiting, and seeing that we were falling out of love with him, he showed up with a cubic zirconium.\" Until Friday's announcement, there was lots of evidence that Hispanic voters \u2014 who were an important part of Obama's margin of victory four years ago \u2014 had lost much of their enthusiasm for the president. A chief concern was the administration's tough deportation policy, as well as its failure to turn around the lagging economy. A new survey released by the polling group Latino Decisions shows the power of the presidency. With his move to halt certain deportations, the survey shows enthusiasm among Hispanics for Obama has jumped dramatically \u2014 more than a 50-point turnaround from earlier in the year.",

            "article_content": "The Greek government is cracking down on undocumented migrants ahead of next weekend's elections. This week, it said it would forcibly evict those migrants living in overcrowded apartment blocks, calling them \"dangerous to public health.\" But immigrant groups say it's a xenophobic ploy to get votes ahead of the May 6 elections.  SCOTT SIMON, HOST: The economy is still the biggest issue for Greeks in next weekend's early parliament elections. But polls show that immigration is also high on the list. Politicians are responding by cracking down on undocumented migrants. Joanna Kakissis has the story from Athens. (SOUNDBITE OF PROTESTERS SPEAKING THROUGH MEGAPHONES) JOANNA KAKISSIS, BYLINE: About a thousand people are gathering a run-down square in central Athens. They include Greeks, Afghans, Pakistanis and Nigerians. They are speaking at an anti-racism rally. They say politicians running for parliament are demonizing immigrants to get votes. Javet Islam is the leader of the Pakistani Community of Greece. He's lived and worked in Athens for 16 years. JAVET ISLAM: They want to show to the Greek persons, we are only caring about you. And that's why we're going to allow to beat them, to kick them, to throw them out. But this is very bad political. This is not politics. The politics is to solve of the problems, to not to create the problems. KAKISSIS: Leading in pre-election opinion polls are all saying the same thing, that Greeks must take back their cities from illegal immigrants. Many politicians blame the migrants - many of whom are from Africa and South Asia - for a rise in violent crime and the spread of diseases like tuberculosis and HIV. The government is evicting migrants living in abandoned and overcrowded buildings. It's also building 30 detention camps to keep migrants until they're deported. The European Union says about 90 percent of undocumented migrants enter Europe through Greece. Police spokesman Thanassis Kokkalakis says that more than 100,000 people entered Greece last year alone. Many end up desperate and jobless in central Athens, he says. THANASSIS KOKKALAKIS: (Foreign language spoken) KAKISSIS: Right now, the center has a lot of problems, like street crime, he says. We have to find solutions. We can't manage this many undocumented people. If their numbers increase, it will keep unsettling Greek society and later the rest of Europe. KOKKALAKIS: (Foreign language spoken) KAKISSIS: But Eva Cosse of Human Rights Watch says what's also unsettling is the rise of anti-immigrant attacks in the last two years. Cosse recently visited a young Somali woman who said she was attacked by vigilantes in central Athens. EVA COSSE: Many people know that in Greece there are economic problems, poverty, but very few people talk about attacks, and even Greeks are not aware of this phenomenon. KAKISSIS: That's because few migrants report attacks, she says. Javet Islam, the Pakistani leader, says he hears about at least 10 attacks a day against Pakistanis, who never report the crime to police. Polls show Greeks are more worried about crime against Greeks. Kokkalakis says that more than 60 percent of people arrested for crime in Athens are undocumented immigrants. (SOUNDBITE OF PROTESTERS) KAKISSIS: But the perception that violent immigrants are violent has fueled the rise of Chrysi Avgi, or Golden Dawn. They're an extreme-right party whose supporters chant that Greece belongs to the Greeks. A spokesman, Ilias Panagiotaros, says Golden Dawn supporters have been policing areas in central Athens that he says illegal immigrants have taken over. ILIAS PANAGIOTAROS: That's what the rest of the people are watching and seeing. And that's why Golden Dawn is going up. And we are going up every day. KAKISSIS: Polls show that the party could win a seat in parliament on May 6. For NPR News, I'm Joanna Kakissis in Athens. Copyright \u00a9 2012 NPR.  All rights reserved.

            "article_content": "President Obama says he wants to take on immigration reform in a second term. Some Republicans say the GOP must drop its opposition to broaden its base, but it's not clear Republicans in Congress will agree.  MELISSA BLOCK, HOST: The election results may also boost prospects for immigration reform. Exit polls show Latinos made up a record 10 percent of the electorate and tilted overwhelmingly Democratic. In his victory speech this morning, President Obama said he wants to fix the immigration system, and Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid has already put it high on his to-do list. NPR's Jennifer Ludden has that story. JENNIFER LUDDEN, BYLINE: When he was Mr. Obama's chief of staff, Rahm Emanuel famously called immigration reform the third rail of American politics. This past summer, when the president moved to stop deportation for many young, illegal immigrants, Democrats feared a backlash. But Frank Sharry, of the immigrant advocacy group America's Voice, says not only did that not happen, the election results prove it a smart move. FRANK SHARRY: I think Democrats are going to feel newly emboldened on the immigration issue. They're going to lean into it. They're going to press the issue. I think the question is whether Republicans are going to rise to the occasion or not. LUDDEN: He says election eve polling shows that Hispanics' first concern is jobs and the economy, but a close second is immigration reform. In fact, a number of Republican analysts are urging their party to get with the new demographic reality. In The Wall Street Journal today, an editorial calls on the GOP to leave its anti-immigration absolutists behind. Again, Frank Sharry. SHARRY: If they don't, I think they'll pay a price in 2014 in the midterm elections. And as many of my Republican friends say, they may not see the inside of the White House for a generation. LUDDEN: But that wasn't the message from new senator-elect Ted Cruz, a Hispanic and Tea Party favorite from Texas. On CNN, he was asked what message his party should take from the lopsided Latino vote. SENATOR-ELECT TED CRUZ: At the end of the day, the president should enjoy his victory. But what I think it says going forward is we remain a nation very, very divided. LUDDEN: Remember, Cruz said, Americans also elected a Republican House. Others cited a different kind of existential threat to the GOP. Steve Camarota of the Center for Immigration Studies opposes legalizing the undocumented. He says Hispanics have always leaned Democratic. STEVE CAMAROTA: There's no question if immigration is allowed to continue, including in amnesty, that will put an end to the Republican Party. But that's not the reason they lost this election. LUDDEN: Camarota says there are much larger ships at play. The fast-growing Hispanic population, he says, may be the least of the Republican Party's problems. CAMAROTA: The fraction of the US population that's single or that reports that their secular or that is receiving some kind of government transfer, welfare or other has all been increasing. And they are populations that do not tend towards the Republican Party. LUDDEN: Camarota says Hispanics were only a small slice of the swing state votes that mattered this year. Of course, others point out it was a crucial slice and one that will be bigger four years from now. Jennifer Ludden, NPR News, Washington. Copyright \u00a9 2012 NPR.  All rights reserved.

            "article_content": "Many conservative faith leaders are among those calling for immigration reform. They joined government leaders on Wednesday in Washington, D.C., to map out what that reform could look like, calling it a moral as well as economic issue.  MELISSA BLOCK, HOST: Conservative leaders from around the country are in Washington to push for immigration reform. Republicans were stung by the lack of support from Hispanics in last month's election. Now, these leaders argue immigration reform is not only a political imperative but a moral one. NPR's Ted Robbins has the story. TED ROBBINS, BYLINE: They describe themselves as a coalition of Bibles, badges and business - conservatives who want to reform the nation's immigration laws beyond what's been proposed by Republicans in Congress so far. Richard Land is head of the conservative Southern Baptist Convention's ethics and policy arm. He supports legalizing the estimated 11 million undocumented immigrants currently in the country. After background checks, fines and a probationary period, Land says they should get the chance to become citizens. He also supports the so-called DREAM Act for those brought here illegally as children. RICHARD LAND: They've broken no law. They're innocent bystanders. They were brought here by their parents, and normally, we don't punish children for their parents' transgressions. ROBBINS: For Richard Land, it's a biblical obligation. LAND: Fair and just immigration reform is first and foremost a moral issue. God has a definite opinion about how we treat the strangers in our midst. ROBBINS: Mark Curren is sheriff of Lake County, Illinois, outside Chicago. Curren says undocumented immigrants came lured by jobs and lax immigration enforcement. Once a hard-liner, the sheriff says it's time to deal with them humanely. SHERIFF MARK CURREN: So a conversion took place for me from having been somebody who was anti - certainly illegal immigrant to somebody that recognizes the hard truth. ROBBINS: Immigration reform is also political. Otherwise, the 250 or so conservatives and Republicans at this strategy session would not have met in Washington. Restaurant owner Brad Bailey came from Texas to tell Republican lawmakers that if they want conservatives to govern, they need to improve on the 27 percent Hispanic vote Mitt Romney got in November. BRAD BAILEY: I've been up here the last couple of weeks since the election, and we're talking to congressmen and senators that would never even meet with us. Their staffs wouldn't meet with us. Now, they're wanting to sit down and talk to us, which is very, very encouraging. ROBBINS: Now, Bailey says politicians on the right have to stop bashing immigrants publicly. BAILEY: Privately, a lot of these elected officials and congressmen and senators will tell you, oh, I understand you can't deport 12 million people. I understand you can't do this. But then they get a microphone in their mouth at a rally, and they start spewing, you know, rhetoric. We need to hold their feet to the fire. ROBBINS: Bailey says he needs immigrant labor to run his restaurant. Farmers say they need immigrants to pick crops. High-tech companies say they need educated immigrants to infuse new ideas. What about Americans who need jobs? One participant said many undocumented immigrants already have jobs. They're part of an underground economy, which doesn't contribute as much as it could to the nation's tax base. Yesterday in Dallas, the last Republican president to get a sizeable Hispanic vote spoke on immigrant contributions to the economy, but then as a former governor of Texas, a border state, George W. Bush was always moderate on this issue. PRESIDENT GEORGE W. BUSH: As our nation debates the proper course of action relating to immigration, I hope we do so with a benevolent spirit and keep in mind the contribution of immigrants. ROBBINS: The rhetoric appears to be softening on immigration at least this week. The test, of course, is how soon that may translate into a coalition of conservatives, moderates and progressives to actually pass legislation. Ted Robbins, NPR News. Copyright \u00a9 2012 NPR.

For many full-time employees in the United States, the five-day work week, paid overtime and holidays are expected benefits. This wasn't always so, and many workers' benefits today are the achievements of labor unions. Just five decades ago, unions were on the frontline of the fight for the rights and wages of the middle class. But today, unions are on the decline. After World War II, organized labor represented a third of America's workforce. Today, only 12 percent of the overall workforce belongs to labor unions both public and private. About 37 percent of the public sector workforce belong to unions as opposed to only 7 percent in the private sector, but they're now in the cross hairs of cash-strapped states and cities. This month, Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker celebrated after winning a recall election that was triggered when he curtailed public union collective bargaining. Similar anti-union efforts took place in Indiana and Ohio. Voters in Ohio later repealed a law that would limit collective bargaining for some public-sector unions, but unions in many states are still at odds with government. So if unions decline, where does that leave the middle class? The Power Of Unions Marcus Oladell, a 62-year-old from East Hartford, Conn., has been a bus driver in the area for about 15 years. Just 12 years ago, he helped form a union of school bus drivers with the Teamsters. Since unionizing, he tells weekends on All Things Considered guest host Jacki Lyden, starting wages for drivers have doubled to $16 an hour. Before unionizing, senior drivers were given raises of a just a nickel an hour. \"If they ever tried to give us a nickel raise now, we'd be walking,\" Oladell says. \"So we had no holidays, now we're up to eight a year. In our last contract, which we never had before, there was a longevity bonus given to members there for 10, 15 and 20 years.\" While the workers are not getting rich, Oladell says, no one could argue the unions have raised the standards compared to what they had just 12 years ago. Oladell became shop steward of his local for the Teamsters. He now travels across the country helping organize bus yards like his. \"The generation behind us has to get an understanding of how powerful a union can be,\" he says. \"If that middle class is going to be strong, it has to be represented by unions. Unions And The Middle Class Middle class wages, at least for the majority of people, are the invention of American unions, says Harold Meyerson, a political columnist for The Washington Post and an editor-at-large at The American Prospect. He says if big labor dies, then America's middle class dies with it. In a recent column, Meyerson points to the decades after World War II, a time of shared prosperity, when productivity and median household income both increased by over 100 percent. It was also a time of peak unionization. \"This had an effect on non-union workers as well,\" Meyerson tells Lyden. \"Non-union workers in industries that were heavily unionized, ... their employers had to compete with union employers. This raised wages for everyone.\" As unions have declined, Meyerson says, the average wage in some sectors has fallen \u2014 in some cases dramatically. In the auto industry, unionized jobs once paid upward of $28 an hour. He says workers in both union and non-union plants are now hired at about $13 to $15 an hour, and in some cases can't earn more than $19 an hour. Without a middle class helped by unions, Meyerson says, the U.S. would continue down a path of massive inequality of wealth and low levels of mobility. \"People are not moving up the economic ladder now,\" he says. \"We would have real decline in wealth because people's income isn't keeping up, so most of their wealth is in their homes ... [and] people have lost two decades worth of value on their homes. We would have a really strapped middle class.\" This, in fact, is what we have now, he says. Tough Choices For Cities Public-sector unions have grown as cities and the demand for services has expanded. That's where the crisis comes in, especially as the economy has fallen. On the same day as the tumultuous recall vote in Wisconsin, two California cities \u2014 San Diego and San Jose \u2014 were voting on measures to force city workers to pay more for their pensions. In San Jose, Democratic Mayor Chuck Reed took on the unions. Reed pushed for a new law requiring workers to pay more for their pensions. He estimates that in the first year the measure would save the city about $25 million a year, but it would eventually save billions in the long run. It passed resoundingly, but the unions say in a lawsuit that the measure is anti-union. As a member of the traditionally pro-labor Democratic Party, Reed had to weigh the political consequences of his decision. \"I think this is a choice that is very difficult for Democrats to make,\" he tells Lyden. \"But it is a choice between providing services to the people or providing benefits to our employees. It's a choice Reed says all Democrats will be faced with as they deal with rising pension costs across the country. The Road Ahead The way forward is difficult for cities and unions. Central Falls, R.I., a city in bankruptcy, got the state to help pay pensions owed to police and fire retirees. They faced losing as much as 55 percent of their benefits. Meyerson says it might be hard for people to have sympathy for union workers, even in public-sector jobs. \"It's a real problem since most private-sector workers have lost pensions of yore and have 401(k)s or nothing,\" he says, \"and they're asked to support others.\" One thing that is certain is that both public-sector and private unions will continue to be a topic for politicians during the next five months as we head toward a tumultuous Election Day.",

            "article_content": "President Obama travels to Florida Friday to address a large gathering of Latino politicians \u2014 one week after announcing that illegal immigrants who came to this country as children will be allowed to stay in the U.S. for at least two years. Republican White House hopeful Mitt Romney criticized that policy when he spoke to the same group Thursday. The twin speeches highlight the important role Latino voters could play in the November election.  STEVE INSKEEP, HOST: It's MORNING EDITION, from NPR News. Good morning. I'm Steve Inskeep. RENEE MONTAGNE, HOST: And I'm Renee Montagne. When President Obama addresses a large gathering of Latino politicians later today in Florida, he's likely to get a warm reception. Just last week, Mr. Obama announced that hundreds of thousands of young illegal immigrants who came to this country as children can stay in the U.S. - at least temporarily. Republican presidential hopeful Mitt Romney criticized that policy when he spoke to the same group yesterday. The twin speeches highlight the important role that Latino voters could play in the November election. NPR's Scott Horsley reports. SCOTT HORSLEY, BYLINE: Mitt Romney can't afford to write off the Latino vote. But he's also worried about offending conservatives whose support he courted during the GOP primaries with a hard line against illegal immigration. Yesterday, Romney tried to tiptoe through that minefield with a vague promise to find a permanent fix for immigration. And he criticized President Obama's temporary reprieve for young illegal immigrants as a cynical, election year stunt. (SOUNDBITE OF SPEECH) MITT ROMNEY: After three-and-a-half years of putting every issue from loan guarantees to his donors, to Cash for Clunkers, putting all those things before immigration, now the president has been seized by an overwhelming need to do what he could have done on day one, but didn't. I think you deserve better. HORSLEY: Many of the Latino politicians in Romney's audience weren't buying it.  Denver City Councilman Paul Lopez complains it was the Republicans in Congress who blocked immigration reform. They also filibustered the so-called DREAM Act, which would have given young illegal immigrants a path to legal status. PAUL LOPEZ: Everybody knows the reason why the DREAM Act and comprehensive immigration reform doesn't move forward is because we have a bigoted group of Republicans that won't get out of the way. They know that if Latinos become citizens and educated, that means they'll vote, and that means that the Republican Party has no future in this country. HORSLEY: Colorado is one of the swing states where Latino turnout could be a significant factor in November. Nationwide, Latinos voted two to one for Mr. Obama in 2008, and their share of the electorate has increased in the years since. Romney has acknowledged that challenge, and he told the Latino politicians yesterday while they don't agree on everything, they do share common goals. Union leader Eliseo Medina was skeptical, saying Romney's immigration tap dance left too many unanswered questions. ELISEO MEDINA: He is not the candidate for the Latino community or for America. He still doesn't get what the average worker is going through. He doesn't get what Latinos are going through. And I think that we need to make sure people know so they can make their choice. HORSLEY: Medina's largely Latino union of service employees just launched a major effort to register and mobilize voters in eight battleground states, including Colorado, Virginia and Florida. While immigration is a hot-button issue, Dallas City Councilwoman Pauline Medrano stresses that it's not the only thing Latino voters are concerned about. PAULINE MEDRANO: We're kind of different, but we're no different from all other ethnic groups, where the economy has hit us bad, jobs. We want quality education, like everyone else. HORSLEY: In fact, Romney got a polite round of applause yesterday when he promised to give low-income parents more choice in the schools their children attend.  He also tailored his standard critique of the president's economic stewardship, noting that Latino workers have been hit particularly hard during the downturn. (SOUNDBITE OF SPEECH) ROMNEY: I'd ask each of you to honestly look at the last three-and-a-half years and ask whether we can do better. Is the America of 11 percent Hispanic unemployment the America of our dreams? We can do better. HORSLEY: That argument may have swayed some people in the audience yesterday.   School board member John Vargas of Hawthorne, California was impressed by Romney's speech, and says some of his friends are now willing to give the Republican hopeful a second look. JOHN VARGAS: I think it resonated with a lot of people - more than I expected actually, from this crowd, which is traditionally more of a Democratic lean. But I think he did a really good job. HORSLEY: Mr. Obama will make his own pitch for support to the Latino politicians this afternoon, no doubt highlighting his new immigration policy. Neither candidate can ignore this fast-growing slice of the electorate, especially in a race that's expected to be so close. Scott Horsley, NPR News, Lake Buena Vista, Florida.

            "article_content": "President Obama traveled to Florida on Friday to speak to NALEO, one day after Mitt Romney addressed the same group of Latino elected and appointed officials. The president stressed his differences with Romney on immigration, including his week-old policy against deporting young people who were brought to the U.S. illegally by their parents.  MELISSA BLOCK, HOST: From NPR News, this is ALL THINGS CONSIDERED. I'm Melissa Block. ROBERT SIEGEL, HOST: And I'm Robert Siegel. More than 12 million Latino Americans are expected to cast votes in November. That would be a big jump from the less than 10 million who did so in the last presidential contest four years ago. President Obama and his Republican challenger, Mitt Romney, both have their eyes on those votes, and both spoke to a convention of Latino politicians in Florida this week, making their case. As NPR's Scott Horsley reports, there was no question who got the warmer reception. SCOTT HORSLEY, BYLINE: Polls show President Obama enjoys a big advantage with Hispanic voters and he tried to build on that today, telling a national gathering of Latino politicians about his efforts to boost grants for college students, cut taxes for small business owners, and extend health insurance to nearly all Americans. PRESIDENT BARACK OBAMA: There will always be plenty of stubborn opposition in the way that says no, you can't; no, you shouldn't; don't even try. But America was built by people who said something different, who said yes, we can; who said, si, se puede. And as long as I have the privilege of being your president, I will be alongside you fighting for the country that we together dream of. HORSLEY: The sustained ovation for Mr. Obama overwhelmed the polite applause that greeted Mitt Romney yesterday. Mr. Obama reinforced his support among Latinos with his announcement a week ago that his administration will stop deporting illegal immigrants who came to the U.S. as children. Instead, these young people will be allowed to stay in the country legally for at least two years and will also be eligible for work permits. OBAMA: And I refused to keep looking young people in the eye, deserving young people in the eye, and tell them, tough luck, the politics is too hard. HORSLEY: Mr. Obama resorted to executive action after congressional Republicans filibustered the so-called DREAM Act, which was designed to give young illegal immigrants who grew up here a path to citizenship. Romney has criticized the president's action as a mere temporary stop-gap. Mr. Obama pushed back at his rival today. OBAMA: In his speech he said that when he makes a promise to you, he'll keep it. Well, he has promised to veto the DREAM Act, and we should take him at his word. HORSLEY: Republican Senator Marco Rubio of Florida spoke shortly before the president. Like Romney, Rubio accused Mr. Obama of playing politics with the Latino vote. SENATOR MARCO RUBIO: I was tempted to come here and tell you, hey, he hasn't been here in three years. What a coincidence, it's an election year. HORSLEY: Rubio acknowledged that immigration is complicated and he warned people on the right and the left both try to oversimplify the issue for political gain. RUBIO: As long as this issue of immigration is a political ping-pong that each side uses to win elections and influence votes, I'm telling you, it won't get solved. HORSLEY: Mr. Obama insists he's ready to work with lawmakers on a permanent immigration fix. But in the meantime, he says, halting deportations of young people was the right thing to do, and for this audience of Latino leaders, at least, it was also the right message to send.

            "article_content": "Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney is in Los Angeles, where he'll do an interview with the Spanish-speaking U.S. network Telemundo. He'll also speak to the Hispanic Chamber of Commerce's annual convention. Later this week, he'll be in Miami for a forum on the U.S. Spanish-language network Univision.  RENEE MONTAGNE, HOST: Mitt Romney is here in Los Angeles today, where he'll be interviewed on Telemundo and then give a speech to the Hispanic Chamber of Commerce. Later this week, he'll be in Miami for a forum on Univision TV. NPR's Ari Shapiro reports on Romney's latest attempt to woo skeptical Hispanic voters. ARI SHAPIRO, BYLINE: The U.S. Chamber Of Commerce tends to lean Republican. Hispanic voters tend to lean Democratic. So the Hispanic Chamber of Commerce could be a perfect place for Romney to convince some people in the middle to step into his camp. Javier Palomarez is the group's CEO. JAVIER PALOMAREZ: To a large extent, the things that we worry about as a Hispanic business community are universal: access to capital, the need to continue to grow our businesses. SHAPIRO: The fact is, there's no way that Mitt Romney will win an outright majority of Hispanic votes. In 2008, 67 percent of Hispanic voters went for Barack Obama. Just 31 percent chose John McCain. But if Romney moves that even a little bit, it could make a big difference in states like Florida, Colorado, Nevada and others. Republicans are putting a lot of weight behind nudging that dial. At their convention in Tampa, there were Spanish speakers on stage every night, including Craig Romney, talking about his father. CRAIG ROMNEY: (Spanish spoken) SHAPIRO: Marco Rubio and Susanna Martinez told only-in-America stories. Rubio is a senator from Florida and Martinez is the governor of New Mexico. SENATOR MARCO RUBIO: We're united not as a common race or a common ethnicity. We're bound together by common values. GOVERNOR SUSANNA MARTINEZ: This is America. In America, todo es possible. (APPLAUSE) SHAPIRO: Rubio and Martinez demonstrate that the Hispanic community is not a monolith. He's Cuban-American. She's Mexican-American. Demographer William Frey of the Brookings Institution says Hispanics of different backgrounds have very different voting patterns. WILLIAM FREY: In 2004, the Hispanics in Florida voted Republican. And in 2008, they voted Democratic. And what happened between 2004 and 2008? A big movement of non-Cuban Hispanics to the State of Florida, especially Puerto Ricans from the New York and Northeast metropolitan areas. SHAPIRO: Puerto Ricans were particularly pleased that this president appointed one of their own to the Supreme Court, Sonia Sotomayor. The Obama campaign has a new Spanish ad featuring a woman who describes herself as a Boricua, slang for Puerto Rican. (SOUNDBITE OF AD) SHAPIRO: She says Mitt Romney opposed Sotomayor. He offended me when he when he stated he would have voted against her nomination. Democrats gave their Hispanic up-and-comers prime speaking spots at their party's convention too. San Antonio Mayor Julian Castro gave the keynote address. MAYOR JULIAN CASTRO: The president took action to lift the shadow of deportation from a generation of young law-abiding immigrants called Dreamers. (APPLAUSE) SHAPIRO: Many saw that presidential directive helping young immigrants as an overt play for the Hispanic vote. And the Gallup poll does show the president maintaining the wide lead he had among Hispanics in the 2008 election. Immigration has been a challenging issue for Romney. He used the term self-deport during the primaries, when rival Newt Gingrich called him the most anti-immigrant of all the candidates. Romney defended himself at a CNN debate in Florida. MITT ROMNEY: My father was born in Mexico. My wife's father was born in Wales. They came to this country. The idea that I'm anti-immigrant is repulsive. SHAPIRO: Romney has also tried to reach Hispanics by emphasizing issues other than immigration. A Gallup poll in June found that health care was the top concern cited by Hispanic voters. Unemployment came in second, with immigration third. So this Spanish ad the Romney campaign released last week focused on health care. (SOUNDBITE OF AD) SHAPIRO: The ad accuses the president of cutting Medicare. Romney has also argued that his business-oriented approach would create more jobs, including for Hispanics. Romney may never convince Hispanic voters that he is more immigrant-friendly than President Obama. But if he's seen as the champion of health care and jobs, for many Hispanic voters that may be enough. Ari Shapiro, NPR News. Copyright \u00a9 2012 NPR.  All rights reserved.

            "article_content": "On the eve of oral arguments in an important immigration case before the U.S. Supreme Court, the issue came to Capitol Hill. On Tuesday, Democratic Senator Charles Schumer convened a Senate hearing on the controversial Arizona law.  ROBERT SIEGEL, HOST: From NPR News, this is ALL THINGS CONSIDERED. I'm Robert Siegel. MELISSA BLOCK, HOST: And I'm Melissa Block. Tomorrow in the Supreme Court, a major immigration case. The justices will hear arguments on the constitutionality of Arizona's tough immigration law. Today, Democrats in the Senate held a hearing on the same topic. NPR's Tamara Keith explores why. TAMARA KEITH, BYLINE: There are 11 members of the Senate Subcommittee on Immigration, Refugees and Border Security. Only two of them showed up, both Democrats. Arizona Republican Jon Kyl was among those who skipped it. SENATOR JON KYLE: This was either an attempt to influence the court decision, which would be improper, or simply to create a political sideshow. KEITH: A sideshow that would allow Democrats to bolster their standing with Latino voters at a time Republicans are trying to close the gap. And the witness list - it was tilted against Arizona's law, too. New York Democrat Chuck Schumer is chairman of the Senate subcommittee. He says he invited lots of elected officials from Arizona, but all of them declined. SENATOR CHARLES SCHUMER: If you believe in the law, if you voted for the law, if you're enforcing the law, why can't you come and defend it? KEITH: Arizona Governor Jan Brewer is in Washington today, ahead of tomorrow's Supreme Court hearings. And she was among those who turned down the invitation, saying it was a political stunt. The only witness who came to defend the law was the author of the bill, former State Senator Russell Pearce, who was ousted from office last year in a recall vote. He says his son, a deputy sheriff, was wounded in a gun battle with illegal aliens. RUSSELL PEARCE: I've seen the real cost and damage caused by the presence of illegal aliens in this country. KEITH: Under grilling from the two senators in attendance, Pearce insisted that Arizona was simply enforcing federal immigration law because the federal government was failing to do it. The other three witnesses raised concerns, that the law hurt the Arizona economy, that it made victims reluctant to report the crimes to police, that it led to racial profiling. Former U.S. senator from Arizona Dennis DeConcini made it clear he is no fan of the law. DENNIS DECONCINI: I'm embarrassed for my state. I apologize for Arizona's actions towards our Latino community - legal or illegal. This is not a way to treat people. KEITH: Pearce, the man behind the law, wasn't buying any of it. PEARCE: I'm a little disappointed when folks talk about embarrassed for the state of Arizona. Two-to-one across this country we have a national crisis, and yet everyone wants to ignore that - the cost, the damage, the crime. KEITH: And therein lies one area of agreement that emerged from the hearing, that there is a problem with the nation's immigration system just crying out for a comprehensive fix. Senator Schumer pointed to the empty seats around him as a sign of how hard that could be. SCHUMER: We need people to sit down, people on both sides of the aisle in a bipartisan way and solve this problem. We have been unable to find negotiating partners. KEITH: But instead of reaching out, Schumer announced at the hearing that he wants to force a vote on a bill to prevent states like Arizona and others from enacting their own immigration enforcement laws. SCHUMER: States like Arizona and Alabama will no longer be able to get away with saying they're simply helping the federal government, quote-unquote, to enforce the law when they are really writing their own laws. KEITH: And that's a move that would force members from both sides of the aisle to take a stand on the highly charged issue of illegal immigration, ahead of the November election.

            "article_content": "GOP presidential candidate Mitt Romney beat former House Speaker Newt Gingrich by a commanding margin of 14 points Tuesday night. Rick Santorum and Ron Paul, who barely campaigned in the state, came in third and fourth.  RENEE MONTAGNE, HOST: It's MORNING EDITION, from NPR News. I'm Renee Montagne. STEVE INSKEEP, HOST: And I'm Steve Inskeep. Newt Gingrich went down railing against the Republican establishment. Republican leaders did prove their ability to win, or at least to beat Gingrich in Florida. Republican money, advertising and harsh remarks from the former speaker's one-time colleagues dragged him down. Mitt Romney captured 46 percent of the vote, winning by 14 points. Rick Santorum and Ron Paul were far behind. Here's NPR national political correspondent Mara Liasson. MARA LIASSON, BYLINE: Romney's victory in Florida was decisive, but it was also expensive and nasty. When he spoke to his supporters in Tampa last night, Romney addressed the tone of the campaign. The Democrats, he said, have been watching. (SOUNDBITE OF SPEECH) MITT ROMNEY: They like to comfort themselves with the thought that a competitive campaign will leave us divided and weak. But I've got news for them: A competitive primary does not divide us. It prepares us. And we will win. (SOUNDBITE OF CHEERING AND APPLAUSE) LIASSON: Electability has been one of Romney's main arguments. And if his loss to Gingrich in South Carolina poked a hole in that claim, Romney repaired it with his big win in Florida. Exit polls showed that nearly half of Florida Republicans said the ability to win in November was the quality that mattered most to them. Here's how Joanne Harries of Miami described her decision. JOANNE HARRIES: They've got to win, and I just thought that Mitt Romney had a better chance to - beating Obama. LIASSON: In Florida, though, more than anything else, Romney's overwhelming financial advantage helped him win. His campaign and his superPAC buried Gingrich under an avalanche of negative ads, outspending Gingrich by at least 5-to-1. According to the Campaign Media Analysis Group, Romney had 13,000 ads on Florida TV, while Gingrich had 200. Pollster Andy Kohut said that is the most important lesson of this primary. ANDY KOHUT: Money matters. Thirty-nine percent of the people that were polled said that advertising mattered to them. Romney won that group by a 52-29 percent margin. Among the other people who said that advertising didn't win, it was a toss up. (SOUNDBITE OF RALLY) UNIDENTIFIED GROUP: Newt. Newt. Newt. Newt. LIASSON: But Newt Gingrich, despite his double-digit defeat, was far from giving up. With supporters waving signs reading: 46 States to Go, he promised to fight all the way to the convention in Tampa and predicted he would be the nominee. (SOUNDBITE OF SPEECH) NEWT GINGRICH: And you might say: How are we going to do that? Well, the same way that we came back in June and July, and by December we're ahead in the Gallup Poll nationally by 12 or 13 points with no money. It turned out that if you have ideas and you have solutions and you have a history of actually doing something in the past, that the combination begins to reach the American people. LIASSON: Gingrich said the race is now down to two people: A true conservative and a Massachusetts moderate. The only major voter group Gingrich won yesterday were Republicans who described themselves as very conservative, voters like Jane Hayes, a retired teacher from Milton, Florida. JANE HAYES: Republicans that are conservative need to get the message to the establishment, that - don't give us weak candidates. You gave us McCain, and he was weak. You gave us Dole, and he was weak. You gave us Romney, and he's weak. And somewhere along the line, we have to stop and say: no more. LIASSON: But it's hard to see where Gingrich can go in the upcoming round of states for a victory. Nevada and Arizona have big Mormon populations, and Michigan is Romney's home state. Other smaller states hold caucuses in February, but caucuses favor organization of the kind Gingrich lacks. Also complicating the race are Santorum and Ron Paul, who can hurt Gingrich by dividing the anti-Romney vote. Still, former Republican strategist Dan Schnur says if Gingrich can't beat Romney, he can keep him busy and distracted. DAN SCHNUR: And the longer he decides to stay in the race, the more of a potential aggravation and annoyance that is to Romney. Romney will be in a very commanding position. But if Gingrich starts to win primaries come March, when the campaign trail moves to the South, he can make this a competitive primary again. As long as he's still breathing, he's a potential competitor to Romney. LIASSON: And, Schnur says, Romney has other work to do. He has to repair the damage the primary campaign has done to his image. SCHNUR: Going through this type of fire in the spring will make him a better and more well-prepared candidate for the fall. The downside is for him is that he's been forced into statements that are going to come back and hurt him in a general election campaign. LIASSON: Statements about immigration, his taxes and his work at Bain Capital have all caused Romney's favorability ratings to drop, particularly among independent voters. Now Romney has to deal with that, while continuing the fight with Gingrich. But the Romney campaign is hopeful, because in national polls and in key swing states, Romney is still tied with President Obama. Mara Liasson, NPR News. Copyright \u00a9 2012 NPR.

Voisin/The Washington Post/Getty Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption At the Casa de Maryland main building in Hyattsville, Maryland immigration advocates gathered on election night to watch the results come for question 4, The Maryland Dream Act and the race for the President. The Maryland Dream Act, which allows undocumented students to pay in-state tuition, will stand. With a 58 to 42 split, voters rejected a measure that sought to overturn legislation passed by lawmakers last year. Inside Higher Ed reports: \"The measure is expected to affect about 435 students in each entering class. When it was originally passed in March it was predicted to cost the state $3.5 million by 2016, an analysis by the Maryland Institute for Policy Analysis & Research, which anticipates an overall positive economic impact because the students helped by the Dream Act are likely to earn more money and therefore pay more in taxes. \"'This is a wise investment,' said Kristin Ford, communications director for Educating Maryland Kids. 'It's not just good for kids, but it's also good from an economic standpoint.' \"Ford said the key to the campaign was educating voters. Once people understood the measure, she said, they tended to support it, but it was important to emphasize that it wasn't a handout or a special scholarship.\" A national version of the Dream Act has enjoyed popular support, according to polls, but it's become a deeply divided political issue. So much so that President Obama bypassed Congress and used an executive order earlier this year to call off the deportation of young illegal immigrants. Many credit that move with helping Obama win a huge part of the Hispanic vote. Exit polls showed that the president enjoyed a 40-point lead with Latino voters. Another notable number from the exit polls: Sixty-five percent of Americans polled said \"illegal immigrants working in the United States [should] be offered a chance for legal status.\" Only 28 percent said they should be deported. This is an important issue that you'll be hearing about for some time to come, especially as it relates to the future of the GOP. If you remember, during the Republican primaries Mitt Romney was forced to take harsh position on immigration. His call for \"self deportation\" haunted him during a \"meet the candidate\" event sponsored by the Spanish-language network Univision. Another thing to keep in mind: Latinos are the fastest-growing voter group in the country. Yesterday, they made up 10 percent of voters, so for the GOP, it gets harder and harder to win national elections without moderating that Latino gap. The big question then becomes whether Republicans will moderate their views on issues like the Dream Act and immigration.",

            "article_content": "It was an election that, once upon a time, many thought was stacked in Mitt Romney's favor. Unemployment was hovering around eight percent, a number that was much higher in black and Latino households. Many had simply given up and stopped looking for work, pessimistic about the future. Voters were still skeptical or fearful about President Obama's health care plan, and small business owners were bracing for what they thought would be higher costs. Overseas, a civil war raging unabated in Syria, resulting in the deaths of thousands, was threatening to upend the entire Middle East. And yet Romney didn't win. The popular vote count was pretty close: 50.5 percent for Obama, 48 percent for Romney. Almost, but not quite, a split down the middle. The two-point-plus spread made it the fifth closest presidential election in more than a century \u2014 trailing only Kennedy-Nixon 1960, Bush-Gore 2000, Nixon-Humphrey 1968 and Carter-Ford 1976. But it wasn't close in the Electoral College. With Florida now finally called, Obama finished with 332 electoral votes \u2014 62 more than the 270 needed to put him over the top. (Romney received 206.) Three hundred thirty-two electoral votes may not be something to write home about (it's 33 fewer than what he got four years ago), but it's more than any Republican got since George H.W. Bush in 1988. And think of all that transfixed us in the days and weeks leading up to Nov. 6, those elusive and hard-to-predict \"battleground states.\" With the exception of North Carolina, Obama carried every single one: Nevada, Colorado, Iowa, Wisconsin, Ohio, New Hampshire, Virginia and Florida. And what accounts for this result? According to leaders of the Tea Party and others on the right, the reason why the GOP suffered on Nov. 6 is because Romney was too moderate. C'mon, we have to blame SOMEBODY!\n                \n                    \n                    Ken Rudin collection\n                    \n                \nhide caption In a Washington news conference the day after the election, longtime conservative activist Richard Viguerie argued that Romney had no core conservative principles, and flatly stated, \"The battle to take over the Republican Party begins today.\" The Los Angeles Times' Robin Abcarian writes that Viguerie called for the resignation of the entire GOP leadership for its \"epic election failure of 2012.\" He singled out RNC chair Reince Priebus, House Speaker John Boehner and Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell. And that wasn't all: \"In any logical universe,\" Viguerie said, \"establishment Republican consultants such as Karl Rove, Ed Gillespie and Romney campaign senior advisors Stuart Stevens and Neil Newhouse would never be hired to run or consult on a national campaign again and no one would give a dime to their ineffective 'super PACs.'\" Also attending the news conference was Jenny Beth Martin, the national coordinator of the Tea Party Patriots. Like Viguerie, she wasn't happy: \"What we got was a weak moderate candidate handpicked by the Beltway elites and country-club establishment wing of the Republican Party. The presidential loss is unequivocally on them,\" she said. Not everyone on the right buys that argument. According to Abcarian's article, conservative columnist Michael Barone \"told an audience at Hillsdale College's center in Washington that the tea party, while bringing some talented politicians to the fore, also brought some 'wackos and weirdos and witches.'\" Barone singled out Todd Akin, the unsuccessful GOP Senate candidate in Missouri, and Richard Mourdock, who performed the same role in Indiana. It's always been a two-edged sword in assessing the role played by the Tea Party in Republican victories and defeats. The movement was undeniably significant in the GOP's House takeover in 2010, responsible as much as anyone for the Republican pickup of 63 seats. But it may have also cost the party the Senate as well that year, as weak and/or flawed Tea Party candidates in states such as Nevada (Sharron Angle) and Delaware (Christine O'Donnell) turned likely Republican victories into crushing defeats. Tea Party favorites: Bachmann (Minn.) barely survived; Mourdock (Ind.) lost a previously safe GOP seat; West (Fla.) refuses to concede.\n                \n                    \n                    Ken Rudin collection\n                    \n                \nhide caption Indiana's Mourdock, who trounced longtime GOP Sen. Dick Lugar in this year's May primary, never got his footing with moderates and independents. After beating Lugar, he said he would model himself after South Carolina Sen. Jim DeMint, a Tea Party favorite. He promised to be \"confrontational\" on key issues. And, in a direct slap at Lugar's reputation for working out deals with Democrats, Mourdock said, \"I don't think there's going to be a lot of successful compromise. I hope to build a conservative majority in the U.S. Senate so bipartisanship becomes Democrats joining Republicans to roll back the size of government.\" Mourdock lost to Democrat Joe Donnelly. Nor did Missouri's Akin go into the general election talking compromise. A no-nonsense conservative, he helped save the career of vulnerable Democratic incumbent Claire McCaskill by getting embroiled in a controversy over \"legitimate rape\" and pregnancy. His comments \u2014 along with those of Mourdock and a few others \u2014 became Democratic talking points throughout the country, resulting in a huge night for Democratic women. Akin himself was buried in a landslide. But it would be a mistake to pin the defeats of 6 November on the Tea Party. In Wisconsin, former four term Gov. Tommy Thompson defeated Tea Party opposition during the GOP primary and then promptly lost in the general election to Rep. Tammy Baldwin, a strong liberal. Conservatives insist that a candidate with better right-wing bona fides would have won. In New Mexico, ex-Rep. Heather Wilson (R) touted her moderate credentials but she got crushed by Democrat Martin Heinrich in the battle for an open Senate seat. And no one can blame the defeat of Sen. Scott Brown in Massachusetts on the Tea Partiers. (Though if Brown lost because of the weight of Obama strength in the commonwealth, how do you explain the victories of Heidi Heitkamp in North Dakota or Sen. Jon Tester in Montana, two states that Romney carried handily?) It was also a mixed scorecard for the Tea Party in the House. Some, like Allen West in Florida, found that their penchant for controversy may have cost them their seats (West trails Democrat Patrick Murphy by 1,907 votes but refuses to concede). Others, like Michele Bachmann in Minnesota, escaped by the barest of margins. But the Republican Party kept their majority and may have held their net losses to single digits. Many Tea Party candidates won re-election and lived to fight another day \u2014 a surprise to some, given that there was talk about 2012 being a \"correction\" from the 2010 Republican tsunami. Many of the GOP defeats came as a result of redistricting, not a backlash to the Tea Party. In Illinois, Democrats were in complete control of redrawing the lines and promptly defeated Reps. Joe Walsh, Robert Dold, Judy Biggert and Bobby Schilling (though, in fairness, the controversial Walsh, a Tea Party favorite, was probably doomed no matter how his district was drawn). In California, new district lines certainly helped push Raul Ruiz over Rep. Mary Bono Mack (R) in the 36th CD. At this writing, two other California Republicans, Dan Lungren (7th CD) and Brian Bilbray (52nd CD), trail their Democratic opponents. (By the same token, Republican-controlled redistricting in North Carolina is probably responsible for the GOP adding three more seats to their total.) In trying to determine what exactly happened to the Republican Party, focusing on the Tea Party may be missing the bigger point: the changing demographics of the country. Obama won women by 11 points. He took 71 percent of Latinos, 73 percent of Asians, 93 percent of blacks. Sixty percent of voters under 30. Once upon a time, winning the white vote by a 61-39 percentage \u2014 as Romney did \u2014 would be enough for victory. Those days may be gone. The great strides the Republican Party made in the midterm election of 2010 were not repeated in the national election of 2012. And if we are going to pin the blame on Romney, as the Tea Party suggests, it may not be because he was too \"moderate.\" Yes, he seemed to have found his footing during the first debate, Oct. 3 in Denver, and moved to the middle. But many of the positions he took in the final month of the campaign were at odds to the more conservative ones he took earlier, especially during his fight for the GOP nomination. Yes, one needs to take conservative stances during the Republican primaries and then move to the center for the general election. But Romney had a history of moving back and forth, starting with his 1994 challenge in Massachusetts to Sen. Ted Kennedy. In the eyes of many, there never was the sense of who the authentic Mitt Romney really was. It was a problem for him when he squared off against his fellow Republicans and it was a problem in the fall. It wasn't that he was too moderate, or too conservative. It was a question of which was the real Romney. No better illustration of this problem was how Romney addressed illegal immigration during the primaries and caucuses. He tore into GOP rival Rick Perry over his policy of allowing undocumented students to pay in-state tuition at Texas colleges. He said he would veto the Dream Act. He even talked about \"self-deportation.\" Now, this is all well and good when the electorate is overwhelmingly white, as it was (and is) during the primaries. But it's more problematic for the general election. And the results have been alarming for the party. California and New Mexico, with their huge Latino populations, may be lost causes for Republican presidential candidates for years to come. Puerto Ricans in Florida, who lean Democratic, are outvoting pro-Republican Cubans in the Sunshine State. Obama has now won Colorado, with its surging Hispanic presence, twice in a row. Ten percent of the voting population is Latino, a number that is only going to grow. Former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush is among those leaders in the GOP who have been trying to send the message that a new approach is desperately needed. (Watch for Sen. Marco Rubio of Florida to gain greater prominence and visibility.) Too moderate? Too inconsistent? Too inauthentic? The Republican Party will be debating Mitt Romney's pluses and minuses as they try to regroup for the 2014 midterms and, of course, to try and recapture the White House in 2016. That campaign has already begun. Electoral Vote Contest. Back in September, I asked for predictions on the nation's electoral vote totals for Obama and Romney. The person coming up with the exact total of EVs would get a Political Junkie t-shirt (in case of a tie, the first person to send his or her correct total would get the shirt). As it turned out, 19 people accurately said that Obama would finish with 332 electoral votes to Romney's 206. But the first was David Driscoll of Stanford, Calif. And the shirt is his. (Congrats, but no shirt, go to the 18 others who also got the correct numbers: Will Thanhouser of Washington, D.C.; David Long of Baltimore, Md.; Yoichi Hariguchi; David Wohl of Tucson, Ariz.; Jeff Ewener of Toronto, Ontario, Canada; Alex Dalton of Montpelier, Va.; Lance LaPointe of St. Petersburg, Fla.; Joshua Downes of Sarasota, Fla.; Alexis Yee-Garcia of Berkeley, Calif.; Matthew Bond of Nashville, Tenn.; Kent Borg of Cambridge, Mass.; Daniel Schrider of Bloomington, Ind.; Paul Whalen of Fort Thomas, Ky.; Joshua Holman of Havelock, N.C.; Chris Bradley of Westfield, Ind.; Lawana Gibson of Winter Springs, Fla.; Corey Hunt of Bethany, Mo.; and Andrew Ujdak of South Bend, Ind.) Still uncalled. With Rep. Mary Bono Mack (R-Calif.) conceding defeat, there are five House races yet to be officially decided. Here are the latest totals as of Sunday: Ariz. 02: Rep. Ron Barber (D) leads GOP challenger Martha McSally by 330 votes. Ariz. 09: Kyrsten Sinema (D) leads Vernon Parker (R) by more than 4,700 votes in this new district. Calif. 07: Rep. Dan Lungren (R) trails Democratic challenger Ami Bera by 1,779 votes. Calif. 52: Rep. Brian Bilbray (R) trails Democratic challenger Scott Peters by 1,334 votes. Fla. 18: Rep. Allen West (R) trails Democratic challenger Patrick Murphy by 1,907 votes. Incumbents defeated (thus far). In addition to Sen. Scott Brown (R-Mass.), these congressional incumbents went down to defeat on Nov. 6: Republicans (13): Mary Bono Mack (Calif.), David Rivera (Fla.), Joe Walsh (Ill.), Robert Dold (Ill.), Judy Biggert (Ill.), Bobby Schilling (Ill.), Roscoe Bartlett (Md.), Chip Cravaack (Minn.), Frank Guinta (N.H.), Charlie Bass (N.H.), Nan Hayworth (N.Y.), Ann Marie Buerkle (N.Y.), Quico Canseco (Texas). Democrats (10): Pete Stark (Calif.)*, Howard Berman (Calif.)*, Joe Baca (Calif.)*, Laura Richardson (Calif.)*, Leonard Boswell (Iowa), Ben Chandler (Ky.), Kathy Hochul (N.Y.), Larry Kissell (N.C.), Betty Sutton (Ohio), Mark Critz (Pa.). *lost to fellow California Democrats.

            "article_content": "In Arizona, some people who couldn't vote had a personal stake in getting others to the polls. Young undocumented immigrants walked neighborhoods in the Phoenix area, looking for citizens who support one piece of legislation which could change their lives.  STEVE INSKEEP, HOST: Stating the obvious, young undocumented immigrants could not vote yesterday. But some young people in the U.S. without legal status found a way to participate. They walked neighborhoods in the Phoenix area, building support for legislation that could change their lives. Here's NPR's Ted Robbins. TED ROBBINS, BYLINE: In this Central Phoenix Hispanic neighborhood of small homes and bright sunshine, a man knocking on your door with a clipboard and a yellow vest does not necessarily mean good news. LORENZO SANTILLAN: Sometimes they think that I'm the person that's going to evict them from their apartment or whatever. ROBBINS: Lorenzo Santillan wasn't there to evict anyone. He was there looking for voters. SANTILLAN: I'm trying to make sure that there's people that support the DREAM Act, to support us and vote in our voice because we don't have one. ROBBINS: When he was nine-months old, Lorenzo's father illegally brought him to the U.S. from Mexico. He's 25 now, a high school and community college graduate, still without documents. If the DREAM Act becomes law, Lorenzo could be eligible to stay in the U.S. legally and become a citizen. (SOUNDBITE OF BARKING DOGS) UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN: (Foreign language spoken) SANTILLAN: (Foreign language spoken) UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN: No. SANTILLAN: (Foreign language spoken) ROBBINS: This lady says she thinks her family members who can vote, did. Lorenzo is working off a voter list which says they haven't voted yet. So he leaves some DREAM Vote literature. (SOUNDBITE OF FOOTSTEPS) ROBBINS: Down the block, Rosie Diaz is home. She's 20 and she voted for President Obama, who supports the DREAM Act. That is, after activists like Lorenzo convinced her it was important. ROSIE DIAZ: It felt good. Yeah, definitely felt good. Like I wasn't going to vote, like I said it didn't make a difference to me but now it's like, oh, like I contributed to something that's, like, huge. ROBBINS: All Lorenzo wants is to work legally as a chef. SANTILLAN: Well, I want to cook, that's all I want to do. But if I have to stray away to make sure that the Latino voice is heard, then I'm going to do that because we need this, just as bad as we need air. You know, for us it's the only way to citizenship and we want the right to vote and we want the right to make our voices heard, basically. ROBBINS: In other words, since he couldn't vote, Lorenzo Santillan had to find others to vote on his behalf. Ted Robbins, NPR News, Phoenix. Copyright \u00a9 2012 NPR.  All rights reserved.

By now, it's no surprise that most Latinos plan to vote for President Obama. They are the nation's largest minority group, often likened to a sleeping giant that could decide the outcome in key swing states. But will enough Latinos show up on Election Day to make good on the prediction? As many as 60,000 Hispanics reach voting age every month, but Latinos overall have yet to bring their full force to the voting booth. Two-thirds of eligible whites and African-Americans voted in the 2008 presidential election, while barely half of Hispanics cast ballots. This year, declined voter registration and tepid enthusiasm among Hispanics have complicated the Obama campaign's efforts to rally minorities against Republican Mitt Romney and his polling advantage with white voters. Add the concerns about obstacles posed by new photo identification requirements, voter roll purges and demands for proof of citizenship, and it all casts doubt on whether Latino turnout will reach the goal of 12.2 million set by Hispanic advocacy groups. That would mark a 26 percent increase from 2008, when Latinos set a record of roughly 9.7 million votes cast. On Thursday, leaders of the organizations said that after conducting registration drives in targeted battleground states, they expect turnout to hit the mark, which would be a record. \"We are very confident the number will grow to 12 million,\" Clarissa Martinez de Castro, of National Council of La Raza, told reporters on a conference call. \"There's a lot of excitement on the ground. Just like more of the voters are paying more attention to the election, Latinos are as well, and we are very encouraged by the registration numbers.\" Economics Vs. Demographics Some polls show Obama leading Romney among Hispanics by 40 points or more, but it's been unclear whether his advantage will beget strong turnout. Since last year, Hispanic groups and the Obama campaign separately have worked to reverse a nationwide loss of 2 million registered Latinos and African-Americans following the 2008 elections. The declines concerned many Democratic organizers who believe they have to increase minority turnout from a record 26 percent in 2008 to offset Obama's struggles with white voters. He received 43 percent of white votes in 2008, and that support this year has dropped to as low as 36 percent. The registration efforts targeted swing states such as Colorado, Nevada, North Carolina, Virginia and Florida, where Latino registrations fell by 10 percent \u2014 or more than 140,000 people. \"This is a race of economics, which benefits Romney, versus demographics, which benefit Obama if he can mobilize those groups,\" says Robert Preuhs, a political science professor at Metropolitan State University of Denver. In some of the states that record voters' race and ethnicity, the groundwork appears to have worked. In Florida and North Carolina, for example, the numbers of registered Latinos now have outpaced 2008 levels. The Obama campaign has released figures claiming strong increases in registered Latinos, Democrats and others in several battlegrounds, including Colorado, Florida, Nevada, North Carolina, Ohio and Virginia. The campaign document also said 80 percent of people who have registered since August are minorities, women or younger than 30 \u2014 all groups that form the core of Obama's support. Immigration Differences Widen Gap Latinos' increased engagement in the election seems directly tied to the candidates' divergent positions on immigration. Obama boosted his Latino support with his decision in June to halt deportations of young people who have spent most of their lives in the U.S. Despite the Romney campaign's aggressive Latino outreach and Romney's recent efforts to move toward the center, he hasn't overcome the backlash from his pledge to repeal the Dream Act and his calls for illegal immigrants to \"self-deport.\" Immigration tied with the economy as the top concern for Hispanics in Colorado, Virginia and Arizona, according to recent polls conducted by Latino Decisions. Since Obama's policy announcement in June, the Colorado survey found Latinos' enthusiasm about the election had climbed nine points, to 69 percent. Their support for Obama increased four points, to 74 percent, while support for Romney slid two points, to 20 percent. In Colorado, the candidates are in a near-dead heat in polls. Another new Latino Decisions survey, taken in Virginia, showed Obama had gained seven points and Romney had lost six points since June, at 66 percent to 22 percent, respectively. Polls show Virginia deadlocked. \"Immigration is a personal issue for many of these voters,\" says Michael McDonald, a political science professor at George Mason University in Virginia, who worked on Latino Decisions' survey of that state. \"Without question it raised their willingness to vote for Obama. When Republican candidates can be negatively affected by immigration among Latinos is when they talk about undocumented immigrants ... or like Romney's comments about self-deportation.\" Florida is the outlier, given that immigration is less of a concern to Hispanics there. Registered Latino Democrats only slightly outnumber Republicans. Both factors help explain a new poll showing Obama leading Romney by just six points among Florida Hispanics. Both campaigns have attacked each other over immigration, the economy and other issues in ad wars concentrated in Colorado, Florida and Nevada. The Obama team has spent nearly $9 million and the Romney camp about $4.6 million on Spanish-language television spots in those states, according to the advertising tracker Kantar Media. \"Latinos are already turning out to support President Obama in higher numbers than they did in 2008 because they know that Mitt Romney is on the wrong side of every Latino voter priority and the most extreme presidential nominee on immigration,\" Obama campaign spokeswoman Gabriela Domenzain says. Asked whether Romney's stance on immigration has alienated Latinos, Bettina Inclan, who directs the Romney campaign's Hispanic outreach, declined to respond. Inclan says Hispanics' top concern is the economy, given their nearly 10 percent unemployment rate, compared with 7.8 percent for the nation. \"There's no way you can focus on anything else when you're trying to put food on the table and it's becoming harder and harder to survive,\" Inclan says. \"It's unfortunate that their economic situation continues to get worse and worse under the policies of President Obama.\" Close Races Give Latinos An Opening The upward trends of registration and polling are fanning speculation that if Virginia, Colorado and other battleground states come to a tight finish, even small Latino populations could make a difference. \"Latinos are a sleeping giant in Virginia, and we're waking up,\" says state Delegate Alfonso Lopez, who last year became the first Latino Democrat elected to the Legislature. In North Carolina, for instance, about 105,000 Latinos make up less than 2 percent of registered voters. Obama won by slightly more than 14,000 votes in 2008. Polls show Romney has edged ahead by an average of 5.6 percent. \"Out of 6.2 million voters, that's not very many,\" University of North Carolina professor Ferrel Guillory says of the state's Latinos. \"But if the race is going to come down like it did last time, that may matter. Now, if Obama can get 60 or 70 percent of them, that's a little extra boost.\"",

            "article_content": "President Obama says he hasn't given up on overhauling immigration law despite opposition from Republicans in Congress. Obama faced some tough questions during a forum on Univision including what would be different if he won four more years in the White House.  STEVE INSKEEP, HOST: It's MORNING EDITION from NPR News. I'm Steve Inskeep. RENEE MONTAGNE, HOST: And I'm Renee Montagne. When Mitt Romney appeared on Spanish-language TV this week, he faced a challenge. He won the Republican nomination in part by hammering opponents if they favored opportunities for illegal immigrants. INSKEEP: When President Obama took his turn at Univision, he faced his own challenge. The president was asked why he hasn't solved the problem of so many people here without documents, and why his administration has sent so many home. Here's NPR's Scott Horsley. SCOTT HORSLEY, BYLINE: President Obama faced some tough questions during the Univision forum - about why he'd failed to overhaul immigration law during his first term in office, and what would be different if he won four more years in the White House. Mr. Obama acknowledged the lack of progress on immigration reform is a major failing on his part, but not, he says, for lack of trying. He blames Senate Republicans for blocking even piecemeal efforts to patch the system. (SOUNDBITE OF UNIVISION BROADCAST) HORSLEY: The president was also grilled about the record number of illegal immigrants who were deported on his watch - nearly 400,000 last year.  Mr. Obama says he's tried to focus enforcement resources on undocumented immigrants who commit other crimes but, he insists, he can't just turn a blind eye when immigration laws are broken. (SOUNDBITE OF UNIVISION BROADCAST) HORSLEY: The record pace of deportations, along with the lack of movement on immigration reform, threatened to undermine the strong support Mr. Obama received from Latino voters four years ago. Laura Richardson of Colorado says she was down on Mr. Obama. Not enough to vote Mitt Romney - who's taken a particularly hard line on immigration - but maybe enough to sit this election out. LAURA RICHARDSON: I'm going to be honest. I was a little disappointed because I have a family that is undocumented. But my daughter and my brother convinced me that President Obama is the better option we have right now. They have hope. HORSLEY: Richardson is now aggressively campaigning for Mr. Obama. She was encouraged by his decision this summer to temporarily stop deporting the so-called Dream Act kids who were brought to this country as children. RICHARDSON: I really like what he did for those people. As a mother, I put myself in their position, and I'm sure that they're very happy right now. HORSLEY: Romney has criticized that particular move as a politically-motivated stopgap. The president told Univision one of the lessons he's learned in the last four years - from battles over the payroll tax cut and student loan rates, among others - is that pressure from the public can sometimes move even the most reluctant lawmakers. (SOUNDBITE OF UNIVISION BROADCAST) HORSLEY: And Mr. Obama adds, if a big turnout by Latino voters costs Republicans at the polls this fall, they might change their thinking on immigration, if only because it's in their own political interest.

Obama faced repeated tough questions from the hosts of the forum on the Spanish-language channel, and from some in the audience, for his failure to deliver on his promise as a candidate in 2008 to push comprehensive immigration reform during his first year in the White House. Coming as it did just a day after the Justice Department's watchdog issued a critical report on the agency's now defunct \"Fast and Furious\" program, in which federal agents let guns from the U.S. reach Mexican criminals, Obama was forced to defend Attorney General Eric Holder. But the town hall-style meeting at the University of Miami also gave the president another chance this week to score points at the Republican presidential nominee's expense in the wake of Romney's dismissive comments about nearly half of the electorate. Romney had his chance on Univision the day before. The event also allowed Obama to talk up his move to defer deportations of young people who were brought to the U.S. as small children and are in the country illegally. That action has helped the president solidify his support with many Latino voters. Co-host Jorge Ramos, who has kept after Obama since early in his presidency about the need for presidential leadership on immigration reform, wanted Obama to confess to breaking a vow he made during a May 2008 interview with him. RAMOS: \"At the beginning of your government, you had control of both chambers of Congress, and yet you did not introduce immigration reform. And before I continue, I want for you to acknowledge that you did not keep your promise.\" Obama answered that the campaign promise he made in May 2008 was overtaken by events, namely the economic meltdown and a possible depression. OBAMA: \"I think everybody here remembers where we were four years ago. We lost 800,000 jobs the month that I took office. Small businesses and big businesses couldn't get financing. People had seen their 401(k)s evaporate. People were losing homes left and right. \"And so we had to take a whole series of emergency actions to make sure that we put people back to work \u2014 cutting taxes for middle-class families and small businesses, so that they could stay open or pay the bills; making sure that states got assistance, so they didn't have to lay off teachers and firefighters and police officers; saving an auto industry that was on the brink of collapse. And so \u2014 so that took up a huge amount of time in the first year.\" Obama added that he did try early to find common ground on comprehensive immigration reform with congressional Republicans. But he quickly learned, he said, that even those who had supported such legislation during the George W. Bush administration wouldn't agree to work with him. He promised to make another run at reform if he's re-elected. Asked by someone over Facebook what would make matters any different assuming Republicans held onto the House, Obama said: OBAMA: \"So my hope is that after the election, when the number-one goal is no longer beating me but hopefully the number-one goal is solving the country's problems, if they have seen that people who care about this issue have turned out in strong numbers that they will rethink it, if not because it's the right thing to do, at least because it's in their political interest to do so.\" Under Ramos' prodding, Obama admitted that immigration was his biggest failure. This prompted co-host Maria Elena Salinas to circle back to Ramos' earlier effort to get Obama to admit that he had broken his promise on immigration. SALINAS: (Through interpreter.) \"Yes, as you said, that's your biggest failure. And Jorge asked you if you consider that you broke your promise. So I think that the answer is yes, with many excuses that you actually broke your promise.\" Obama didn't agree or disagree, but said he was \"running for a second term because we've still got more work to do.\" That line drew some of the longest applause of the session from an audience filled with Democrats. Asked by Salinas to address suspicions that his executive action, just months before Election Day, to defer deportation proceedings against young undocumented immigrants was done to get the Hispanic vote, Obama said: OBAMA: \"Well, I \u2014 I think if you take a look at the polls, I was winning the Latino vote before we took that action, partly because the other side had completely abandoned their commitment to things like comprehensive immigration reform.\" With the fallout still hanging in the air from Romney's comments at a May fundraiser, Ramos asked Obama if he thought the Republican candidate who made the \"47 percent\" comment \u2014 or the one who said Wednesday on Univision that his campaign is about the \"100 percent\" \u2014 is the \"true Romney?\" OBAMA: \"You know, I think your question, Jorge, about what's the real Mitt Romney is better directed at Mr. Romney. But I will say this: You know, when you \u2014 when you express an attitude that half the country consider itself victims, that somehow they want to be dependent on government, my thinking is maybe you haven't gotten around a lot, because I travel around the country all the time, and \u2014 and the American people are the hardest-working people there are. And their problem is not \u2014 (applause) \u2014 their problem is not that they're not working hard enough or they don't want to work or they're being taxed too little or they just want to loaf around and \u2014 and gather government checks.\" Obama also offered a variation of a line he used earlier in the week on the Late Show with David Letterman. OBAMA: \"I've been president now for almost four years. But the day I was elected, that night in Grant Park, where I spoke to the country, I said 47 percent of the people didn't vote for me, but I've heard your voices, and I'm going to work just as hard for you as I did for those who did vote for me. That's how you have to operate as a president. I \u2014 I truly believe that.\" When the discussion turned to Fast and Furious, Ramos asked the president if Attorney General Holder shouldn't be fired even if he didn't know about the program. Guns from the program were found at the scene of a murdered U.S. Border Patrol agent in 2010. OBAMA: \"I will tell you that Eric Holder has my complete confidence because he has shown himself to be willing to hold accountable those who took these actions and is passionate about making sure that we're preventing guns from getting into the wrong hands.\"",

            "article_content": "Mitt Romney said on Univision that his campaign is about \"the 100 percent\" after he was asked about his \"47 percent\" comment.\n                \n                    \n                    Charles Dharapak/AP\n                    \n                \nhide caption Mitt Romney said on Univision that his campaign is about \"the 100 percent\" after he was asked about his \"47 percent\" comment. Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney had to deal with at least three challenges Wednesday at a meet-the-presidential-candidate forum on Spanish-language Univision. One was to try to further defuse controversial comments that recently came to light in which he described, at a private fundraiser in May, President Obama's supporters as dependent on the federal government. Another was to explain why Latinos should support a candidate who has proposed that undocumented immigrants voluntarily leave the U.S., and who expressed his support for Arizona's hard-line immigration law. The third was to answer the question why Latinos shouldn't support President Obama who, after all, used his executive power to implement parts of the long-stalled DREAM Act in order to help young immigrants brought illegally into the U.S. as children. If Romney was daunted by any of this, he showed no signs of it during the 45-minute session in front of a friendly Republican audience at the University of Miami. (Obama was scheduled to appear Thursday at the same forum before an audience of Democrats.) Right off the bat, Romney was asked by host Maria Elena Salinas about his remarks about the \"47 percent\" of voters who support Obama. Romney's answer showed that his approach to the uproar, which erupted Monday with the publication of the video by Mother Jones, continues to evolve. Instead of saying he was merely talking about campaign strategy and acknowledging the political reality that voters are about evenly split between him and the president, he said: \"First of all, this is a campaign about the 100 percent. And in the last several years you've seen greater divisiveness in this country. We had hoped to come back together but instead you've seen us pull apart. And politics has driven us apart in some respects. So my campaign is about the 100 percent of America. And I'm concerned about them ... \" The questions quickly turned to immigration, with Salinas asking Romney if he would maintain Obama's deferred-action policy, which would stop deportation proceedings against certain young people brought into the country illegally by parents or others. Romney repeated his past criticism that Obama's action was temporary and that a President Romney would push for comprehensive and permanent immigration reform. With Romney failing to directly answer the question, Salinas finally said: \"Are you going to deport them or not? Yes or no?\" Romney answered: \"We're not going to round up people around the country and deport them ... \" That led host Jorge Ramos to remind Romney that the former Massachusetts governor had called on illegal immigrants to deport themselves. Ramos asked if 11 million people would self-deport. And, he added, did Romney like the tough Arizona law that cracks down on illegal immigrants? \"I believe people make their own choices as to whether they want to go home. And that's what I mean by self-deportation,\" Romney said. The candidate added that a provision in the controversial Arizona law that he likes requires employers to check the immigration status of job applicants. In keeping with a campaign strategy that one of the best ways to win the White House is to remind Obama's supporters of their disappointments with the president, Romney repeated an argument on immigration he's used before: \"What the president did was take no action when he had a Democrat House and Senate, even though he said he would. And then he put in place something he called a stopgap measure \u2014 temporary. These kids deserve something better than temporary. They deserve a permanent solution ... \" The president's deputy campaign manager, Stephanie Cutter, issued Team Obama's response to Romney's appearance: \"Tonight, Mitt Romney continued to demonstrate why Hispanic Americans don't trust him. Whether it's raising taxes on the middle class to pay for another millionaire tax cut, repealing Obamacare and leaving as many as 9 million Hispanic Americans without health insurance or doubling down on asking immigrants to self-deport, Mitt Romney is wrong on issues of importance to the Hispanic community. On critical issues, he continued to refuse to answer any of the tough questions or provide any specifics on what he'd do as president. We are just two weeks away from the first presidential debate, where the American people will demand more than vague answers and empty platitudes. It's time for Mitt Romney to come clean and get specific about his policies.\"",

            "article_content": "Hispanics were a major focus of the program at the Republican National Convention in Tampa. Democrats, beginning their convention in Charlotte, N.C., are hoping to capitalize on their current advantage with Hispanic voters.  ROBERT SIEGEL, HOST: The Democratic National Convention got under way today in Charlotte, North Carolina. Beyond formally nominating President Obama and Vice President Biden for second terms, the event will also showcase the party's rising Latino political leaders. Democrats hold a sizable edge over Republicans among Hispanic voters. And they are determined to further cement that advantage at this week's convention. NPR's David Welna reports from Charlotte. DAVID WELNA, BYLINE: The Democratic convention will make history this evening when Julian Castro, the 37-year-old mayor of San Antonio, Texas, steps up to the podium as the first Latino to be keynote speaker at a national political convention. He'll be introduced by his identical twin brother, Joaquin, who's currently running for a seat in Congress. For Elizabeth Mendoza, a 26-year-old convention delegate from Washington state, their appearance in such a privilege speaking slot means Latinos in this country have arrived. ELIZABETH MENDOZA: As a young Latino voter, it just says, you know, that they are not only talking the talk, but they're walking the walk. We're not only visibly at the convention, but there's 800 of us delegates this time around. And that really shows, I mean, strength in numbers. WELNA: You might think the prospect of taking the center of the political stage would make a relative unknown nervous. But if that's the case with Julian Castro, he's not letting on. MAYOR JULIAN CASTRO: I don't feel much pressure on me. The key is not so much the personalities. The key is the policies. WELNA: Speaking with NPR in the stands above the stage he'll take later tonight, Castro says those policies have been good for this nation's nearly 50 million Latinos. CASTRO: The reason that the president is winning 70 to 25 with Latino voters is that, you know, he's made more educational opportunities possible. A hundred and fifty thousand more Latinos are getting Pell Grants now under his leadership. WELNA: Another Latino politician playing a leading role here is Los Angeles Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa, who's chairing the convention. MAYOR ANTONIO VILLARAIGOSA: We have a platform that calls for comprehensive immigration reform that will support the DREAM Act. These are our values, and I think you'll see a reflection of that. WELNA: You'll also likely to hear some Democratic broadsides against the GOP's efforts in Tampa last week to woo Latino voters where several Hispanic Republicans got prominent speaking slots. Congresswoman Debbie Wasserman Schultz chairs the Democratic National Committee. REPRESENTATIVE DEBBIE WASSERMAN SCHULTZ: You know, the Republicans have done everything they can to send a message to Hispanics that you aren't welcome here, that your priorities don't matter. And that Mitt Romney has repeatedly said that what we need to do when it comes to immigration policy is tell the 12 million undocumented immigrants that are here that they should just self-deport. WELNA: The fight over the Latino vote is growing fiercer between Democrats and Republicans. Kenneth Fernandez directs the Elon University Poll. He says demographics are driving that dispute. KENNETH FERNANDEZ: And if you look at the United States and what is driving the growth across the United States, it is both immigration and Latino birthrate. So this is the sleeping giant that people have been talking about, well, ever since I've been studying the issue for, what we're talking about, several decades. WELNA: Which is why Democrats are looking to Latinos to help them carry such battleground states as Nevada, Colorado and Florida. Convention delegates Lorena Gonzalez, of Washington state says the biggest challenge is to get eligible Hispanics registered to vote. LORENA GONZALEZ: I think the reality is, is that when Latinos vote, they vote Democratic. And so getting them registered to vote is really important. It's a really important effort because once they get registered to vote, the chances of them voting for President Barack Obama or other future Democratic presidential candidates is tremendous. It's huge. WELNA: And this year's Democratic convention, Gonzales says, should convince Latinos that President Obama's party is truly on their side. David Welna, NPR News, Charlotte.

Michelle Obama Steals The Show: There is no doubt that this night belonged to first lady Michelle Obama, who delivered a sweeping, personal and dramatic endorsement of her husband, President Obama. It was a speech that built on the themes Julian Castro laid out earlier in the night. It was a speech that talked about the American dream and American exceptionalism. It was a speech that posited that an American president needs to have the solid values of family and hard work in order to have the empathy necessary to govern in a way that makes the American dream achievable for everyone. It was a speech that highlighted the deep differences in life experience between the two candidates, yet Obama never mentioned Mitt Romney by name. \"Barack knows the American Dream because he's lived it,\" she said. \"And he wants everyone in this country to have that same opportunity, no matter who we are, or where we're from, or what we look like, or who we love. \"And he believes that when you've worked hard, and done well, and walked through that doorway of opportunity ... you do not slam it shut behind you ... you reach back, and you give other folks the same chances that helped you succeed. \"So when people ask me whether being in the White House has changed my husband, I can honestly say that when it comes to his character, and his convictions, and his heart, Barack Obama is still the same man I fell in love with all those years ago.\" That the night belonged to Michelle Obama was clear as soon as she took the stage. The first lady is the rock star of the party; it was evident by the number of flashes that overtook the arena when she walked in. By the time she was winding down, the crowd had reached such a roar that her final line \u2014 the one in which she asked the country to give their trust to her husband \u2014 was hardly audible. Update at 10:27 p.m. ET. First Latino Keynote: It was a momentous occasion for Julian Castro tonight. With his speech, he became the first Latino to deliver the keynote address at a Democratic National Convention. He introduced himself to the nation as a product of the American dream: His grandmother, he said, didn't make it past fourth grade. She never owned a home. But Castro's mother was the first to graduate from college. And, now, here he is at the stage of the Democratic National Convention. Romney, he said, just doesn't get that trajectory. \"Mitt Romney, quite simply, doesn't get it,\" he said. \"A few months ago he visited a university in Ohio and gave the students there a little entrepreneurial advice. 'Start a business,' he said. But how? 'Borrow money if you have to from your parents,' he told them. Gee, why didn't I think of that?\" he finished to a great round of laughs from the crowd. But Castro also worked the \"hope and change\" angle. \"The dream of raising a family in a place where hard work is rewarded is not unique to Americans,\" he said. \"It's a human dream, one that calls across oceans and borders. The dream is universal, but America makes it possible. And our investment in opportunity makes it a reality.\" President Obama, he said, can help Americans attain that dream. He said: \"Four years ago, America stood on the brink of a depression. Despite incredible odds and united Republican opposition, our president took action, and now we've seen 4.5 million new jobs. He knows better than anyone that there's more hard work to do, but we're making progress. And now we need to make a choice. \"It's a choice between a country where the middle class pays more so that millionaires can pay less \u2014 or a country where everybody pays their fair share, so we can reduce the deficit and create the jobs of the future. It's a choice between a nation that slashes funding for our schools and guts Pell grants \u2014 or a nation that invests more in education. It's a choice between a politician who rewards companies that ship American jobs overseas \u2014 or a leader who brings jobs back home.\" Update at 10:03 p.m. ET. A Defense Of Obama: If Ted Strickland delivered the strongest attack on Mitt Romney, Gov. Deval Patrick delivered the best defense of Barack Obama. \"If we want to win elections in November and keep our country moving forward, if we want to earn the privilege to lead, it's time for Democrats to stiffen our backbone and stand up for what we believe,\" he said. He added: \"This is the president who delivered the security of affordable health care to every single American after 90 years of trying. This is the president who brought Osama bin Laden to justice, who ended the war in Iraq and is ending the war in Afghanistan. This is the president who ended 'don't ask, don't tell' so that love of country, not love of another, determines fitness for military service. Who made equal pay for equal work the law of the land. This is the president who saved the American auto industry from extinction, the American financial industry from self-destruction, and the American economy from depression. Who added over 4.5 million private sector jobs in the last two-plus years, more jobs than George W. Bush added in eight. \"The list of accomplishments is long, impressive and barely told \u2014 even more so when you consider that congressional Republicans have made obstruction itself the centerpiece of their governing strategy. With a record and a vision like that, I will not stand by and let him be bullied out of office \u2014 and neither should you, and neither should you and neither should you.\" Update at 9:46 p.m. ET. What Women Lose Can't Be Measured In Dollars: Liz sends us this report about Lilly Ledbetter's speech: She became the symbol of gender-based workplace inequity when her pay discrimination case against Goodyear was dismissed by the U.S. Supreme Court because she didn't file her claim within 180 days of the alleged discrimination. Since then, Ledbetter's name has become the rallying cry for gender pay equity, and she inspired the post-court legislation named for her. In 2009, the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act was the first bill Obama signed as president. Ledbetter, who also spoke at the 2008 Democratic convention in Denver, received a thunderous welcome. \"Some of you may know my story,\" she said. \"How for 19 years I worked as a manager for a tire plant in Alabama. And some of you may have lived a similar story: After nearly two decades of hard, proud work, I found out that I was making significantly less money than the men who were doing the same work as me. I went home, talked to my husband, and we decided to fight.\" Ledbetter, a mother and grandmother, recounted her decade-long fight for \"equal pay for equal work,\" ending at the high court, which rejected her claim in a 5-4 decision. Here's an excerpt from her speech: \"And that would have been the end of the story. But with President Obama on our side, even though I lost before the Supreme Court, we won. The first bill that President Obama signed into law was the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act. I think it says something about his priorities that the first bill he put his name on has my name on it too. \"As he said that day with me by his side, 'Making our economy work means making sure it works for everyone.' \"The president signed the bill for his grandmother, whose dreams hit the glass ceiling, And for his daughters, so that theirs never will. Because of his leadership, women who faced pay discrimination like I did will now get their day in court. \"That was the first step but it can't be the last. Because women still earn just 77 cents for every dollar men make. Those pennies add up to real money. It's real money for the little things like being able to take your kids to the movies and for the big things like sending them to college. It's paying your rent this month and paying the mortgage in the future. It's having savings for the bill you didn't expect and savings for the dignified retirement you've earned.\" She also took a broad swipe at Romney, who has not said whether as president he'd support the Ledbetter legislation. \"Maybe 23 cents doesn't sound like a lot to someone with a Swiss bank account, Cayman Island Investments and an IRA worth tens of millions of dollars,\" she said. \"But Governor Romney, when we lose 23 cents every hour, every day, every paycheck, every job, over our entire lives, what we lose can't just be measured in dollars.\" The cause that bears her name, she said, \"is bigger than me. It's as big as all of you.\" Update at 9:19 p.m. ET. An Indictment Of Romney: We've heard quite a bit on why Democrats believe Romney is bad for the country. But no one has delivered such a strong indictment as Ted Strickland, the former governor of Ohio. He delivered line after line of pointed attacks and he worked to a culmination in which he laid out what makes these two presidential candidates different. He said: \"Mitt Romney has so little economic patriotism that even his money needs a passport. It summers on the beaches of the Cayman Islands and winters on the slopes of the Swiss Alps. In Matthew, chapter 6, verse 21, the scriptures teach us that where your treasure is, there will your heart be also. My friends, any man who aspires to be our president should keep both his treasure and his heart in the United States of America. And it's well past time for Mitt Romney to come clean with the American people. \"On what he's saying about the president's policy for welfare to work, he's lying. Simple as that. On his tax returns, he's hiding. You have to wonder, just what is so embarrassing that he's gone to such great lengths to bury the truth? Whatever he's doing to avoid taxes, can it possibly be worse than the Romney-Ryan tax plan that would have sliced Mitt's total tax rate to less than one percent? \"My friends, there is a true choice in this election. Barack Obama is betting on the American worker. Mitt Romney is betting on a Bermuda shell corporation. Barack Obama saved the American auto industry. Mitt Romney saved on his taxes. Barack Obama is an economic patriot. Mitt Romney is an outsourcing pioneer. My friends, the stakes are too high, the differences too stark to sit this one out. Let us stand as one on November 6th and move this country forward by re-electing President Barack Obama.\" Update at 9:00 p.m. ET. An Emotional Defense Of Health Care: In perhaps the most emotional moment of the night, Stacey Lihn, a mother from Arizona, stood onstage flanked by her husband and her two kids. Zoe Madison, the youngest one, was born with a congenital heart defect. Lihn said that Obama's Affordable Care Act gave her security. On the day the Supreme Court handed down its decision upholding the law, she also got a call from her health insurance, saying the lifetime cap on what the insurance company would pay for had been lifted because of the new law. She says she is terrified that Mitt Romney will repeal the law and Zoe won't get the care and surgery she needs to survive. \"One in 100 children are born with a congenital heart defect,\" she said. \"President Obama is fighting for them.\" The crowd erupted into applause and for the first time tonight they chanted, \"Four more years! Four more years.\" One thing that's clear is that Democrats are embracing Obamacare. As Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius put it following Lihn, \"For Democrats Obamacare is a badge of honor.\" Update at 8:11 p.m. ET. Outside The Arena, An Act Of Civil Disobedience: Yesterday, we wrote about a group of undocumented immigrants who rode cross-country on a 1970s tour bus, flaunting their illegal status. We just got word that outside the Time Warner Cable Arena, 10 of them were arrested. According to the group, 10 of them hung a sign that read, \"No papers, no fear,\" near the security checkpoint. An arrest for an illegal immigrant is serious, because of the risk of deportation. \"We came out because we are tired of the mistreatment,\" the group said in a statement emailed to reporters. \"We are tired of waiting for change and we know that it never comes without risk or without sacrifice.\" Update at 7:56 p.m. ET. A Tribute To Ted Kennedy, An Attack On Romney: In a video tribute to Ted Kennedy, who died in 2009, one of the prominent elements showcased was his 1994 Senate race against Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney. The Obama campaign used the opportunity to showcase how Romney has changed his position on issues like abortion. It also allowed the campaign to showcase Kennedy's swift swipes at Romney during a debate. Liz, who was on the floor during the video, tells us the crowd roared when the video showed Kennedy saying if given enough time Romney is such a flip-flopper that he \"may even vote for me.\" \"They loved this. They're on their feet, some are chanting 'Teddy.' This is getting reaction prime-time speakers would die for,\" Liz tells us. If you're interested, here are some of the cuts from that 1994 debate, and here is the tribute video itself. Reince Priebus, the chair of the Republican National Committee quickly criticized the tribute on Twitter. \"Classless Dems use tribute video of deceased Ted Kennedy to attack Mitt Romney,\" Priebus tweeted. But Liz tells us the delegates on the floor disagree. \"I thought it was fantastic \u2014 a way to show what the party has always been about,\" said Michael Crossey, a Pennsylvania delegate and president of the State Education Association. As for the Romney footage? \"They're Mr. Romney's words. They're showing Mr. Romney for who he has always been: a flip-flopper.\" Gail Sias, a bank teller and pharmacy worker from Mississippi, took a more serious approach to the Kennedy tribute. \"If you've ever been sitting at that kitchen table, working every day with no health insurance, you're just praying and hoping nothing happens to you and your children,\" she said. \"The 'what ifs?' \u2014 that's real life. Thats why the Kennedy family is so precious \u2014 they understood the 'what if' question.\" Update at 7:39 p.m. ET. The Case For Pragmatism: We're going to step back a bit to note that Cory Booker, the mayor of Newark, N.J., has gotten one of the most robust responses from the crowd. His speech was a lot about the need for pragmatism instead of ideology. \"Our platform, crafted by Democrats, is not about partisanship but pragmatism; not about left or right, but about moving America and our economy forward,\" Booker started. Then he went on to defend the Democratic platform and draw a disntinction between parties. He said: \"Our platform and our president are not interested in petty political arguments. Instead, this platform of big and practical ideas sets forth an emboldened pathway toward the historic hope which has driven generations of Americans forward \u2014 it is our most fundamental national aspiration \u2014 that no matter who you are, no matter what your color, creed, how you choose to pray or who you choose to love, that if you are an American \u2014 first generation or fifth \u2014 one who is willing to work hard, play by the rules and apply your God-given talents \u2014 that you should be able to find a job that pays the bills. \"You should be able to afford health care for your family. You should be able to retire with dignity and respect. \"And you should be able to give your children the kind of education that allows them to dream even bigger, go even farther and accomplish even more than you could ever imagine. \"This is our platform. This is our American mission.\" Update at 7:27 p.m. ET. The Women Of The House: One of the themes we're likely to keep hearing during this convention is that the Democratic Party is the party for women. That point is being made dramatically at the moment: Twenty-five female members of the House are onstage, all of them dressed in bright primary colors. House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi kicked it off, and then a parade of women reminded the audience of what they said was a Republican war on women. Update at 7:06 p.m. ET. A Point-By-Point Defense: NPR's Liz Halloran sends this report: \"Former Virginia Gov. Tim Kaine, who is locked in a dead-heat Senate battle with former GOP Gov. George Allen, used his speech to give a point-by-point argument for Obama's promises fulfilled. \"Ended war in Iraq. Took out Osama bin Laden. Reformed health care. Fought for equal pay for women, fair treatment for LGBT Americans. \"And, with a nod toward his constituents, Kaine noted that Obama's drawdown of troops in Afghanistan has meant that 'every single Virginia National Guard is home for the first time in a decade.' \" 'And we're so happy,' he said.\" Real Clear Politics has the latest polling in the race. It has Kaine leading by 0.6 percentage point. Update at 6:53 p.m. ET. 'Fired Up, Ready To Go': Throughout this campaign, there's been a lot of talk about whether President Obama would be able to rekindle the kind of fervor he sparked in 2008. As Ron put it earlier, that's one of the big questions during this convention. Before the proceedings started, I took a trip down to the convention floor. It was a raucous scene with the Louisiana delegation's members leading the way. They were loud and musical, and then suddenly, after a tweaked rendition of \"When The Saints Go Marching In,\" they segued into a familiar call and response. \"Fired up!\" one side chanted. \"Ready to go!\" the other side responded. Like \"Yes, we can,\" that call and response was widely used by the Obama campaign in 2008. \"The spirit is high; the energy is high,\" said Jennifer Vidrine, a Louisiana delegate and the mayor of Ville Platte. She said times were tough right now but they were celebrating because President Obama had led the the country out of \"such a big ditch.\" \"We're adding jobs,\" she said. \"Maybe not at the pace we would like, but it's growing.\" I found Donald Hughes, a North Carolina delegate, dancing on the side of the stage. He's 24 and sharply dressed: a black suit, cropped trousers accentuated by black-and-white sneakers. This is his second convention. His first was in 2008 in Denver, when Obama accepted his party's nomination buoyed by an outpouring of youthful enthusiasm. Hughes said that in 2008, Obama was seen as the first president for a new generation. That hasn't changed, said Hughes. The president declared his support for gay marriage and he issued an executive order to halt the deportation of young undocumented immigrants, he said. \"All of that proves that he is courageous and bold even in situations that are politically risky,\" Hughes said. Update at 5:31 p.m. ET. The Schedule For Tonight: Of course, tonight's featured stars are first lady Michelle Obama and the keynote speaker, San Antonio Mayor Julian Castro. Just so you have an idea of how the night will unfold, here's a quick rundown of the notables scheduled to speak tonight. At the 9 p.m. ET hour: -- Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius -- Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel -- Of Harold & Kumar fame, actor Kal Penn -- Fair pay activist Lilly Ledbetter -- Maryland Gov. Martin O'Malley At the 10 p.m. prime-time hour: -- San Antonio Mayor Julian Castro -- First lady Michelle Obama",

Partly because it's a hulking 1970s tour bus that somehow made it from Arizona all the way to Charlotte, but mostly because of what's inscribed on the side of it in thick, black letters. \"Sin Papeles, Sin Miedo,\" it reads in Spanish. \"No papers, no fear.\" Carrying a bunch of undocumented activists, the bus rolled through the country, through states like Arizona, Texas, Louisiana and Georgia, and into Charlotte on the eve of the Democratic National Convention. The activists participated in a march that snaked through Charlotte on Sunday, and by Monday, they had moved to a church that was hosting them about eight miles from the city. That's where I met 21-year-old Fernando L\u00f3pez. He came to the country illegally when he was in his teens. He came to the U.S. to reunite with his brother, whom he had not seen in 10 years. But then he was stopped for a traffic violation in Arizona, and ended up in jail and with deportation orders. \"This bus,\" he said, \"is just a bit of civil disobedience.\" It's a bold statement for sure. The \"no papers, no fear\" refrain emerged from the activists fighting the stringent anti-immigration laws that were first passed in Arizona. If you remember, it was in June of last year that Jose Antonio Vargas, a prominent journalist, came out as an illegal immigrant in a splashy New York Times Magazine piece. That propelled a generation of young immigrants who were educated in the United States to declare publicly that they were in the country illegally. It put pressure on the White House, and earlier this summer, Obama announced that he was ordering a stop to the deportation of some young immigrants. This bus tour \u2014 called the Undocu-Bus \u2014 is a kind of culmination of the movement. \"We have been traveling like this for over a month, and we have gotten a lot of attention, and I think we're showing that we have no fear,\" he said. \"As one writer said, 'When we lose fear, they lose their power.' They can't really intimidate us anymore.\" L\u00f3pez walks into the bus. It's incredibly hot. Within minutes, there's sweat running down his forehead. He walks through it showing it off like a proud parent. \"Priscila\" is her name, he says. There are four small couches, and toward the back there's a fridge that doesn't work and a stove that doesn't work. L\u00f3pez says the six-week cross-country trek has been uncomfortable at times, but it's doing its job, bringing attention to an issue that he says comes up every election cycle, but never gets addressed. \"Were not here to beg or to ask, like we have been doing for many years, for immigration reform,\" he said. \"We're here to put an option to President Obama on the table, which is to be on the right side of history.\" Maria Cruz Ram\u00edrez, 46, rode on the Undo-bus for six weeks.\n                \n                    \n                    Eyder Peralta/NPR\n                    \n                \nhide caption Maria Cruz Ram\u00edrez, 46, rode on the Undo-bus for six weeks. Maria Cruz Ram\u00edrez, 46, was also on the bus. She said that in the past, she would reveal her legal status quietly. But increasingly, aggressive laws in different states, she said, have made her more vocal. She has three kids \u2014 two of them college-age, all of them undocumented. She says along the way, she's learned a lot about organizing and mobilizing a community. She said they met with some black civil rights leaders, and in some ways that helps explains the new, uncompromising message they're sending with this bus tour. Ram\u00edrez certainly uses the arguments that immigration reform proponents have used for years. She says that immigrants come to the United States to work, and all she wants is a \"dignified existence.\" But when I ask her if she's not afraid that by riding on that bus she might end up deported to her native Mexico, she gives a firm response. \"No,\" she said. \"I'm not scared, because this is a question of human rights.\" She points to the bus. Along with the refrain, the group painted monarch butterflies. Like many of the people in the group, Ram\u00edrez is also wearing a monarch butterfly pin. The butterflies have become their symbol, because every year they trek from the United States to Mexico, unimpeded by borders or policy.",

            "article_content": "Potential applicants line up for counseling sessions on President Obama's \"deferred action\" program at St. Mary's Church in New York.\n                \n                    \n                    Joel Rose/NPR\n                    \n                \nhide caption The U.S. government began accepting applications for \"deferred action for childhood arrivals\" Wednesday \u2014 a program designed to allow qualified young people to study and work in the U.S. openly. On New York's Lower East Side, a line stretched around the block. Hundreds of potential applicants had shown up for free legal advice. Inside the church basement, dozens waited for help filling out their paperwork. Millions Expected To Apply \"Half of me is saying, 'OK, it's real,' \" says Mubashar Ahmed, a college student studying chemical engineering. \"The other one's asking, 'Is it real?' Now seeing it is actually believing it. Like, looking at all these people signed up to do it, I'm like, OK, this works.\" Ahmed, 26, hopes deferred action will give him a chance at continuing his studies in the U.S., and at ultimately getting a job in his field. Potential applicants for President Obama's deferred action program gather at St. Mary's Church in New York for a workshop and legal advice.\n                \n                    \n                    Joel Rose/NPR\n                    \n                \nhide caption Potential applicants for President Obama's deferred action program gather at St. Mary's Church in New York for a workshop and legal advice. \"For the first time, I know that I can do this over here, without having to give up on everything that I've worked on and all the people that supported me.\" Ahmed is one of an estimated 110,000 potential deferred action applicants in New York state alone. Nationwide, more than 1.7 million people could sign up for deferred action. What they're applying for is not permanent legal status \u2014 something advocates of the DREAM Act, which failed in Congress earlier this year, had been pushing for. Instead, applicants will essentially receive a promise from the federal government that they won't be deported for the next two years. During that time, they can study and work legally. At a press conference Wednesday, local lawmakers, including New York City Council speaker Christine Quinn, urged Congress and the president to do more. \"This is a great day,\" Quinn said. \"It's a great step forward. But it is not enough. We want to make the DREAM Act no longer the DREAM Act \u2014 that it is the law.\" In the meantime, Quinn urged New Yorkers who are eligible to sign up for deferred action. Still, despite the lines in the Lower East Side today, not everyone is rushing to apply. Not Without Risk \"There's obviously huge fear,\" says Muzaffar Chishti, director of the New York office of the nonpartisan Migration Policy Institute. Chishti says many potential applicants are worried about coming out of the shadows \u2014 because anyone who applies for deferred action but gets rejected will have told the government a great deal about themselves. \"So it's a big risk,\" Chishti says. \"And since there's no guarantee in this program that just because you apply that you will get the benefit, it's a cost-benefit analysis, which every individual will have to frankly make themselves.\" Those risks may be most serious for people who've had a brush with the law. The Obama administration was careful to limit the deferred action program to those with no felonies or serious misdemeanors on their records. But that has not been enough to placate the administration's critics. Roy Beck, president of NumbersUSA, a nonprofit that advocates for lower immigration levels, says the program puts Americans at a disadvantage. \"Unemployed Americans are now going to have about maybe 1.8 million more people added into the legal workforce, to compete with them for a limited number of jobs,\" Beck says. \"So there's a cost to this. And the cost is to the most vulnerable young Americans.\" A Program With An Uncertain Future Critics also accuse the Obama administration of circumventing the will of Congress to change the country's immigration policy \u2014 and pandering to Latino voters in an election year. It's not clear what would happen to the deferred action program if Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney is elected in the fall. That worries many potential applicants, including Nathalia Narciso of New York. Even so, she's planning to sign up for deferred action. \"When people ask me about this, I always let them know, 'Just remember that they could take this away at any moment,' \" Narciso says. \"I'm worried, but at the same time, it's a risk that we've got to take. And I'm willing to take it.\" Judging by the lines for legal help at St. Mary's Church, a lot of potential applicants may come to the same conclusion.",

Today, they belong to a Spanish-speaking Mormon congregation and speak Spanish at home with their two daughters, Isabella and Amaya. Mitt Romney is the most famous Mormon running for office this fall. But he's far from the only one. In Arizona, two other members of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints \u2014 Rep. Jeff Flake and businessman Wil Cardon \u2014 are vying for the Republican nomination for the U.S. Senate. All three candidates have said they'll be tough on immigration. And while Mormons in Arizona have been closely identified with conservative politics, the immigration debate has exposed a rare divide on the issue. Shared Faith, Different Political Views The original sponsor of the state's tough immigration law, former state Senate President Russell Pearce, is Mormon, too. But it was also Mormon voters who helped oust Pearce in a historic recall election. Among them is Daryl Williams, a Phoenix attorney who is also a senior member of the church in Maricopa County. He found himself drawn into the immigration debate around the time SB 1070 became law. \"I had been solicited by several to join the Minutemen ... sort of be your own posse to protect the border,\" says Williams, who adds that he disagreed with their views on immigration. \"I didn't see there was a problem with the border, and that solicitation to be a Minuteman by some people in my family, by the way, induced me to prepare and do research on an essay, which I wrote on immigration. And I thought it was just inconsistent with what was good for the state economically and certainly inconsistent with the principles of the Mormon faith.\" Daryl Williams is an attorney and a senior figure in the Mormon church in the Phoenix area. His discomfort with Arizona's immigration law led him to take up the issue at town hall events across the state.\n                \n                    \n                    Andrea Hsu/NPR\n                    \n                \nhide caption Daryl Williams is an attorney and a senior figure in the Mormon church in the Phoenix area. His discomfort with Arizona's immigration law led him to take up the issue at town hall events across the state. Williams presented his essay at town forums across Arizona. The church took notice, and at one point a church official raised concerns about his activism. But then something happened in neighboring Utah that affected the debate in Arizona. The Mormon church, which usually does not endorse political parties or stances, backed the so-called Utah Compact, a pact among business leaders, politicians and others that encouraged a more welcoming approach on immigration. \"It is very significant that they weighed in,\" Williams says. \"It is not a casual event.\" When Utah passed several pieces of legislation seen as moderate on immigration, Williams says, church officials were present for the bill-signing. \"That caused a real furor among many members of the church who thought that that was an abandonment of the belief to obey, honor and sustain the law,\" says Williams. \"Well, the church's policy as I see it is not to obey, honor and sustain just any law, but to obey, honor and sustain good laws.\" Bilingual Families Of Faith The debate is also being influenced by the reality of changing demographics. In a modest home just north of Phoenix, Evelyn Oyuki Morgan says a prayer in Spanish, asking God to bless her family members wherever they may be \u2014 and then it's time for enchiladas Her husband, Paul, was raised in Arizona. He met Oyuki more than a decade ago while he was on his two-year mission to Mexico's Yucatan Peninsula. She was already a member of the church in her grandparents' tiny truck stop of a town. \"I was at church and saw her,\" he says. \"And the bad thing was I still had a really long time left to finish my two-year mission. And so I told the mission president, 'I think it would be good if you ship me far away.' \" So they did. \"And when I got done,\" he says, \"I called her up. 'Remember me?' She remembered me. That was good.\" They dated long distance and then decided to get married. Getting Oyuki a fiancee visa took a year \u2014 and many documents, fingerprints, even blood work, not to mention money. She's now a permanent resident. Paul Morgan comes from a very conservative family, and he says marrying into another culture was a bit of shock. \"My entire life I had dated blondes,\" he says. \"And I always had said I was going to marry a blonde. At no point did I ever think I'd marry a Latina, did I ever think that my two little daughters would be speaking Spanish to me.\" Nor did he think he'd end up belonging to a Spanish-speaking congregation, worshipping alongside undocumented immigrants. \"A lot of the people that we go to church with don't have papers,\" he says, \"and a lot of them to be able to work will use stolen Social Security cards or borrowed Social Security cards.\" While Morgan calls President Obama's decision to defer deportations for young undocumented immigrants \"a breath of fresh air,\" he is also excited to see Romney running for president. So how will he vote in November? \"You're asking a guy who grew up in the Mormon church who he's going to vote for, [and] for the first time ever, a Mormon's right at the forefront of actually becoming president. ... Like I said, I hate politics.\" But if all politics is personal, it's Paul Morgan, Daryl Williams and many other Mormons who have very much affected the tenor of immigration debate in Arizona.",

Rodriguez moved to the U.S. with his mother when he was a child, and is undocumented. \"The best thing I can do now,\" he says, \"is organize those that can [vote], and make them vote for me.\"\n                \n                    \n                    Andrea Hsu/NPR\n                    \n                \nhide caption For years, Maricopa County, Ariz., has been ground zero in the debate over immigration. On one hand, the massive county, which includes the state capital of Phoenix, has a growing Latino population. On the other, it's home to publicity savvy Sheriff Joe Arpaio, who has made his name by strictly enforcing, some say overstepping, immigration laws. Last month, the Supreme Court struck down much of the state's immigration enforcement law known as SB 1070, even while leaving intact its most controversial provision. That allows Arizona police to question the immigration status of suspects they've stopped or arrested. In the aftermath of the high court decision, Latino immigration activists are as busy as ever trying to transform the fear and frustration of Latino families into actual voting power. 'We Are America' On a recent evening, more than 100 people filled the cafeteria of Carl Hayden Community High School in Phoenix for a forum on SB 1070. It was organized by the group Somos America \u2014 \"We Are America\" \u2014 and aimed at undocumented people. Audience members dashed off questions on white note cards for a panel that included immigration attorneys and a representative from the Mexican Consulate. Among the questions: \"If I'm detained in my car and I don't have a driver's license, what can I show?\" Another asked: \"If I go walking, can a policeman stop me and ask me for my immigration status?\" The question-and-answer period went on for more than an hour; no one left the room. At the end of the evening, Somos America President Daniel Rodriguez took to the podium. \"Raise your hand,\" he said in Spanish, \"if you know someone who's not here but needs this information. Raise your hand if you know someone who's been deported. Raise your hand if you know someone who has the power to vote.\" Across the room, hands shot up at each statement. \"Every question, almost everyone raised their hands, and that just goes to show you that there's a lot of people that know the pain and the hurt of being deported or having to know someone that was deported,\" Rodriguez recounted. Rodriguez told the crowd of mostly ineligible voters that they need to use that pain and turn it into power by tapping friends and family who can vote. 'Practically An American Without Papers' The irony is, Rodriguez is himself undocumented. His mother brought him from Mexico to the U.S. illegally when he was a child. He calls himself a \"Dreamer.\" He's college educated but has fallen short of the law degree he aspired to, thwarted by a lack of financial aid. On June 15, President Obama ordered a stop to the deportations of younger illegal immigrants who came to the U.S. as children and have no criminal history. Obama's plan to defer action on deporting young illegal immigrants applies to Rodriguez, but he said he still worries about his future. Chatting at the coffee shop he uses as his makeshift office, Rodriguez acknowledges that mobilizing in his community is not an easy task. It's not like it was four years ago, Rodriguez says, when people seemed fired up about national politics. \"Before, I remember in 2008 when President Obama was running for office, [because of the] historical importance of his presidency he mobilized a lot of people of color, like Latinos, to come out there and vote. And I was out there getting people registered to vote, because we believed that change was going to happen, and that it was going to happen immediately,\" recalls Rodriguez. \"But now, four years after he was elected, and we saw that immigration reform did not pass. We saw record numbers of deportations,\" says Rodriguez. \"Not a lot of Latinos are very enthusiastic this time to come out and vote. I think one of the ways that we're trying to combat that is by saying, you have two reasons to come out there and vote. One is to stop SB 1070 and laws like it. And two, the president already took a stance. The president already gave his deferred action to people that were qualified traditionally under the DREAM Act. And if we want to move forward, we need to elect a president that supports that.\" Rodriguez, 26, says Obama's decision to defer action on deporting some young illegal immigrants was clearly a political move. \"The difference between what we're seeing now and what would have happened three or four years ago, is that now it's a political move by the president that he needs to make in order to win re-election, because of the growing power of Latino voters,\" says Rodriguez. \"It's definitely progress.\" Rodriguez moved to the U.S. with his family when he was 7. He says if he could, he would vote. \"To see people that have that privilege and not take it, and because they don't take it we have people elected that create laws that hurt me, that hurt my family, that hurt our communities. It can get frustrating,\" he says. \"I am practically an American without papers, and because of that I don't have the power to vote,\" says Rodriguez. \"So, the best thing I can do now is organize those that can, and make them vote for me.\" A 'Sleeping' Voting Bloc True to his word, Rodriguez heads out in 111-degree heat to canvass in the Phoenix neighborhood where he grew up. His partner is fellow activist Maxima Guerrero of the group Promise Arizona. As they walk through the neighborhood, the shades are drawn on every house. The few people who answer open their doors only partly, or peer at them through grated screens. Their goal is to register 40,000 voters in Maricopa County. But on this day, they're not having much luck. Most of the people they encounter are ineligible to vote. One is a resident but not a citizen. Others may be here illegally. One is a felon, still on probation. Finally, Jacqueline Duarte comes to the door. She's 19 and already registered to vote. She's not really following the national election, at least not yet. But ask her about immigration, and it's a different story. \"People are leaving. They can't fix papers. I know people that have been here for like 20 years, and they still can't fix anything,\" says Duarte. \"So, I don't know, we just need change or something.\" Those are concerns that Arizona State University political science professor Rodolfo Espino says are reverberating through Latino communities everywhere. Like all voters, Latinos care about the economy and unemployment, but he says: \"In the aftermath of the signing of SB 1070, what was one of the top concerns for Latino voters? Immigration.\" And, Espino says, immigration remains a top concern after the Supreme Court decision on the law. Espino says that while Latino voters have long been considered the \"sleeping giant of American politics,\" their power as a voting bloc was minimal in past elections because they weren't concentrated in key battleground states. This year, with Latino populations on the rise in key swing states like Colorado, Nevada, Virginia and North Carolina, Espino says, it's a different story. \"Now [Latinos] can go to politicians at the national level and say, 'Hey, if you want to win national office, you have to listen to what we're asking for,' \" says Espino. \"And now, I think we're starting to see that.\"",

Professors and students are wondering whether the changes Obama announced will really help them. The president's executive action defers deportations for illegal immigrants who are 30 or under and meet certain conditions, giving them the ability to apply for a work permit. While some in the Latino community are celebrating the president's announcement, others say its effect on education is murky. \"It's talking about deferral of the process of deportation,\" says University of Georgia professor Betina Kaplan. \"It's talking about working permits. But it's not saying anything about education.\" Georgia bans illegal immigrants from attending the state's five most prestigious public colleges, including the University of Georgia. Kaplan says it's unclear whether schools will begin accepting these students again. \"I don't see any element that would put pressure on the schools in Georgia to lift the ban, but I think we have to wait and see,\" says Kaplan. 'Very Vague' Another concern is that state and local officials will have discretion as to whether illegal immigrants who meet the criteria will get deferred status. University of Georgia professor Lorgia Garcia-Pena says she worries students could identify themselves and end up at risk. \"A student could apply for this and still get deported. There's no process of appeal. There's no guarantee that the person that applies for this ... will receive it. It's really very vague,\" Garcia-Pena says. A University of Georgia spokesman says the school will look to the state Board of Regents for guidance on Obama's directive. The board says officials are examining the implications. State Sen. Barry Loudermilk, a Republican, supports banning illegal immigrants from attending all public colleges in Georgia. He says even if students get deferred status as the president has suggested, that doesn't mean they are legal residents. \"I think that's something that ... we're going to have to take a close look at,\" Loudermilk says. \"And will the state stand up and say, 'We're still not going to do this'? So does it really become law? In my opinion, it does not.\" Taxpayers are subsidizing public colleges, Loudermilk says, so that benefit should not go to students who are illegal immigrants.

South of Atlanta in Griffin, Ga., Gustavo Madrigal is cleaning up dishes in the home his family rents. He came to the U.S. from Mexico when he was 9 and is undocumented. \"I never really knew what it would mean for me in college,\" Madrigal says. Madrigal was a good student in high school, with a 3.9 average his junior year. He found out in 12th grade, he says, that he wasn't eligible for most scholarships. \"I don't think education should be about immigration status. It should be about merit. And I mean, the University of Georgia \u2014 I could have made a huge contribution to it by going there and studying there,\" he says. Now 20, Madrigal is with the Georgia Undocumented Youth Alliance, a group lobbying for passage of a bill that would allow a pathway to citizenship. He says this latest White House announcement is not enough. \"We don't want people to end [up] working at McDonald's the rest of their lives, you know. Not that that's not respectable but, you know, there's just so much potential with our community that it would be a shame to see it go ... to waste and nothing happen with it,\" Madrigal says. Another undocumented immigrant, Keish Kim, 20, came to the U.S. from South Korea when she was 8. She graduated from high school but is also unable to attend college here despite good grades. \"We've been delaying and putting thousands of people on a limbo state for over a decade,\" she says. Kim sees Obama's announcement as mostly a political move. \"I definitely don't want to belittle President Obama's step, [his] courage to stand up and announce that memo, but I think we have to be cautious. I am cautious about it and very hesitant,\" Kim says. Kim says students want to see concrete action that would allow them to pursue their education legally. She worries the directive could be overturned if Obama is not re-elected.",

            "article_content": "Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney addressed Latino elected officials in Orlando on Thursday. After a primary season in which he talked of \"self-deportation\" among immigrants and vowed to veto the Dream Act, Romney was greeted skeptically. He said his immigration policy would include a path to citizenship for illegal immigrants who serve in the U.S. military and green cards for those who earn advanced degrees in the U.S.  MELISSA BLOCK, HOST: From NPR News, this is ALL THINGS CONSIDERED. I'm Melissa Block, hosting this week from NPR West in California. ROBERT SIEGEL, HOST: And I'm Robert Siegel in Washington, D.C. The tug-of-war is heating up over Latino votes. Last week, President Obama gained some ground when he offered to extend work permits to illegal immigrants who came to the U.S. as children. Today, Mitt Romney told a Latino audience in Florida that he would get rid of that policy, and find a more permanent solution. But as we hear from NPR's Scott Horsley, Romney offered no details. SCOTT HORSLEY, BYLINE: Mitt Romney has no illusion he's going to win the Latino vote in November, but he would like to whittle away at the president's big advantage. Four years ago, Mr. Obama won twice as many Latino votes as GOP nominee John McCain did. Romney told a convention of Latino politicians in Florida today, their support for the president should not be automatic. MITT ROMNEY: I believe he's taking your vote for granted. I've come here today with a very simple message: You do have an alternative. HORSLEY: The Latino vote's increasingly important across the country - and especially in certain swing states, including Nevada, Colorado and Florida. Romney complained the sour economy under Mr. Obama has been especially hard on Latinos, and he accused the president of breaking his campaign promise to reform immigration. ROMNEY: For two years, this president had huge majorities in the House and Senate. He was free to pursue any policy he pleased. But he did nothing to advance a permanent fix for our broken immigration system - nothing. HORSLEY: It takes a certain amount of chutzpah for Romney to make that charge since it was Republican opposition in the Senate that blocked immigration reform. That's why Mr. Obama resorted to executive action last week, granting those undocumented young people a two-year reprieve from deportation. Romney, who's taken a particularly hard line against illegal immigration, said today he would replace that policy with his own plan. ROMNEY: As president, I won't settle for stop-gap measures. I'll work with Republicans and Democrats to build a long-term solution. HORSLEY: Romney spoke in general terms about border enforcement, ID requirements for workers, and a path to citizenship for illegal immigrants who serve in the military. He said nothing else about how he'd handle illegal immigrants who entered the country as children. That left Tony Ortiz(ph) unsatisfied. TONY ORTIZ: We're still not getting the particulars, so I want to hear more. I didn't hear enough today. HORSLEY: As a city commissioner from nearby Orlando, Ortiz is playing the role of host at this convention. He's also a voter in a swing district of a swing state, where the Latino vote could make a big difference in November. ORTIZ: Latinos, if they come out and vote, yes. HORSLEY: That's still a big if. Mr. Obama's move on immigration last week could be seen as an effort to boost Latino turnout. The president will get a chance to make his own case to this same convention tomorrow.

Romney will address the National Association of Latino Elected and Appointed Officials, or NALEO, Thursday. Obama takes his turn Friday. The appearances come just a week after the president announced a new policy allowing some undocumented young people to stay in the U.S. Romney has stayed away from denouncing the move. Both candidates see garnering Latino votes as critical to winning. The economy is still the one and only main event of the presidential election, but there are some important sideshows: contraception, gay marriage, health care. The one side issue with potentially the greatest electoral consequences is immigration. The 'Enthusiasm Measure' Until he announced his immigration policy last week, Obama had the support of most Hispanic voters \u2014 but not the enthusiasm they had shown for him in 2008. That may be changing in part because of the decision not to deport young immigrants whose undocumented parents brought them here as children. Matt Barreto has just conducted a new survey for Latino Decisions, a political opinion research group. \"Obama went from a 19-point deficit on an enthusiasm measure to a plus-35, and that's over [a] 50-point turnaround, just through this single announcement,\" Barreto says. Obama's move also made immigration a big wedge issue for his opponent. Romney has repeatedly refused to say whether he would continue the president's policy. On Wednesday, the Romney campaign shut down a conference call on the economy after getting three questions about immigration. \"He is trying to walk a line as not to sound like he is hostile to Latinos,\" Rick Santorum, Romney's former rival for the GOP presidential nomination, said on CNN. Romney's Balancing Act The problem for Romney is that the president's new policy is very popular with independent voters and Hispanics, but it's extremely unpopular with many Republican base voters who consider it a form of amnesty. During the primaries, Romney himself condemned a similar policy known as the DREAM Act. \"The question is, if I were elected and Congress were to pass the DREAM Act, would I veto it?' And the answer is yes,\" Romney said at a campaign stop late last year. Voters will be hearing that statement a lot this fall. Obama told a group of Hispanic journalists that he may just run clips from the Republican primaries verbatim. \"Gov. Romney has no standing on this issue, on any of these issues, frankly,\" says David Axelrod, the Obama campaign's top political strategist. \"There's no reason for anyone in that community to see him as focused on their concerns and interests. He has dug himself in a great big hole.\" In an election that may be decided by turnout among base voters, Romney can't afford to anger anti-amnesty conservatives. He still needs Hispanic votes, though. \"Of all the 10 or 12 states that are theoretically in play, all of them have enough of a Hispanic population \u2014 for the most part \u2014 that could make a difference in a very close election,\" said Republican Sen. Marco Rubio of Florida, whose own efforts to craft a version of the DREAM Act were pre-empted by the president's new policy, at a reporters' breakfast sponsored by Bloomberg News. Rubio was referring to swing states with strong Hispanic populations such as Colorado, Florida, Nevada and New Mexico. Is Immigration The Key? In 2008, Obama won two-thirds of the Latino vote. Polls show he's still getting the same share of that vote, but with his support among white voters sagging, he will need to register more Latinos and get them to the polls. That will be tough. Latino registration has declined since 2008, but Barreto says the president's decision to suspend certain deportations gives him something to work with. \"There's something he can go out and campaign on. It's not just promises or 'I'll do this next time.' He actually has done something,\" Barreto says, \"and if there's a clear contrast there, with the other candidate saying, 'I don't know how I think about that,' that's a clear decision for Latinos. This is an important personal symbolic issue.\" Rubio says he doesn't agree that immigration policy is the key to the Hispanic vote. \"This idea that Hispanics, all they think about is immigration 24 hours a day, seven days a week, is just not true. I mean, they're like everybody else in the country,\" he says. \"They're worried about the future. They're worried about their kids' future. Their house is worth less than it used to be worth.\" Ed Gillespie, a senior adviser to the Romney campaign, thinks there's a way Republicans can do better than the 31 percent of the Hispanic vote Sen. John McCain of Arizona got when he ran for president in 2008. \"I believe a pro-legal immigration message, a pro-economic growth, a pro-job creation message, a pro-education reform message will be very resonant with Americans of Hispanic descent,\" Gillespie says. \"I believe as a result of that, we're going to see Gov. Romney's share of the Latino vote rise from the baseline of Sen. McCain's share.\" When Romney attends NALEO's political convention in Orlando, Fla., Thursday, he'll have a chance to make that case himself.",

            "article_content": "After a primary season of claiming the toughest stance against illegal immigration, Mitt Romney is trying to mend fences with the Latino community on Wednesday with a speech at a business group in Washington, D.C.  ROBERT SIEGEL, HOST: From NPR News, this is ALL THINGS CONSIDERED. I'm Robert Siegel. AUDIE CORNISH, HOST: And I'm Audie Cornish. After several days off the campaign trail, Mitt Romney was back today, speaking just a block from the White House he hopes to occupy in January. Romney appeared before the Annual Economic Summit of the Latino Coalition. That's a nationwide federation of Hispanic small business owners. The event gave Romney a chance to build support among Latinos who widely prefer President Obama and whose votes could be decisive this fall. NPR's David Welna was at the event and sent this report. DAVID WELNA, BYLINE: As a couple of hundred Latino business people wait for Mitt Romney to arrive for his speech at the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, Ecuadorian-born Carlos Salas(ph) chats with friends about this year's presidential race. Salas, who's in the hotel and resort business, says he likes President Obama, but knows very little about Mitt Romney. CHARLES SALAS: I want to hear that he's going to help support the Latino community and just be more involved, not just show up to events like this for votes, but just be more involved in the future, you know. WELNA: That uncertainty about Romney is shared by Mary Sirvent of Virginia Hispanic Chamber of Commerce. After leaving her native Venezuela 10 years ago, Sirvent will be voting this fall for the first time. MARY SIRVENT: You know, in the resource process to see what is my final decision. WELNA: Could you vote for Romney, do you think? SIRVENT: I don't know. HECTOR BARRETO: Ladies and gentlemen, please join me in giving a warm Latino Coalition welcome to Governor Mitt Romney. (SOUNDBITE OF APPLAUSE) WELNA: The welcome comes from Hector Barreto, the Latino Coalition chairman who headed the Small Business Administration under George W. Bush. As Romney steps up to read his speech from teleprompters, he makes no attempt to greet the crowd in Spanish. In fact, this man whose own father was born in Mexico barely acknowledges the ethnic origin of most of the people in the room. Instead, Romney sticks to his theme of this week, what he calls a national education emergency. MITT ROMNEY: Here we are in the most prosperous nation on Earth, but millions of our kids are getting a third world education and America's minority children suffer the most. This is the civil rights issue of our era and it's the greatest challenge of our time. (SOUNDBITE OF APPLAUSE) WELNA: Romney waits until the end of his speech to make an election year plea. ROMNEY: This could be more than our hope. It can be our future. It can begin this November in the choice you make, so I'm asking for your help. I need you guys to go out and get people across the community, to tell them how important this issue is. WELNA: Listening in the crowd is Republican consultant, Mary Cruz McGowan(ph). Romney's message, she says, is good, but she adds that he needs to change his tone. MARY CRUZ MCGOWAN: He has to connect with the Latino community at their level. He has to really understand not only - it goes beyond translation. It's actually knowing the culture and that's what he needs to do and he's going to do that with the help of many Hispanics like myself and others. There are many that support him. WELNA: But Romney's past stands on immigration-related issues have alienated other Latinos. On the sidewalk outside the event, an undocumented college student, who gives her name only as Lucy(ph) and whose parents brought her from Peru at age 10, notes that Romney said nothing in his education speech about helping people like her achieve legal status through the DREAM Act. LUCY: I'm a Latina. You're asking for Latinos' help. Definitely not getting it with students. You know, there are citizens that are Latino that are not going to vote for a candidate like that if he's not supporting dreams of ours. WELNA: GOP consultant Ana Navarro says it's an issue Romney will have to deal with. ANA NAVARRO: He is going to have to talk about the DREAM Act. He is going to have to talk about immigration. He has talked about it already during the primary and he's going to have to talk about it in a broader sense come the general. It's certainly an issue that's not going to go away. WELNA: But one Romney chose not to deal with today. David Welna, NPR News, Washington. Copyright \u00a9 2012 NPR.  All rights reserved.

Marriott dines with his son Bill in a Hot Shoppe in March 1969. The elder Marriott was close to Mitt Romney's father, George. Mitt Romney has been far and away the best-funded of the Republicans running for president. In addition to his own campaign chest, he has the wealthiest superPAC backing him, Restore Our Future. Among the donors to Restore Our Future, are hotel tycoons J.W. and Richard Marriott. Each gave $750,000 so far this campaign cycle. Humble Roots The Marriott and Romney families have long been close. The roots of the Marriott family fortune stretch back to a simple root beer stand in Washington, D.C., some 85 years ago. That was where two Mormon transplants from Utah, J. Willard Marriott and his bride, Alice, began selling tamales along with root beer at a stand they named \"The Hot Shoppe.\" From that humble beginning arose a global hospitality empire. The company is no longer in the restaurant business, but there are now more than 3,000 hotels bearing the Marriott name. That growth was due in large part to J.W. Marriott Jr., known as Bill, who convinced his father to get into the lodging business in a big way. \"We've just been supportive of him. [If he] wants us to help out on certain things, then we're willing to help.\" Richard Marriott in The Boston Globe Jeff Beck, a professor at the School of Hospitality Business at Michigan State University and a former Marriott employee, says Bill Marriott made a big mark in the industry. \"I really think the mark is driving the Marriott name into all areas of the lodging industry, all market segments of the lodging industry and being a leader in coming up with new ideas,\" Beck says. For Bill Marriott, who recently stepped down as CEO of Marriott, and his brother Richard, who leads a Marriott spinoff called Host, being heirs to the family business has been lucrative. Both are listed on Forbes magazine's annual ranking of the 400 wealthiest Americans, each with a net worth of more than a billion dollars. Political Engagement The Marriott brothers have spent a bit of that fortune on politics. Not only did they donate $1.5 million to Restore Our Future, they've also given to congressional campaigns. Most but not all of their contributions have gone to Republicans. The company's political action committee has also been active. Bill Marriott talks to students at the Marriott School of Management on the Campus of Brigham Young University in Provo, Utah, on Tuesday. The school was celebrating his 80th birthday. \n                \n                    \n                    George Frey /Landov\n                    \n                \nhide caption Bill Marriott talks to students at the Marriott School of Management on the Campus of Brigham Young University in Provo, Utah, on Tuesday. The school was celebrating his 80th birthday. \"It was never for anything related to a particular party. It was more of a focus on what would be best for the lodging industry and what would be best for the tourism industry,\" says Beck, who says Marriott employees were encouraged to give to candidates with an eye toward helping the company. The one issue on which Bill Marriott has been publicly outspoken is immigration reform, perhaps not surprising given that he led a company that employs thousands in low-wage service jobs, many performed by immigrants. \"It's impossible to send 12 million undocumented immigrants home. We really need to cool the rhetoric and work together to come up with a federal solution \u2014 one that creates a workable verification system so that we employers know who we're hiring,\" Bill Marriott said at the National Press Club in 2008. It's unclear whether Romney's stand on illegal immigration matches Marriott's views. Romney has called for \"self deportation\" for illegal immigrants and seems to have ruled out giving them a legal path to citizenship. Shared Faith \u2014 And Deep Pockets But there are deeper ties between the Marriotts and the Romneys. The candidate's father, George, and J. Williard Marriott were good friends \u2014 so much so that Mitt Romney's given name is Willard. Romney served twice on the Marriott board. And there is their shared Mormon faith. \"The growth of Republican support among Mormons really took off in the late '70s thru the '80s when the Republican Party adopted its social conservative positions on abortion and gay marriage and women's rights and that's where you really saw the cementing of this relationship among Mormons and Republicans,\" says David Campbell, who teaches religion and politics at the University of Notre Dame. Campbell says a recent survey by the Pew Forum on Religion and Public Life indicates Mormons from both parties like Romney.  Bill Marriott gushed about then-GOP candidate Mitt Romney on Bloomberg TV in 2008. \"Mitt Romney is viewed very favorably among not just Mormon Republicans \u2014 which you would expect \u2014 but also among Mormon Democrats. This is a candidate who I think is thought to be an exemplar of the faith and the culture and so has a lot of support behind him on those grounds,\" Campbell says. Neither Bill nor Richard Marriott was available to be interviewed for this story. But Richard Marriott told The Boston Globe last year, \"We've just been supportive of him,\" adding if Romney \"wants us to help out on certain things, then we're willing to help.\" And during Romney's first run for the GOP nomination in 2008, Bill Marriott gushed with praise during an interview on Bloomberg TV. \"I've known Mitt Romney for a long time. He was on our board of directors for 10 years. He is extremely capable, competent, honest and a great family man. I think he'd make a terrific president. He's a wonderful leader and he's very bright and smart. He understands how to make decisions and gather the right information, and to me he's a very inspirational strong leader,\" Marriott said. But Marriott recently had some political advice for Romney. He told The Associated Press that Romney's message is too complicated and that his 59-point economic policy needs to be simplified. \"People aren't going to listen to 59 points,\" Marriott told the AP. Referring to the centerpiece of Herman Cain's campaign, Marriott said, \"they want 9-9-9.\"",

President Obama used humor to downplay a partisan tempest caused by a candid comment to Russian president Dmitri Medvedev that was picked up by an open mic in which Obama said he'll have \"more flexibility\" in missile-defense negotiations after re-election. The Environmental Protection Agency was expected to issue on Tuesday the first regulations restricting greenhouse-gas emissions from new power plants. The new standard is expected to be easily met by natural gas-powered plants but would essentially ban new coal-burning facilities since their emissions generally exceed the new limits. Rick Santorum has performed much better with Protestant evangelicals than with Catholics which has come as something of a surprise since the Republican presidential candidate is a very vocal Catholic himself. Some House Republicans are urging Speaker John Boehner and other GOP leaders to do more to acknowledge the reality of an improving economy and to start taking credit for the improvement instead of allowing Obama to claim all the credit. Newt Gingrich has started to charge $50 for posed photos with him at campaign events, which is being read as a signal that his presidential effort is desperate for cash to keep going. Some Senate Republicans, including Sen. Marco Rubio of Florida, were working on their own version of the DREAM Act which would offer a path to citizenship to certain young undocumented immigrants in an attempt to make the party more attractive to Hispanic voters.",

Hispanic voters face a choice this election season: continue to support Obama despite being disproportionately hurt by the economic downturn, or turn to Republicans at a time when many GOP presidential hopefuls have taken a hard line on immigration. There's a man in Phoenix with a political playbook that has become valuable. So valuable, the Obama campaign believes it could help clinch the president's re-election. Phoenix City Council Member Daniel Valenzuela is a fourth-generation Mexican-American. Last year, he won a seat on the Phoenix City Council in a traditionally Republican district, and he did it by increasing Latino voter turnout by 488 percent. \"I decided early on that this campaign would be a campaign for social behavioral change,\" Valenzuela tells weekends on All Things Considered host Guy Raz. \"To get people active, register to vote, realize the power of a vote and to get them to cast that vote.\" Latino voters continue to shape American politics, and this election season should see candidates on both sides courting the support of the fast-growing group. In Valenzuela's case, he did it the old-fashioned way. He recruited a group of local university students who knocked on 72,000 doors. Mobilizing For Issues One of Valenzuela's student volunteers was Vania Guevara, a first-generation American whose parents are from El   Salvador. Guevara says that the student volunteers were able to tap into the frustration many folks in the community felt over Arizona's tough anti-immigration laws. \"A lot of it was SB 1070 [anti-illegal immigration act] and what [Maricopa County Sheriff Joe Arpaio] was doing in our communities that really triggered it,\" Guevara tells Raz. \"Also, tuition increases, and a lot of our DREAM Act students basically got kicked out of school because of a proposition that increased tuition significantly.\" Critics say Arizona's new immigration law encourages profiling. Republican Sheriff Arpaio's office was cited by the Justice Department for \"pervasive culture of discriminatory bias against Latinos.\" And the DREAM Act, which proposes paths to citizenship for some children of immigrants who were brought to the U.S. illegally, is largely opposed by Republican lawmakers. The issues Guevara mentions \u2014 among others \u2014 mobilized so many people in western Phoenix that it eventually inspired a recent Time magazine cover story. \"In the end, we witnessed the greatest grass-roots effort in the history of Phoenix politics,\" Valenzuela says. The success prompted the Obama campaign to send an operative to Phoenix to learn more about Valenzeula's game plan and how to apply it nationwide; Valenzuela says he believes Arizona is in play this election. \"The Latino voter turnout increased by nearly 500 percent in one particular district,\" he says, \"but over the city of Phoenix, which is the sixth-largest city in the country, mind you, it actually increased by over 300 percent across the board.\" Latinos like the ones who voted in Phoenix \u2014 people who had never voted before \u2014 could turn out across the country in such numbers this year that they might hold the power to swing the presidential election. The way things are looking now, that's bad news for Republicans. \"When I hear some of the policies and the rhetoric that's coming out of the GOP debates, I hear very little other than anti-immigration reform,\" Valenzuela says. \"And those things bother me, personally, and I know that I'm not alone.\" Latino Voters And Republicans This past week, Fox News published a poll showing Republican presidential candidates Mitt Romney, Rick Santorum and Newt Gingrich winning just 14 percent of the Latino vote in an individual race against President Obama. More than half of U.S. population growth today is being fueled by the Latino community. The reason this is so important to presidential politics is because of where that population growth is happening. In addition to Arizona, states that have often voted Republican like Florida, Virginia and Colorado, have all seen growth in their Latino populations. But demographer Ruy Teixeira with the Center for American Progress says that could soon swing the other way. \"If President Obama polls 75 percent of the minority vote, he can lose white voters by huge margins and still win the election, including white working-class voters,\" Teixeira says. Teixeira says that if Obama can get the margin that he got in 2008 from Latino voters, he would get that 75 percent of the minority vote. While that that doesn't exactly make Obama bulletproof, Teixeris says, it certainly gets him a long way toward being re-elected. The long, competitive Republican primary is part of the reason more Latinos are turning away from the GOP, Teixeira says. He says Latino voters have taken notice of what's been said at the GOP debates on issues important to them. \"They're all against the DREAM Act; they're all against in-state tuition ... believe me, people notice and especially Latino voters notice,\" he says. \"It just reinforces this image of the Republican Party as being unwelcoming to immigrants.\" What Can Republicans Do? The same Fox News poll found that 60 percent of likely Latino voters believe the Democrats will help them achieve the American dream, while only 10 percent said the same for Republicans. Whit Ayres, the founder and president of North Star Opinion Research, a national public opinion research firm, is a Republican consultant who counts many of the party's leaders as clients. He agrees that doing better among Latino voters is one of the great challenges for Republicans, but he thinks the party can do far better than the poll suggests. \"In his re-election campaign in 2004, President Bush received 44 percent of the Latino vote nationwide,\" Ayres says. \"So we know that a candidate who reaches out and aggressively courts Latino voters can bring them into the Republican fold.\" Ayres says the state of economy and jobs is the most important issue in the Latino community today, and he believes focusing on those issues can draw in Latino voters. \"To present a picture of the Republican nominee as better for economic growth will mean that Republicans will do better in Latino communities,\" he says. Ayres says Latino voters are on track to become the No. 1 swing voter group in the country, and the seriousness of winning that vote for the GOP cannot be understated. What are the consequences for not taking it seriously? \"We'll lose,\" he says.",

The first-term Republican has been mentioned as a possible vice presidential pick. \n                \n                    \n                    Andrew Harnik/The Washington Times/Landov\n                    \n                \nhide caption Throughout the Republican presidential  primary season, whenever there's talk about a short list of possible running  mates, one name is nearly always at the top \u2014 Florida Sen. Marco Rubio. Rubio has only been in the Senate for a  little more than a year, but his appeal is obvious. He's a young, charismatic,  conservative Hispanic. But as his national profile has risen, he  has become a target for Democrats and advocacy groups who say he doesn't  represent Latino voters. In Miami last week, a dozen young Hispanic men and  women gathered outside Rubio's office last week chanting, \"Rubio: Latino  or Tea Partino?\" Helping to lead the chants was Esteban  Roncancio. He's 20 years old, studying computer engineering at Miami Dade College and is an undocumented immigrant.   He's a prime candidate for the DREAM Act, a bill that would give students and  members of the military who are in the U.S. illegally a path to legal residency. Out Of Step? According to surveys conducted by the Pew Hispanic Center, more than 90 percent  of U.S. Hispanics support the DREAM Act. Rubio opposes it. Roncancio said that shows Rubio is out of  step with his community. \"Especially among young Latinos,\" he said, \"we don't  feel that we're similar to him. We want him to really be with his people, with  his community, instead of with anti-immigrant Tea Party policies.\" Roncancio is part of Presente Action, a  pro-immigration Latino advocacy group that has targeted Rubio with its \"No Somos Rubios\"  campaign \u2014 \"We are not Rubios.\" Members of the group disrupted a speech  Rubio gave in January to the Republican-leaning Hispanic Leadership Network.    Rubio praised them for their courage in speaking out on an important issue, but  made light of the campaign and their slogan. I mean he's very well known obviously among folks close to Florida and among the Cuban-American population. But Mexican-Americans in the Southwest, they probably don't know much about him, and it's going to take time for them to even understand who he is and what his issues are. Gabriel Sanchez, University of New Mexico \"Someone is flying a plane over  the building with a banner that says, 'Marco, No Somos Rubio.'  Which means,  'Marco, we're not blond,' which by coincidence, neither am I,\" he said.  In Spanish, rubio means blond. As the only Hispanic Republican in the U.S.  Senate, Rubio has tried to stake out a nuanced \u2014 some would say inconsistent \u2014 position on immigration issues.   In recent weeks, he has scolded Republicans for using harsh rhetoric on  immigration.   But he has also said he respects Arizona's right to impose tough restrictions  on immigrants \u2014 restrictions that are opposed by a large majority of Latinos. Rubio says he opposes the DREAM Act because  it would set up a mechanism that he believes would encourage more illegal  immigration.  But, at the same time, he says something should be done for the  young people brought to the U.S. by their parents and who now want to serve in the  military or go to college. \"I believe there's broad bipartisan support for the notion that we should somehow figure out a way to accommodate  them,\" he says. A Rising Profile Although he has been in Congress for just over  a year, Rubio's national name recognition has risen because of the  vice presidential chatter.  It's talk he dismisses, saying he is focused on his  job as Florida senator. But his rising profile has made him a target  of attacks from the White House.  Rubio has been at odds with the administration  over a judicial nomination and U.S. policy in Central  America. Marco Rubio was born in Miami in 1971 to working-class Cuban  parents who emigrated from Cuba in 1956. He earned both his bachelor's and law  degrees in Florida and has spent most of his career in government and politics,  starting with internships and campaign positions. The first elected office he  held was city commissioner of West Miami, starting in 1998. Two years later, he  moved up to the Florida House of Representatives, where he spent eight years and  served as speaker of the House (the youngest ever in Florida, as well as the  first Hispanic) for the last two. In 2010, Rubio beat Gov. Charlie Crist for the  Senate seat he now holds. -- Natalie Jones Sources: National Journal, CQ, Washington Post More recently, he took heat from the White House for  backing an amendment, introduced by Missouri Republican Sen. Roy Blunt, that  would allow religious groups to opt out of providing birth control coverage as part of their health insurance plans.   The White House labeled it the \"Blunt-Rubio\" amendment even though Rubio was  just one of 23 co-sponsors. Last week, Rep. Luis Gutierrez, an Illinois Democrat, joined the criticism.  In a conference call organized by Presente  Action, Gutierrez accused Rubio of tailoring his message depending on whom he's  talking to. Of Rubio, Gutierrez said, \"Lately, he's  been going to the Latino microphones of America and saying, 'Well, I'm  telling my colleagues in the Republican Party that they should not be so harsh  with their rhetoric.'  But then he says something to a different audience,  including his Tea Party base.\" People in Rubio's office say they're not surprised by  the attacks.  Spokesman Alex Burgos says it's part of a concerted effort in a  campaign year to undermine a popular Republican senator. In Miami last week, protesters accused Rubio of being more in line with the Tea Party than Latino voters. \n                \n                    \n                    Greg Allen/NPR\n                    \n                \nhide caption In Miami last week, protesters accused Rubio of being more in line with the Tea Party than Latino voters. Lately, Rubio has kept a low media profile.  He is working on an autobiography.  He released a few potentially  controversial tidbits recently, such as the fact that as a child he was baptized and  raised Mormon before embracing Catholicism.   It's the kind of thing you might  do if you're being considered soon for a high office \u2014 like the  vice presidency. Gabriel Sanchez, an associate professor of  political science at the University of New  Mexico, says if Rubio is on the ticket, it's not  clear how much he'll do to help Republicans win over Hispanics.  A survey  conducted in November found more than a third of Hispanics had never heard of  him. \"I mean he's very well known  obviously among folks close to Florida and among the Cuban-American  population,\" Sanchez says. \"But Mexican-Americans in the Southwest, they probably don't know  much about him, and it's going to take time for them to even understand who he is  and what his issues are.\" And that's where Democrats and immigrant  advocacy groups come in \u2014 helping define who Rubio is, as Latinos across the  country are just getting to know him.",

Three of the top candidates have said they support only part of the proposal \u2014 an unpopular stance among the Latino voters the candidates are courting in the border state. A week ago, as Mitt Romney rallied supporters inside Mesa Amphitheater near Phoenix, another group rallied outside: immigrant students protesting his vow to veto the Development, Relief and Education for Alien Minors Act. The bill would provide a path to citizenship for undocumented people younger than 35 who serve in the military or go to college. But Romney said last month in South Carolina that people who enter the U.S. illegally \"should not be given favoritism or a special route to becoming permanent residents or citizens that is not given to those people who have stayed in line legally.\" He said he would support only the military portion of the DREAM Act, and rival candidates Rick Santorum and Newt Gingrich agree. That idea is offensive to \"Dreamers\" \u2014 undocumented immigrants who came to the U.S. illegally when they were young \u2014 who want to go to college, said 25-year-old activist Daniel Rodriguez. \"That's telling me I'm good enough to die for this country,\" Rodriguez said, \"but I'm not good enough to study for it and to help it through my knowledge.\" At a fundraiser for fellow Dreamer students in Phoenix, Rodriguez recalled coming to the U.S. at age 6 with his mother, who was fleeing domestic violence in Mexico. \"I'm told everyday that I'm not American,\" he said, \"but that's all I know and that's all I consider myself to be.\" Opposition To A 'Military Only' DREAM Act The Migration Policy Institute in Washington estimates that at least 2 million undocumented youths like Rodriguez could benefit from the DREAM Act. But the co-director of the institute's National Center on Immigrant Integration Policy, Margie McHugh, said many fewer would qualify for the military because of its strict educational and English-language requirements. \"It's hard to imagine that it would be worth passing legislation just for that small number,\" McHugh said. That's why 28-year-old Cesar Vargas said he doesn't like the idea of a \"military only\" DREAM Act, even though he wants to join the Marines. \"It tells you, you know, forget about your friends who want to go to college and you take advantage of this, and that's not how it's supposed to be,\" he said. The DREAM Act should be about more than just the military, said Dulce Matuz, president of the Arizona DREAM Act Coalition. She said it's meant for students who want to fight for the country with their bodies and minds. \"We need intelligent and talented individuals in this nation, and we've got to respect their decision to join the military or become a scientist,\" she said. The Latino Vote Matuz said she wants candidates to know there are consequences for their statements. \"We're going to be informing the Latino community about the facts,\" she said, \"even for President Obama \u2014 we're holding accountable the Republicans and Democrats alike.\" If the candidates keep talking like they are now, she said, the Latino community won't vote for them. But in an interview on Univision, a media outlet that serves a Hispanic audience, Gingrich said he's not worried about losing Latino voters: \"I have a hunch that by this fall, we may do better than any other Republican, except maybe Reagan.\" That's not likely, according to Rodolfo Espino, a professor of political science at Arizona State University. \"They've pretty much blown that opportunity to cater to the Latino vote,\" Espino said. But that doesn't mean President Obama is a shoo-in for the general election, he said. \"Democrats cannot just sit there and assume Latino voters are going to rush into the arms of the Democratic Party.\" Democrats need to show Latinos they're serious about immigration reform, Espino said, and passing the DREAM Act would be a good start.",

            "article_content": "Tune in for even a few moments to Spanish-language radio or TV  in Florida these days, and you'll hear ads touting the virtues of Mitt Romney and Newt Gingrich. Neither candidate speaks much Spanish, so the voice-overs are outsourced \u2014 sometimes to family members. One of those ads features Romney's son Craig, who spent a couple of years as a Mormon missionary in Chile and spoke fluently on behalf of his father, telling voters that his values and theirs are the same. But the ads to reach Latinos often aren't, says Matt Barreto, a co-founder of the polling research firm Latino Decisions. \"When we do analysis of campaign ads and look at the similarities and differences,\" he says, \"we usually find big differences in what Republican candidates are saying in their outreach in Spanish-language TV and radio, and in English-language TV and radio.\" That's happening now in Florida, where the heavily Hispanic Service Employees International Union launched an ad this week accusing Romney of pandering. Their ad, called \"Las Dos Caras de Mitt Romney\" \u2014 The Two Faces of Mitt Romney \u2014 goes on to say Romney's Spanish-language ads profess to care about the future of Latino children, even as he promises other, non-Latino audiences that he'll veto the DREAM Act, a path to citizenship for undocumented college students. Latino voters will see right through a Spanish overlay or a dubbed commercial that doesn't appear to be making any personal or real connection. Matt Barreto, co-founder of polling research firm Latino Decisions Gingrich got a crisp public admonition from Florida's junior senator, Marco Rubio, for calling Romney \"anti-immigrant\" in one Spanish-language ad. Rubio, perceived by many to be  a swiftly rising GOP star and a possible choice for vice president, isn't endorsing either candidate, but he felt the charge was untrue and unseemly. That ad has since been pulled. It's a serious misstep for Gingrich, who had already raised the ire of millions of Latino voters in 2007, when he made this observation: \"We should replace bilingual education with ... immersion in English, so people learn the common language of the country and so they learn the language of prosperity, not the language of living in a ghetto.\" He quickly followed that with an apology in Spanish, saying he'd just meant English was the pathway to the key to success \u2014 for opportunities in good jobs, education and more. He meant no offense,  Gincrich said, and hoped Latinos understood his comments were made with a  sincere heart for their ultimate well-being. Jackie Kennedy, 1960 George W. Bush, 2004: \"Mi Familia\" Sincerity  Trumps Accent A corazon sincero -- a sincere heart \u2014 is essential, says Barreto, in effectively reaching Latino audiences. And voters  can tell when a candidate has one \u2014 and doesn't.  \"Latino voters will see right through a Spanish overlay or a dubbed commercial that doesn't appear to be making any personal or real connection,\" he says. Gingrich and Romney might do well to take a page from George W. Bush's playbook, adds Casey Klofstad, a political science professor at the University  of Miami. \"If you go back to President Bush's two campaigns, he made a very concerted effort nationally, and especially in Florida, to really make outreach and inroads with the Latino electorate,\" he says, \"and it really yielded dividends.\" Bush has Hispanic relatives: His half-Mexican nephew, George P. Bush, barnstormed Florida on behalf of his Tio Jorge, to great effect.  Other ads paid homage to Bush's Texas upbringing. GOP candidates will no doubt continue to refine their Spanish-language ads as they make their way through the primaries. But they'll need to do it authentically, or they'll end up saying \"Disculpame\" \u2014 I'm sorry \u2014 a lot more as the months wear on.",

            "article_content": "Mitt Romney hasn't had a lot of good news lately but he did get some positive information Wednesday \u2014 a new Univision/ABC News poll gives him a significant lead over Newt Gingrich among Florida Latinos less than a week before the Florida Republican primary. The survey found that 35 percent of respondents said they would vote for Romney while 21 percent said Gingrich was their choice. Rep. Ron Paul was at six percent and Rick Santorum at seven percent. Voters who describe themselves as Hispanic or Latino make up about 10 percent of the Republicans likely to vote in Florida's closed primary on Tuesday. If the contest turns out to be close, their support could prove pivotal in deciding the outcome. That Romney is doing better with Florida Latinos even though he has a more hard line position on undocumented workers than Gingrich underscores how the issue of immigration is more nuanced in the Sunshine State than elsewhere. The state's large Cuban-American and Puerto Rican populations, for instance, are less concerned about immigration because of their special status under U.S. law. Cubans gain residency after a year; Puerto Ricans are U.S. citizens. An economic message about jobs and housing has more resonance to Latinos in Florida than immigration so Romney has muted his tough talk on illegal immigration that he used in Iowa and South Carolina. While Romney has higher support than Gingrich among Hispanics, he trails President Obama for the same Florida voters.  Obama led Romney by ten percentage points, 50 percent to 40 percent. His lead over Gingrich was somewhat similar, 52 percent to 38 percent.",

If the election results were disappointing for Republicans nationally, they were devastating for the GOP in California. It wasn't just President Obama's 21-point margin of victory. California Democrats gained four seats in Congress and will have two-thirds majorities in both houses of the state Legislature. But the struggles of the California Republican Party began long before last week. In the past, Republicans have made history in California \u2014 there was the Reagan Revolution and Proposition 13, known as the \"taxpayers revolt.\" But just before this election, California Republicans made history of a different sort. It wasn't the kind of history anyone would brag about, says Dan Schnur, head of the Jesse M. Unruh Institute of Politics at the University of Southern California. \"When one of the two major parties sees its voter registration dip below 30 percent, that ought to be a warning sign that Election Day is not going to go particularly well,\" Schnur says. That's right \u2014 just 29.4 percent of California voters are now registered Republicans. Meanwhile, a growing number of all voters in California are Latino, now more than one-fifth of the electorate. In the past couple of elections, Latinos around the country voted roughly 2 to 1 for Democrats. But in California, Latinos have been fleeing the Republican Party since this ad ran in 1994: \"They keep coming,\" the ad said. \"Two million illegal immigrants in California. The federal government won't stop them at the border.\" Then-Gov. Pete Wilson, a Republican, hitched his re-election campaign to Proposition 187, which denied public services for illegal immigrants. That included banning children from public schools. And even though Proposition 187 was thrown out by the courts, \"the bill is coming due,\" says Raphael Sonenshein, executive director of the Pat Brown Institute of Public Affairs at California State University, Los Angeles. \"This has mobilized vast numbers of Latino voters. Now they're really pouring to the polls.\" The growing Latino vote definitely got the attention of Republicans on the national stage. Last Sunday on CBS's Face the Nation, South Carolina Sen. Lindsey Graham said the GOP must change its tune on immigration reform or risk further losses in the nation's fastest-growing voter group. \"We have nobody to blame but ourselves when it comes to losing Hispanics,\" he said, \"and we can get them back with some effort on our part.\" Graham proposed an immigration overhaul that included a path to citizenship. But California Republicans may not embrace that shift in policy. \"That's seen by many folks as rewarding people who've cheated the system, at the expense of people who've gone through the system legally,\" says Ron Nehring, a GOP strategist who was chairman of the state Republican Party until this year. Reaching out to Latinos won't by itself stem the Republicans' decline in California. Schnur says they face other demographic challenges: \"an electorate that is younger, an electorate that is more single, an electorate that is more urban.\" \"Each of these constituencies have favored Democratic candidates in the past,\" he says. So much so that in California, \"Republican\" is now a toxic label, Sonenshein says. \"Some Republicans are now re-registering as independents to run for office \u2014 simply not to have the word 'Republican' next to their name,\" he says. Schnur believes the GOP will not allow this to a happen on a national level. \"If national Republicans begin to rethink their outreach to some of these voting communities, then maybe that drags California Republicans along with them as well,\" he says. Preventing California from once again being a national trendsetter.",

The party's support has been boosted by anti-immigrant anger.\n                \n                    \n                    Sakis Mitrolidis/AFP/Getty Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption Members of the Greek ultranationalist Golden Dawn Party, sing the national anthem outside the party's office in Thessaloniki in June. The party's support has been boosted by anti-immigrant anger. When German Chancellor Angela Merkel visited Athens last month, a few Greek Army reservists in fatigues greeted her with chants of \"Get out, Nazis!\" Like other Greeks, they are furious over the drastic budget cuts Germany and other eurozone countries are demanding in exchange for billions in bailout loans.  The protesters compared the situation to Nazi Germany's brutal occupation of Greece during World War II, when more than 400,000 Greeks died.  But investigative journalist Dimitris Psarras hears other echoes of the past.  \"The economic crisis that Greece is facing today is similar to the one faced by Weimar Germany,\" he says. \"Just as Germany struggled to pay reparations imposed by the victors of World War I, Greece is now struggling to pay off giant debt racked up by its own corrupt political system.\"  Even Prime Minister Antonis Samaras has used the reference. In Weimar Germany, paramilitaries from the far right and far left fought in the streets. Germans struggled through head-spinning economic and political crises.  Then, in 1933, after parliamentary elections that gave the Nazi Party the biggest share of the vote, Adolf Hitler came to power.  Now Greece may have its own version of the Nazis, Psarras says, the Golden Dawn Party. He has researched the movement for more than two decades and just released a book, The Black Bible of Golden Dawn. Ilias Panagiotaros, deputy of the Greek Parliament and member of Golden Dawn, looks on before giving a speech in Athens in June.\n                \n                    \n                    Andreas Solaro/AFP/Getty Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption Ilias Panagiotaros, deputy of the Greek Parliament and member of Golden Dawn, looks on before giving a speech in Athens in June. Party On the Rise  Golden Dawn members say they are nationalists and strongly reject the Nazi label.   But at rallies, party members chant, \"Blood and Honor\" \u2014 a slogan adapted from the Nazis \u2014 and they wear black T-shirts with a swastika-like ancient Greek symbol called a meandros.  Last month, Golden Dawn supporters also attacked theatergoers before a performance of Corpus Christi, Terrence McNally's controversial play about a gay Jesus.  The leader of the mob, Ilias Panagiotaros, shouted homophobic and xenophobic obscenities at the terrified crowd.  Panagiotaros is one of 18 Golden Dawn members elected to Parliament last June. The party won support by promising to kick out illegal immigrants and jail all corrupt politicians. They have also promised to erase household debt for low-wage earners and the unemployed.  \"Every day we are growing,\" Panagiotaros says. \"And very soon we're going to be ruling this country, and laws are going to be enforced.\"  Indeed, Golden Dawn is rising in opinion surveys and could win as many as 36 seats in the 300-member Parliament, were elections held today.  Panagiotaros recently told the BBC that Greeks are divided.  \"Greek society is ready to have a fight, a new type of civil war,\" he said. \"On the one side there will be nationalists like us, and Greeks who want our country to be as it used to be, and on the other side illegal immigrants, anarchists and all those who have destroyed Athens several times.\" Supporters of Golden Dawn celebrate the results of the elections outside of their Thessaloniki headquarters in June. The tattoo reads \"Greece.\"\n                \n                    \n                    Dimitri Messinis/AP\n                    \n                \nhide caption Supporters of Golden Dawn celebrate the results of the elections outside of their Thessaloniki headquarters in June. The tattoo reads \"Greece.\" Violence Against Migrants  But it was another Golden Dawn lawmaker, a death-metal bassist named Giorgos Germenis, who helped smash the market stalls of immigrant vendors in the seaside town of Rafina this September.  Poor migrants are Golden Dawn's main target \u2014 and they're an easy one.   Issa Ahmed Agboluaje, a vendor from Ghana, says a gang of men in black T-shirts cornered him and a Nigerian friend near a church this spring.  \"They beat him so much, but they stabbed me,\" he says, lifting up his shirt to reveal a scar on his stomach. \"When I escaped from them, I saw my body was full of blood.\"  Human rights groups say racist gangs, some wearing black Golden Dawn T-shirts, have attacked hundreds of migrants this year.   They have the support of poor central Athens neighborhoods such as Agios Panteleimonas, where many residents say the immigrants are violent.   A mob of 150 Greeks, including some Golden Dawn members, recently destroyed migrant-owned shops in the neighborhood after a migrant stabbed a Greek barber.  Most newcomers are Africans, Afghans and Pakistanis who slip into the European Union through Greece, crossing the border from Turkey. More than 350,000 undocumented migrants reside in Greece, according to the Public Order Ministry. Many are desperate and living in squalor.  Public Order Minister Nikos Dendias calls them \"invaders.\" On his orders, police have now detained more than 40,000 foreigners \u2014 most of them dark-skinned \u2014 to check for residency permits. Those without permits are supposed to be deported. Blaming Immigrants   Stathis Boukouras, a Golden Dawn lawmaker from the southern city of Corinth, blames undocumented migrants for a rise in crime in urban areas. He wants them out of Greece immediately. But he denies that Golden Dawn assaults them.  \"If some kid decides to wear a Golden Dawn T-shirt and beat up a Pakistani, that's not our fault,\" Boukouras says. \"We didn't order him to do it.\"  But Psarras says, the party clearly promotes violence. Its supporters, who are fed up with a failing Greek state, actually welcome it.  \"They consider it violence against the system,\" he says. \"I've heard many people say, 'Yes, I know they're Nazis. I know they're violent. But I voted for them so they could get into Parliament and beat up lawmakers and government ministers.' \" Golden Dawn supporters are so angry about the state of Greece, he says, that they don't care about the consequences. All they want is revenge.",

            "article_content": "As the presidential campaign has unfolded, the candidates have traded polemics about wealth, class warfare, taxes, dependency and the role of government. While it may be uncomfortable to admit, some Americans are simply more financially successful than others. But why do some achieve wealth, while others struggle? Why does one woman make it to the executive suite, while another man drives a taxi? And what do we think explains our prosperity \u2014 or lack thereof? All Things Considered host Robert Siegel visited North Carolina's Research Triangle area to ask people from very different walks of life how they account for their economic station in life. In the final installment of the series, we talk with several people who are on some of the lowest rungs of the economic ladder \u2014 but are working hard to move up. The child of a farmworker, Yesenia Cuello aspires to become a nurse. She supports herself through school by working at McDonalds.\n                \n                    \n                    Art Silverman/NPR\n                    \n                \nhide caption The child of a farmworker, Yesenia Cuello aspires to become a nurse. She supports herself through school by working at McDonalds. At a board meeting of NC Field, a North Carolina nonprofit that serves farm workers, a consultant with a flip chart is going over budget assumptions and fundraising goals. Yesenia Cuello, president of the organization's youth group, is here. Cuello, 20, was born in Los Angeles, but lives in the tiny town of Pink Hill, N.C. Her Mexican-born mother, who is single, moved east and brought the kids with her. \"There was four of us at the time,\" Cuello tells All Things Considered host Robert Siegel. \"Right now there are six, so my mom was mother and father for all six of us.\" Cuello's mother, her brother and a sister all work in the fields. Cuello herself was picking tobacco at age 14. \"It's mostly bending down,\" she says. \"The heat is what's tough.\" Cuello says the wages, about $7.25 an hour, keep her siblings going back to farm work. But she's not going to join them, she says. \"When I was working there, I was like, this is not what I'm going to be doing for the rest of my life.\" Studying Hard To Move Up Instead, Cuello is pursuing a nursing assistant certificate. She hopes to finish college and become an RN. She supports herself by working about 30 hours a week at McDonalds. Cuello figures she can make about $12,000 a year at that rate. She says she believes in hard work, family and education, and that prayer helps her relax. But she also cites one key decision that accounts for her current upward mobility away from the farm-working life: Unlike many of her peers, Cuello is childless. \"I'm not ready for that,\" she says. \"All that comes later.\" Cuello doesn't think luck has much to do with her current economic situation \u2014 or her drive to leave farm work behind. But she does believe in working hard to get ahead. \"I don't think that somebody's academically gifted,\" she says. \"It's all based on, I believe, studying and work. I did a whole lot of studying. ... I believe it's just a whole lot of studying and memorizing stuff that gets you where you are.\" Cuello says government programs have been an important source of support for her and her family. \"My mother received food stamps and we get Medicaid. ... They're a lot of help,\" she says, along with free school lunch, training in English as a second language, and her public school education. Young, Undocumented And Making His Own Luck Oscar Chairez, 20, has also had the benefit of a public education. Born in Mexico, his mother brought him to Clayton, N.C., when he was 3. He's lived in this town, about 16 miles southeast of Raleigh, ever since. After high school, Chairez got a full-time job at the factory where his mother swept floors; he even became a supervisor. All was going well until earlier this year, when he says Homeland Security officials came to the plant and checked Social Security numbers. He and his mother, both undocumented, lost their jobs. Chairez, single and without kids, is trying to stay in the country under Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, the new program that enables some undocumented immigrants who came here as children to remain. A part-time college student, he says he has no financial aid for school. Chairez says he's making about $15,000 a year with part-time work, presumably being paid by someone off the books. Chairez says he's in a bad way, but that other young people are a lot worse off. \"I know of people younger than I am [who] have to work jobs not to support themselves, but to support their family,\" he says. \"Their mother might be unemployed, and he might have or she might have three or four more younger brothers and sisters.\" Chairez says his own siblings \u2014 all citizens \u2014 live with his mother, and \"they're making ends meet.\" When it comes to his own financial situation, Chairez says he feels he's doing \"a whole lot better than a lot of other people ... because of hard work. And if I'm still not as far ahead as I want to be, it's because I haven't worked hard enough.\" When asked if intelligence plays a role in where he is today, Chairez says, \"I consider myself smarter than the average bear, and I look at where I am and what I can do with my own hands ... there are other people who aren't quite as academically gifted as I am, and I kinda know that they've got a hard road ahead of them.\" And where does luck come in? \"I can probably take a few of the other factors, such as hard work and brains, and make my own luck,\" Chairez says. Making Progress, And Afraid Of Losing Ground Johnita Ellerby is also struggling to leave poverty behind. Ellerby, 35, is a single mom with four children. They live in Sanford, N.C., where she works full time as a certified nursing assistant while also attending college for social work on a scholarship. Ellerby is getting by, but she also lives with fear that the gains she's making could slip away. \"I still have that uncertainty, about what could happen if my scholarships stop,\" she says. \"Sometimes I get scared, sometimes I get afraid ... how long can I do it, how long will the safety net be there for me.\" Johnita Ellerby, a single mother of four, is studying social work while working full time. She fears her progress could be erased if she loses her scholarship.\n                \n                    \n                    Art Silverman/NPR\n                    \n                \nhide caption Johnita Ellerby, a single mother of four, is studying social work while working full time. She fears her progress could be erased if she loses her scholarship. Ellerby grew up poor, black and religious. Hers was a loving family, she recalls, but she also says she was molested by a male relative as a child \u2014 and later abused by a husband. Unlike Cuello, Ellerby thought the way out of poverty was to have children \u2014 not put them off. She had her first child when she was 16. And while she knew she was smart, she feels having a child altered others' expectations of her. \"Teachers would often tell me I was smart \u2014 would often even find out that I was in the wrong classes, I should have been in higher classes,\" Ellerby says. \"But I think the fact that I had a child, no one took the time to say, 'OK, well, you can still go to college anyway.' \" Ellerby says support from her community plays a tremendous role in her current station in life \u2014 and her efforts to transcend her economic status. \"My friends and my family ... support my journey with my education,\" she says. \"You know, offering something like a bag of groceries, a jug of milk. Offering to watch my kids while I work a 16-hour shift.\" That kind of help, Ellerby says, \"has been the way I've been able to survive.\" Ellerby also gives special credit to an act of philanthropy. To go to college and live in the community where she does \u2014 as opposed to the gang-infested part of Sanford where she once lived \u2014 her rent and scholarship are paid by Doris Buffet's Sunshine Lady Foundation. Ellerby says her kids give her great joy \u2014 and the philanthropic support she's received, she says, means her children are starting out in a much better place than she did.",

            "article_content": "A group of immigration agents on Thursday filed a lawsuit against the Obama administration, claiming that following new lenient deportation policies requires them to violate the law. The 10 Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents say they are under orders not to arrest certain illegal immigrants who might qualify for the administration's new deferred deportation program, according to the complaint filed in a Texas federal court. The agents say they are prevented from verifying people's eligibility for deferment, violating federal law that requires agents to detain suspects before determining their status. Agents who have tried to pursue arrests anyway have been threatened with suspensions, the plaintiffs allege. Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano and ICE Director John Morton are named as defendants. The plaintiffs are represented by attorney Kris Kobach, the Kansas secretary of state better known nationally as the architect of the tough immigration-enforcement laws in Arizona and other states. (The Supreme Court in June significantly weakened the Arizona law. A federal court in Atlanta recently followed in kind with rulings against similar laws in Alabama and Georgia). Kobach also is legal counsel to the Immigration Reform Law Institute , the legal arm of the Federation for American Immigration Reform, which opposes amnesty and favors stricter enforcement of existing laws. \"They are being ordered by their federal-appointee superiors to break federal law, or if they don't break federal law, according to their orders they will be disciplined,\" Kobach told reporters on a call Thursday. \"This is an absolutely breath-taking assertion of authority and an abuse of authority.\" Numbers USA, which advocates for reduced immigration and opposes deferred deportation, is paying the legal fees for the agents. The group and many Republicans have criticized the program as a backdoor to amnesty. Many Republican opponents deride it as election-year ploy by President Obama to boost his support among Latino voters. Obama in July issued an executive order halting the deportations of undocumented immigrants who came to the U.S. as children. The policy, which took effect Aug. 15, allows the young people to come out of hiding, obtain work permits, and a social security number. Depending on state laws, they may be entitled to professional certificates, driver's licenses and in-state tuition for college. The program defers deportations for two years, which can be extended. As many as 1.7 million people could be eligible if they arrived in the U.S. before age 16 and have lived here for at least five years, and attend school or have served in the military. They can't be older than 30 or have criminal records. The lawsuit says the executive order violates the separation of powers by usurping the lawmaking authority of Congress. The Obama administration has said the president issued the order under his existing legal authority. He didn't seek the approval of Congress, which has voted against measures to benefit illegal immigrants, including legislation known as the DREAM Act that served as a model for the deferred action program. The complaint also targets ICE's previous attempt, in 2011, to scale back enforcement against young people and others by granting agents \"prosecutorial discretion\". The ICE agents' union has been outspoken in opposing deferred action and prosecutorial discretion. Plaintiff Chris Crane, an ICE officer and president of the National ICE Council, the bargaining unit for about 7,000 agency employees, says threats of retaliation, in the form of suspensions, allegedly made by supervisors have made working conditions for agents untenable. \"We have officers that are under threats of losing their jobs and retirements if they refuse what we believe are unlawful orders,\" Crane told reporters. \"The administration has been less than honest in saying what policies ICE agents have to use in the field... We have repeatedly tried to work with the administration, but they have just excluded us, from day one.\" Kobach also has advised Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney on immigration policy. He said he informed the campaign of his intention to file the suit, but hasn't discussed the case with campaign officials. Romney has criticized deferred deportation but hasn't said if he'd end it. He has proposed an unspecified \"civil but resolute\" fix to illegal immigration. (Corey Dade is a national correspondent for NPR.) Update on Friday, Aug. 24, Response From DHS: The Department of Homeland Security sent us this statement saying that DHS always uses \"prosecutorial discretion\" to be able to focus on deporting criminals. It added: \"In FY 2011, ICE removed more than 216,000 convicted criminal aliens, the largest number in the agency's history and an 89 percent increase in the removal of criminals since the previous administration. Overall, more than ninety percent of ICE's removals fell within our priority categories. \"The Secretary's memo on Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals is a continuation of the Department's focus on these priorities, and ensures that responsible young people, who are Americans in every way but on paper, have an opportunity to remain in the country and make their fullest contribution. This policy is a temporary measure; Congress must still act to provide a permanent solution to fix the broken immigration system.\"",

That was before the Arab Spring. How right he was, and yet how quickly we forget that the populist uprisings in Tunisia, Libya, Egypt, Yemen, Syria and other autocracies took their cue and their methods from the uprising in Iran, a non-Arab Islamic republic often seen as a bigger threat to the West than all the others put together. To an impressive degree, the huge, nonviolent demonstrations in Tehran were built through Twitter, YouTube, cellphone chains and videos, and through the myriad postings of a nation of obsessive bloggers. Inspiring and devastating by turns, The Green Wave charts the movement's heady rise and dispiriting fall with multiple narrative strategies that mirror the techno-tools used by both sides in a war that was fought first on the Web, then in bloody street violence. The tweets, blogs and phone trees brought throngs of people into the streets and the voting booths, where they also helped voters make sense of the government's deliberately confusing procedures. Just as quickly, the government shut down the Internet, ran wildlife documentaries on television throughout Election Day, then lowered the boom by sending out squads of plainclothes thugs to terrorize, imprison and club the marchers into submission. Ahmadinejad won the rigged election by a wide margin, and an uneasy order was restored. With the foreign press expelled, little official record remains of the revolt other than a few woozy videos, like the one that went viral after capturing the brazen shooting of the beautiful student Neda. That footage of her murder, and her friends' desperate attempts to revive her, is included in The Green Wave, but it takes its place among a lot of other, previously undocumented heartbreak. Iranian feature filmmakers have long been adept at working around censorship by encoding political commentary into microscopic fictions of everyday life \u2014 Jafar Panahi's The White Balloon, say, or any film by Abbas Kiarostami \u2014 that play like documentaries. The Green Wave, by contrast, is a doc that plays like a multimedia tragedy. Based in Germany, director Ali Samadi Ahadi turns the lack of official reporting to imaginative advantage, bringing spoken blogs of composite students to life with animated illustrations, grainy cellphone camera captures, news footage and interviews with exiled activists, journalists and lawyers. The protests were firmly stamped down by Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, who went on to win what were widely considered to be rigged elections.\n                \n                    \n                    Dreamer Joint Venture\n                    \n                \nhide caption The protests were firmly stamped down by Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, who went on to win what were widely considered to be rigged elections. The movie shows what happened, but it also conveys what it felt like to travel from euphoria to despair in the space of a few weeks. Alireza Darvish's drawings are beautiful and horrifying, the students' faces sharply etched with zigzagging lines and shadows that underscore the trauma expressed in their writings. Nocturnal cityscapes of Tehran change color to reflect the shifting mood of a city first energized by the hopes and dreams of its young dissenters, then terrorized by the goons who moved in to bludgeon, arrest, torture and shoot them in plain sight or behind bars. Everywhere, the emerald green of renewal stands out in hair, nails, hijabs, T-shirts and a huge bolt of bright green cloth snaking through the city center, carried aloft by thousands of jubilant demonstrators before the boot came down. Green is also the color of Islam, and the movie's ardently spiritual tone says much about the complex role religion plays in the politics of the region. Many of the protesters are Muslims, disillusioned not by Islam but by its perversion to build a regime every bit as totalitarian as that of the Shah that preceded it. If Iran, or any of the other Arab Spring nations achieve democracy, they will do it their way, not ours. But we have a responsibility, the exiled activists say, to spread the word about what is happening in Iran at this moment. Nobel Prize-winning lawyer and human rights activist Shirin Ebadi, now living in the U.K., quietly tells the West, if you want to worry out loud about us, don't just worry about your relationship to our oil and our nuclear arsenals. Worry about the gross human rights violations that continue today under Ahmadinejad. In the short run, the bullies have won. The longer haul remains to be seen, but for now the sad judgment, if not the last word, goes to a blogger, reflecting in the movie on how she felt on emerging from prison after being beaten and tortured. \"You realize that you have merely left a small prison for a bigger one. The prison called Iran.\" (Recommended)",

            "article_content": "Francisco Cortes started at Fox as an apprentice, then rose through the ranks to become Fox News Latino's first director.\n                \n                    \n                    Courtesy of FOX News Latino  \n                    \n                \nhide caption This is the first in a three-part series about major American networks trying to appeal to a broader Latino audience. In a glass-walled conference room at Fox News in New York, reporter Bryan Llenas and two of his colleagues discuss the nature and success of their news site, Fox News Latino, largely aimed at English-speaking Hispanics. Maybe a dozen feet away, two pundits can be seen heatedly arguing in a Fox News TV studio. \"Fox News Latino is different than Fox News,\" Llenas says with a smile. \"You know what? That's the purpose \u2014 to add value.\" As Hispanics make up an increasing \u2014 and increasingly important \u2014 part of the U.S. population, major media companies are courting them with a newfound intensity. Latinos make up one-sixth of the nation's population, but accounted for more than half of the country's population growth from 2000 to 2010, according to the latest census. The Univision and Telemundo television networks have sewn up much of the nation's Spanish-dominant viewers; in fact, Univision is one of the nation's highest-rated broadcast networks in any language. But news organizations see major opportunities in targeting Hispanics who predominantly speak English, and Fox News Latino has been enjoying a strong head start by tweaking the formula that defines the cable network that gave it life. The site drew 3.3 million unique visitors in June, according to estimates from Omni Site Catalyst provided by Fox, and that's considered a strong showing for a niche site. \"They're very good,\" says Angelo Falcon, a political scientist, activist and president of the National Institute for Latino Policy. \"They cover a lot of issues that are important to the Latino community ... They cover things that the mainstream media really doesn't pay much attention to.\" Speaking To The Latino Community Fox News Latino doesn't treat American Hispanics as a monolithic cultural, economic or political force. And that can be credited with some of its early fortune. The site started up in late 2010, with a push from Fox News Chairman Roger Ailes. Fox News Latino Director Francisco Cortes was rising through the ranks \u2014 from an apprenticeship named for Ailes to a senior producer for Fox's news programming \u2014 when he was summoned by his bosses. \"Mr. Ailes himself ... wanted to see how to strategize on how to speak to the Latino community,\" Cortes recalls. \"They wanted to know ... how do we go about talking to one of the most influential groups in the U.S.\" With colleagues, Cortes devised a website that features staff-written pieces and aggregates news coverage from other sources, particularly abroad. The site's articles are largely in English. \"Our target audience is second- and third-generation U.S. Hispanics,\" Cortes says, \"but we also don't want to ignore first-generation Hispanics who have deep ties to their homeland.\" The site has paid particular attention to such stories as the recent presidential elections in Mexico, the triumphs and troubles of Hispanic politicians, and congressional clashes over immigration policy. Lighter pieces include a look at a Mexican-style rodeo held in the Bronx. A Divide Between Fox News And Fox News Latino Yet some Hispanic activists and critics on the left say there is a pronounced divide between their treatment on the Fox News Latino website and on Fox News itself, especially on the cable channel's highly rated opinion shows. \"You have someone like Bill O'Reilly who's always out looking to take potshots at Latino advocacy groups and Latino issues. [He's] very anti-immigrant,\" says political scientist and activist Falcon. O'Reilly would undoubtedly disagree with that assessment. But during one recent exchange, he invited a Latina campaigning against use of the word \"illegals\" onto his top-rated Fox News show, The O'Reilly Factor, only to ask her four times whether she was an illegal alien. (The activist, Monica Novoa, said she was not, all four times.) But the website also has the potential to inform and influence the news channel's coverage. In March, for example, Fox News Latino's Llenas appeared on Fox News to describe the results of a poll commissioned by the website. Llenas noted that Hispanic voters care more about the economy than immigration, but said that the latter issue defines their moral compass. \"Eighty-five percent support undocumented workers working in this country,\" he said on the air. \"If you ask them whether they prefer the word 'illegal' versus 'undocumented,' a majority of them believe that the word 'illegal,' the term 'illegal immigrant,' is offensive.\" In May, Fox News' Geraldo Rivera wrote a column for the site denouncing pundits \u2014 including those on the Fox News channel itself \u2014 for using the term. Competition Is Catching Up Now, however, the site is facing new competition in their pursuit of English-speaking Hispanics. A year ago, The Huffington Post created HuffPost LatinoVoices, and a few weeks ago, NBC News unveiled its version. NBC News' top digital executive, Vivian Schiller, says news officials all over are seeking to tap into the same growing and previously underserved market. \"Advertisers are interested in reaching Latino audiences. And so this is a commercial venture in the sense that we sell advertising, and we think it is a good business,\" Schiller, a former NPR CEO, said during a public question-and-answer session at the Chautauqua Institution in upstate New York. \"But it is also a critically important project for us, and I feel a tremendous responsibility to serve diverse audiences.\" Fox executives say they are driven by the same impulses: to find future sources of profit and to serve the public better. A One-Stop Shop For News Elizabeth Llorente, senior reporter at Fox News Latino, grew up in Union City, N.J., with a blend of American tastes and those of her family's native Cuba. She's a fan of Celia Cruz and the Rolling Stones. Before joining Fox's new website, Llorente won awards for her coverage of immigration issues at the Bergen County Record in New Jersey. For intellectual nourishment that touched on her interests, she says she used to concoct her own stew from a variety of news sources: \"I'd go to The New York Times; I'd go to Univision; I'd go to the ethnic newspaper serving the community.\" \"Here at Fox News Latino, it's all there for you,\" she says, \"so you don't have to be making your own stew.\"",

Obama hit the campaign trail this week, shadowed by a week of fateful events at home and abroad weighing heavily on his hopes of re-election.\n                \n                    \n                    Jewel Samad/AFP/Getty Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption President Barack Obama greets supporters upon arriving at Miami International Airport in Miami, Fla., on June 26. Obama hit the campaign trail this week, shadowed by a week of fateful events at home and abroad weighing heavily on his hopes of re-election. Read Another Opinion On Obama's Reelection Plan Nate Cohn is an elections blogger for The New Republic. The growing minority population has gradually reduced the share of the white vote required for Democrats to secure to win the Presidency. In 2004, Kerry won 41 percent of the white vote and lost by three percentage points. If Obama received 41 percent of the white vote, he would have won by three percentage points in 2008. With Obama poised to approach or repeat his historic performance among non-white voters, the question is whether minority voters will again turnout in record numbers, and whether Obama will win enough white voters to put him over the top. Will minority voters turnout? On Wednesday, Obama campaign officials predicted that minority voters would represent 28 percent of the electorate in 2012, up from 26 percent in 2008. The minority share of the voting eligible population grows every year, so increases in the non-white share of the electorate are certainly possible. Of course, diminished enthusiasm among young and black voters could prevent Obama from capitalizing on favorable demographic trends. The Obama campaign's recent decisions to endorse gay marriage and end deportations while offering work authorization to certain young undocumented immigrations appear aimed at re-energizing young and Latino voters. Can Obama win the necessary share of white voters? Certainly. After all, even Kerry and Dukakis matched or exceeded 40 percent of the white vote. Will Obama win the necessary share of the white vote? That is tougher to say, but two articles on RealClearPolitics by John Ellis and David Paul Kuhn contend that Obama stands beneath the threshold for national victory among white voters and that the outstanding white vote may deliver Romney the presidency. Although their basic calculus is accurate, they construct an unrepresentative and Romney-friendly picture by cherry-picking polls to fit their narrative. Depending on the exact non-white turnout and vote, Obama could require between 37 and 40 percent of the white vote to win a plurality of the national popular vote (in 2008, the magic number was 38.5 percent).*** David Paul Kuhn selects a relatively high but defensible threshold \u2014 39 percent \u2014 and asserts that Obama's floor among white voters has \"broken\" as recent polls show Obama holding between 37 and 38 percent of the white vote. But Kuhn only considers four polls, including two of the most favorable for Romney. Worse still, Ellis only focuses one poll: a Fox News poll showing Obama at just 35 percent of the white vote. An average of recent polls shows Obama holding 39 percent of white voters, enough to win reelection under the turnout scenario envisioned by the Obama campaign and enough for a tied election under Kuhn's scenario. Obama v. Romney: White Voters\n                \n                    \n                    tnr.com\n                    \n                \nhide caption Only the Fox News poll places Obama's support outside of the range where non-white voters could realistically put Obama over the top, but the same poll showed Obama's approval rating among white voters at 41 percent, suggesting that if the Fox poll had pushed undecided white voters to the same extent as other firms, Obama's standing among whites probably would reside in the toss-up range. There is no guarantee that Obama improves his standing among white voters, but two factors work in his favor: the inevitable break of some number of undecided voters toward Obama, and the equally inevitable break of some undecided voters toward their couch, which has the effect of boosting Obama's share of those whites who actually turn out and vote, compared to Obama's share of all registered white voters. On the other hand, the undecided are disproportionately working class voters who harbor deep reservations about Obama's performance. Romney has challenges of his own. No poll has pegged Romney near 60 percent of white voters \u2014 his own magic number under reasonable circumstances. The Obama campaign's expensive effort to cast Romney as a corporate plutocrat seems targeted at precisely these undecided white working class voters, and given that many of these voters have traditionally voted for Democrats in national elections, the attacks seem likely to resonate. Few would contend that Romney holds a special connection with white working class voters, and the danger for Romney is that many of these disaffected and dissatisfied voters simply might not turnout. With Obama all but assured an overwhelming share of the non-white vote, the Obama campaign has two tasks: capitalize on demographic changes by rekindling the enthusiasm of Obama's young and diverse coalition, and prevent Romney from assembling enough white voters to overcome. Regardless of whether the Obama campaign succeeds, there is no question that the Obama campaign's tactics are driven by these two imperatives. Indeed, most of the Obama campaign's early efforts fall into two corresponding categories: depicting Romney as a corporate raider and adopting policies enthusiastically supported by young and Latino voters. Obama wins reelection if Obama can prevent Romney from consolidating the undecided white vote, maintain his current share of the white vote, and capitalize on favorable demographic trends. Chicago knows it. ***Obama would require 40 percent of the white vote if minority turnout falls to 25 percent of the electorate and only 77 percent of minority voters support Obama. Obama would only require 37 percent of the white vote if the minority share of the electorate increases to 28 percent of the electorate, as foretold by the Obama campaign earlier this week, and 80 percent of non-white voters support Obama, as they did in 2008. The targets allow Obama to exceed 49.24 percent of the popular vote, which represented 50 percent of the two party vote in 2008.",

President Obama's new immigration policy is aimed at those who illegally came to this country as children and who've generally stayed out of trouble since they got here. These immigrants would get a temporary, two-year waiver from deportation, which could be extended. Plus, they would be eligible for a work permit. NPR's Scott Horsley explains the shift to Weekend Edition host Scott Simon: Who Does The New Policy Affect? \"The policy is aimed at people who came to the U.S. when they were under the age of 16 and who've lived here for at least five years, those who have gone to school or finished school or gotten their GED or served in the military and who are not yet 30 years old.\" Does It Substitute For Congressional Action? \"Mr. Obama is sensitive about appearing to be substituting his judgment for that of Congress. Instead, the administration's calling this an exercise of 'prosecutorial discretion' within the existing immigration laws. \"Mr. Obama described it as a stopgap measure while he tries to build support for a more comprehensive overhaul of immigration law. Some critics ... are not buying that, and they're accusing Mr. Obama of executive overreach.\" At the University of California, Los Angeles, Labor Center in downtown L.A., more than 100 student leaders from around the country hugged and cheered as President Obama delivered his immigration announcement Friday. Obama outlined a new policy to temporarily stop deporting some young illegal immigrants and make them eligible for work permits. Diego Sanchez was born in Argentina and brought to Miami 12 years ago. He's working on getting his MBA. He welcomed the president's announcement. \"It's a big step, a big relief for our communities, especially as students,\" Sanchez says. \"I'm not going to be thinking about what can happen if I get pulled over any more. Now you know that you can put your degree into work.\" Students like Sanchez have been working for years to get Congress to pass the DREAM Act, to grant conditional residency to young people like them \u2014 brought to the U.S. as children. With the DREAM Act stalled, an increasing number of so-called \"Dreamers\" have gone public with their legal dilemma. Cyndi Bendezu was born in Lima, Peru, and grew up in East L.A. She came here when she was 4 and has been undocumented for 23 years. She graduated from UCLA and is working on her master's degree at Columbia University. \"I know that we worked so hard for this, and I know Obama could do so much more,\" she says. \"But I know this is an election year, and I know that he needs our votes. So I know what this is about: It's politics.\" It's the politics \u2014 and timing \u2014 of Obama's announcement that has anti-immigrant groups riled up. Roy Beck, who heads the organization NumbersUSA, says Obama usurped power. \"[Congress] said no three times, and he goes, 'OK, I'll just do it on my own.' And he has stirred up a lot of new energy. Now he's made himself a huge target,\" Beck says. The president's announcement also sparked much debate on the airwaves around the country. California Assemblyman Tim Donnelly, a Republican, spoke out against the policy on NPR member station KPCC. \"I think this just is a cynical ploy to try to pander to illegals in order to somehow get votes,\" he said. \"The problem is he's doing this at the expense of our kids who are out there looking for work right now.\" Some of the students who could benefit from Obama's order remain skeptical about how it will be enforced. Mexican-born high school student Jahel Campos was among a half-dozen others staging a weeklong sit-in outside Obama's campaign headquarters in Culver City. She says the president's order doesn't go far enough. \"We want the executive order which is going to stop all of the deportations. I'm more worried about my parents. I'm not worried about myself,\" Campos says. But for students like Bendezu, who hopes to earn her Ph.D. in political science, Obama's words brought validation, at least for now. \"We are the future of this country, and they need us. And our parents taught us that. And our parents have struggled and they've sacrificed everything,\" she says. \"It's finally time for them to realize we're human and we have feelings. Because it's so inhumane how they treat us like we don't exist. And we do.\"",

Like she did earlier today, Napolitano characterized this move as prioritizing. \"What we're doing is saying, 'Look when we enforce the immigration law, we want to focus on those who have violated the criminal laws in addition to immigration law, who are repeat violators or are people we catch right at the border,\" she said. Audie asked Napolitano to respond to critics who have said with this policy shift, the Obama administration is essentially bypassing Congress. Napolitano said this doesn't take the place of legislation. \"This is not the same as the Dream Act, because there is no pathway to citizenship.There's no pathway to permanent legal residency. It's deferral of removal action,\" she said. And it's something the U.S. has done before, she said.

As NPR's Corey Dade wrote earlier this week on It's All Politics, previously supportive groups have been highly critical in recent weeks of what they see as up-to-now a failed effort by the administration to reduce the deportations of otherwise law-abiding illegal immigrants. Update at 4:48 p.m. ET. Romney Statement: The Romney campaign has now issued a statement. It reads in part: \"I'd like to see legislation that deals with this issue, and I happen to agree with Marco Rubio as he looked at this issue. He said that this is an important matter, that we have to find a long-term solution, but that the president's action makes reaching a long-term solution more difficult. If I'm president, we'll do our very best to have that kind of long-term solution that provides certainty and clarity for the people who come into this country through no fault of their own by virtue of the action of their parents.\" Rubio issued a statement earlier today, saying that while there is broad agreement that this issue needs to be resolved, this move by Obama \" will make harder to achieve in the long run.\" Update at 4:07 p.m. ET. Romney Says This Is Not The Way To Go: NPR's Evie Stone, who's traveling with the Romney campaign, tells us that Romney has responded to Obama's move. \"Romney said something has to be done about young people who came to the country through no fault of their own,\" Evie reports. \"but this is not the way to do it because it's short term.\" Update at 3:25 p.m. ET. On The Politics: NPR's Liz Halloran talked to Darry Sragow, a lawyer and longtime Democratic strategist based in Los Angeles. Sragow said this move puts the Romney camp in a difficult position. Sragow said: \"Romney's got to make a choice,\" Sragow says. \"His base is not going to like what the president just did. But he can't win in November by tacking hard to the right. The Romney campaign is going to have to sit there with a calculator and consider the costs and benefits of throwing a bone to the Republican base.\" Update at 3:18 p.m. ET. Obama Interrupted: Just a quick note that we've added a post talking about the reporter who interrupted President Obama. Update at 2:16 p.m. ET. Obama Says 'It's The Right To Do': During a statement in the Rose Garden, President Obama said taking this step is simply \"the right thing to do.\" \"It's the right thing to do for our economy; it's the right thing to do for our security, and it's the right thing to do period,\" the president said. President Obama said that this is not \"amnesty\" and not \"immunity.\" \"This is a temporary stop gap measure that helps us focus our resources wisely,\" said Obama. \"Precisely because this is temporary, Congress needs to act.\" At one point, Obama asked Americans to put themselves in the shoes of young illegal immigrants. He asked them to imagine doing everything right \u2014 going to school, graduating \u2014 only to face the threat of deportation. \"They are Americans in their hearts, in their minds, in every way but one,\" he said. Update at 12:59 p.m. ET. A Big Step, But Not Permanent: \"This is a bold step that shows leadership by President Obama,\" Laura Vazquez, of the National Council of La Raza, tells our Newscast unit. Vazquez said the move provides immediate relief \"and lifts a cloud from the young people who are here; they're contributing to their communities; they're American in every sense of the word and now they can continue their contribution without the fear of immediate deportation.\" But Vazquez says NCLR will continue pushing for immigration reform, mainly the Dream Act, which would extend permanent residency to young immigrants. \"This is a huge step,\" Vazquez said. \"But we certainly know this is not a permanent solution.\" Update at 12:25 p.m. ET. Precedent Is 'Troubling': Israel Ortega of the Heritage Foundation, a conservative think tank in Washington, says his first concern about this announcement is \"for the president's penchant for going around the legislative process.\" \"In many ways this is the president going around [Congress] because he didn't get his way a couple of years ago with the Dream Act,\" Ortega told our Newscast unit. \"So the precedent that this continues to set on immigration is troubling.\" Ortega also called this a political move on Obama's part. \"This is obviously a move to shore up the Latino, Hispanic support for the election,\" Ortega said. \"He knows that he continues to be the president who has deported the most number of immigrants in this country so this is a move to kind of stymie that argument.\" Update at 11:46 a.m. ET. U.S. 'Lives Up To Its Ideals': Jose Antonio Vargas, the former The Washington Post reporter who made a splash last year after he \"came out\" as an undocumented immigrant in a piece for The New York Times. Since then he started a project called Define American with hopes that other illegal immigrants would share their stories. In a blog post, today, Vargas wrote: \"Today our country embraces upwards of one million young new Americans: DREAMers. \"They grew up here, they were educated here and they have so much to give back to the country they call home. With a stroke of President Obama's pen, our country lives up to its ideals and finds a fair and pragmatic solution, ending the nightmare of a generation of young people who are Americans in all but documents.\" Vargas came to the United States as a child. On Twitter, he said that this executive action does not apply to him. He is 31. Update at 11:35 a.m. ET. Does Not Replace Legislation: NPR's Liz Halloran tells us that after Napolitano gave her on-the-record statement, two unnamed \"senior administration officials\" answered questions from reporters. Liz reports: \"Perhaps the most salient query: Why would these young people come forward and present themselves to the government without a guarantee of a work permit, and with the uncertainty of who may be occupying the White House come November? What would happen under a Romney administration? \"The officials acknowledged that Friday's DHS action falls under the executive decision-making purview of the president, and that the executive branch can always change its mind on prosecutorial discretion. \"'This doesn't alleviate the need for legislation,' an official said. 'We need Congress to act to provide a pathway for these people. We're saying it doesn't not make any sense to spend resources on these people.' \"'Deferred action is available for two years. We don't consider it a permanent solution,' an official said. So, again, another reporter asked, why would they come forward? \"Because they want to work,\" an official replied, noting that the DHS should not be viewed as encouraging people to come forward, just as \"making a process available.\" When pressed about how state immigration laws, including the tough Arizona measures now under high court review, would affect the federal policy, the officials were pointed. \"The federal government alone makes the decision on who to remove,\" the official said. \"Nothing in any state law is going to impact this announcement\" or its enforcement. Update at 11:15 a.m. ET. \"It Is Not Immunity, It Is Not Amnesty,\" Napolitano Says. NPR.org's Liz Halloran passes along some of what Napolitano had to say during the conference call with reporters: -- The changes will allow DHS to concentrate immigration enforcement resources on those in the country illegally who are a \"danger to national security or a risk to public safety,\" she said, and not on \"productive young people,\" many of whom \"have already contributed to our country in significant ways.\" -- Deferring immigration enforcement action for young people who are low enforcement priorities, Napolitano said, does not provide any individual with permanent lawful status. \"It is not immunity, it is not amnesty. It is an exercise of discretion\" that will streamline immigration enforcement and ease the burden on immigration courts, she said. -- The procedures outlined by the DHS would allow those who seek out and are granted deferred action to apply for permits that would allow them to work legally. The administration estimates that about 800,000 young people may be eligible for deferred action. Update at 10:45 a.m. ET. It's The DREAM Act: As the Miami Herald's Naked Politics blog points out, \"in yet another sign that Hispanics are key in presidential politics, President Barack Obama's ... will stop deporting and grant work permits to nearly 1 million immigrants who entered or remained in the United States illegally as children and would be eligible for the DREAM Act, which is stalled in Congress amid election-year gridlock and competing proposals.\" Update at 10:10 a.m. ET. Obama To Speak: The White House says the president will have some things to say about this news at 1:15 p.m. ET. Update at 10 a.m. ET. Confirmed: The White House just sent reporters a statement saying, in part: \"Secretary of Homeland Security Janet Napolitano today announced that effective immediately, certain young people who were brought to the United States as young children, do not present a risk to national security or public safety, and meet several key criteria will be considered for relief from removal from the country or from entering into removal proceedings. Those who demonstrate that they meet the criteria will be eligible to receive deferred action for a period of two years, subject to renewal, and will be eligible to apply for work authorization. ... \"Under this directive, individuals who demonstrate that they meet the following criteria will be eligible for an exercise of discretion, specifically deferred action, on a case-by-case basis: \"1. Came to the United States under the age of 16; \"2. Have continuously resided in the United States for a least five years preceding the date of this memorandum and are present in the United States on the date of this memorandum; \"3. Are currently in school, have graduated from high school, have obtained a general education development certificate, or are honorably discharged veterans of the Coast Guard or Armed Forces of the United States; \"4. Have not been convicted of a felony offense, a significant misdemeanor offense, multiple misdemeanor offenses, or otherwise pose a threat to national security or public safety; \"5. Are not above the age of 30. ... \"While this guidance takes effect immediately, USCIS and ICE expect to begin implementation of the application processes within 60 days. In the meantime, individuals seeking more information on the new policy should visit USCIS's website (at www.uscis.gov), ICE's website (at www.ice.gov), or DHS's website (at www.dhs.gov). Beginning Monday, individuals can also call USCIS' hotline at 1-800-375-5283 or ICE's hotline at 1-888-351-4024 during business hours with questions or to request more information on the forthcoming process.\"",

Union City is one of the state's largest cities, and has a Hispanic population of more than 80 percent. The U.S. Supreme Court's expected ruling in June on Arizona's immigration law will set the blueprint for states where many officials say they face a crisis in trying to crack down on rising numbers of illegal residents. Yet population changes and various research indicate that the great flow primarily of Latino illegal immigrants, which lasted at least two decades, ended several years ago. A funny thing happened on the way to Latinos becoming America's largest minority: Their population growth significantly slowed, so much so that many demographers estimate the boom peaked between 2005 and 2006. By 2010, the majority of Latinos living in America were born here. And Mexican immigration, which contributed the overwhelming majority of illegal entries, has come to a halt. Policy Debate As the migration surge ebbed, the political debate over illegal immigration actually intensified. Several states have drafted or passed legislation modeled after Arizona's, enacted in 2010, causing a political firestorm and a wave of legal challenges. Controversy over the laws has entered the presidential election. Do these trends mean America no longer needs to corral illegal immigration? Renowned demographer William H. Frey, of the Brookings Institution, told The Associated Press that \"the concerns, especially about low-skilled and undocumented Hispanic immigration, represent issues that could well be behind us.\" Others aren't at all convinced. \"I don't know that policy has ever been responsive to data,\" says Princeton University sociologist Marta Tienda. \"It's discouraging to see that good data does not make it into the policy process because sometimes the policy is driven by politics.\" I don't know that policy has ever been responsive to data. Marta Tienda, Princeton University sociologist Tienda is among those whose research years ago predicted these population changes, including the census report released Thursday showing that nonwhite babies now make up a majority of U.S. births. Researchers agree that no one factor contributed to the slowed immigration. The recession and high unemployment have discouraged migrants, as has heightened border enforcement, a record number of deportations during the Obama administration and a strengthened Mexican economy. Advocates of stricter immigration enforcement say the slowed immigration presents a false sense of security. When the U.S. economy eventually bounces back, illegal immigrants again will be attracted by jobs as \"powerful magnets,\" says Bob Dane, a spokesman at the Federation for American Immigration Reform, which opposes amnesty and favors tougher enforcement of existing laws. \"It proves that illegal immigration is a controllable phenomenon,\" Dane says. \"You control it by drying up the jobs magnet.\"",

Read Another Opinion On The 2012 Presidential Election Ben Adler is a writer for The Nation. It doesn't take a political science PhD to figure out what Mitt Romney needs to do if he is to have a chance of winning the presidency in November. He must reduce the dramatic margins by which President Obama won among certain key constituencies in 2008, specifically women, Latinos and young voters. Romney has recently launched his efforts to do just that. The week before last he had sought to lambast Obama for job losses among women. That message got muddied as Romney evaded questions about whether he supported the Lily Ledbetter Fair Pay Act. By comparison Romney's focus last week \u2014 multiple attacks on Obama's economic record aimed at Latinos and young people \u2014 went off without a hitch. But do they have any chance of working? The predominant focus for Romney of late has been the youth vote. He sent at least seven missives on the topic last week. Of course he won't win the youth vote outright. But, as Jennifer Rubin of the Washington Post noted, Romney doesn't have to win the youth vote, he merely has to reduce Obama's margins of victory among them. A small enough margin will be offset by Romney's near-certain advantage among the elderly. And, the elderly vote in far greater numbers than young people. As Elsepth Reeve of The Atlantic Wire points out, the supposedly massive youth turnout of 2008 was not the highest in history. It will probably be lower this year. But Reeve is over-simplifying when she writes, \"Aside from the fact that hardly any young people show up, they're so heavily Democratic it seems pointless for Romney to try to fight for them.\" The reason so many pundits have inaccurately referred to a supposedly record youth turnout in 2008 is because the youth vote was far more Democratic than in previous cycles. Obama's 66 percent of voters under 30 years old represented an unprecedented degree of party polarization by age. That allowed young voters to affect the outcome far more than they usually do. Obama must repeat that feat if he is to win. That won't be easy. On Tuesday the Institute of Politics at Harvard's Kennedy School of Government released a major poll of Americans ages 18 to 29. Overall, it should be encouraging to Obama. He led Romney 43 percent to 26 percent, with the remainder undecided. But there are three possible subgroups of young voters among whom Romney could make inroads: whites, Latinos, and voters under 21 years old. \"There's opportunity for Romney among segments of youth vote where Obama's underperforming compared to four years ago,\" notes John Della Volpe, the IOP's director of polling. \"Almost seven out of ten young whites are not committed to Obama. He won young whites by ten points last time, now it's roughly one-third each [for Obama, Romney and undecided].\" Romney actually leads Obama 37 to 34 percent in the poll. But the greater diversity of the Millennial generation gives Obama an advantage. Only 58 percent of respondents in the IOP's poll are non-Hispanic white. Among the 21 percent who are Hispanic and the 12 percent who are non-Hispanic African-American, Obama leads by wide margins: 50 percent to 12 percent and 79 percent to 1 percent, respectively. But there may be a glimmer of hope for Romney among young Latinos. When Obama took office, his approval rating among young Latinos, 81 percent, was virtually the same as his 84 percent approval rating among young African-Americans. Since then the two have diverged. While Obama has never dropped below 82 percent approval among young African-Americans, his approval rating among young Latinos tumbled to 52 percent last year, although it is now back up at 66 percent. By some other measures of an incumbent president's strength, young Latinos more closely resemble young whites than young African-Americans. For example, the IOP poll notes, \"40 percent of Blacks say things in the nation are headed in the right direction \u2014 which is signi\ufb01cantly higher than the percentage of Whites (16%) and Hispanics (21%) who say the same.\" Part of the problem for Romney, though, may be that one reason young Latinos are disappointed in Obama, and the direction of the country, is that Obama failed to deliver comprehensive immigration reform \u2014 and the Republican Party demonizes undocumented immigrants. If so, the best Romney can hope for is that those voters stay home. If they do come out, they will surely see Obama as the lesser evil than Romney, who supports draconian anti\u2013illegal immigration measures, such as Arizona's controversial SB 1070 law. The last group that offers Romney some small possibility of cutting into Obama's margins is the youngest of young voters. People who are under 21 were too young to vote in the last election, so they aren't already committed to Obama. And having come of age in such a slow economy \u2014 rather than during George W. Bush's economic crisis and unpopular Iraq War \u2014 may make them less grateful to Obama for withdrawing from Iraq and more open to Romney's economic message. Obama leads among 18- to 24-year-olds by 12 points (41 percent to 29 percent) and among 25- to 29-year-olds by 23 points (46 percent to 23 percent). Romney knows that the economy is his only angle among young voters. He isn't going to win them over with his opposition to access for contraception. And a generation that was shaped by 9/11 is unlikely to buy the idea that President Obama, Osama bin Laden's executioner, has been unsuccessful on foreign policy. So Romey has rolled out his youth appeal with a purely economic focus. He has blasted out press releases and organized conference calls with headlines such as \"The Effect Of President Obama's Failed Economic Policies On Young Adults.\" Surrogates, such as 30-year-old Representative Aaron Schock (R-IL) and College Republican President Alex Schriver, say Obama has failed young people in two major ways: he hasn't put enough of them back to work and he has saddled their generation with increased federal debt. The latter point, of course, is absurd. Very little of the current debt is attributable to Obama's policies. Anyone who takes office during an economic contraction will see deficit-spending rise on their watch because tax revenues will decline and automatic spending on programs such as food stamps will increase. But the former argument \u2014 that Obama has presided over unacceptably high unemployment among young people \u2014 could have some political resonance. As part of his focus on economic hardship Romney has taken a rare position in agreement with Obama: both favor continuing a law to lower student loan interest rates. The rub, though, is how to pay for it, which House Republicans want to do by defunding a portion of the Affordable Care Act. This has understandably prompted a veto threat from the White House. Democrats are trying to fend off Romney's incursion into their youth vote turf. The Democratic National Committee dismissed Romney's student loan stance as \"shameless lip service.\" The Republican Congressional budget, which Romney supports, would slash funding for Pell grants, thus making college even more unaffordable. Repealing the Affordable Care Act, as Romney pledges to do, would force millions of young people to lose their health insurance. Romney seems to believe that he can substitute a general argument that youth unemployment is too high under Obama for specific policies that would help young people. For example, Romney is targeting a subset of young people, military veterans, with press releases such as one he released Friday titled \"Veterans Are Struggling in the Obama Economy.\" True enough, although the White House has launched a program to improve veterans' employment, which Romney has praised. Obama also has a program in the Housing and Urban Development (HUD) Department to combat veterans' homelessness. Romney recently suggestedabolishing HUD, which presumably means eliminating that program. Romney, as Think Progress points out, has no policy agenda on veterans issues. Meanwhile both Romney and Obama set off to visit college campuses last week. The differing receptions \u2014 enthusiasm for Obama and literally dozing off during Romney's speech \u2014 were memorably captured by a TPM video mashing up the two. Ultimately the Republicans' nominal acceptance of lower student loan interest rates is just election-year politics. Their real view on college affordability is best expressed by Romney's exhortations to young people to find cheaper colleges, conservative economist Josh Barro's complaint that colleges should reduce costs on their own, and the declaration of House Higher Education subcommittee Chair Virginia Foxx (R-NC) that,\"I have very little tolerance for people who tell me that they graduate with $200,000 of debt or even $80,000 of debt because there's no reason for that.\" If Democrats make young people understand that, Romney will have a very hard time making inroads among young voters.",

Ron Paul, R-Texas, greets supporters in Ankeny, Iowa after his third-place finish in the Iowa caucus. \n                \n                    \n                    Mark Kegans/Getty Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption Republican presidential candidate, U.S. Rep. Ron Paul, R-Texas, greets supporters in Ankeny, Iowa after his third-place finish in the Iowa caucus. Read Another Opinion On Ron Paul Katha Pollitt is a columnist for The Nation. What is it with progressive mancrushes on right-wing Republicans? For years, until he actually got nominated, John McCain was the recipient of lefty smooches equaled only by those bestowed upon Barack Obama before he had to start governing. You might disagree with what McCain stood for, went the argument, but he had integrity, and charisma, and some shiny mavericky positions \u2014 on campaign finance reform and gun control and... well, those two anyway. Now Ron Paul is getting the love. At Truthdig, Robert Scheer calls him \"a profound and principled contributor to a much-needed national debate on the limits of federal power.\" In The Nation, John Nichols praises his \"pure conservatism,\" \"values\" and \"principle.\" Salon's Glenn Greenwald is so outraged that progressives haven't abandoned the warmongering, drone-sending, indefinite-detention-supporting Obama for Paul that he accuses them of supporting the murder of Muslim children. There's a Paul fan base in the Occupy movement and at Counterpunch, where Alexander Cockburn is a longtime admirer. Paul is a regular guest of Jon Stewart, who has yet to ask him a tough question. And yes, these are all white men; if there are leftish white women and people of color who admire Paul, they're keeping pretty quiet. Ron Paul has an advantage over most of his fellow Republicans in having an actual worldview, instead of merely a set of interests \u2014 he opposes almost every power the federal government has and almost everything it does. Given Washington's enormous reach, it stands to reason that progressives would find targets to like in Paul's wholesale assault. I, too, would love to see the end of the \"war on drugs\" and our other wars. I, too, am shocked by the curtailment of civil liberties in pursuit of the \"war on terror,\" most recently the provision in the NDAA permitting the indefinite detention, without charge, of U.S. citizens suspected of involvement in terrorism. But these are a handful of cherries on a blighted tree. In a Ron Paul America, there would be no environmental protection, no Social Security, no Medicaid or Medicare, no help for the poor, no public education, no civil rights laws, no anti-discrimination law, no Americans With Disabilities Act, no laws ensuring the safety of food or drugs or consumer products, no workers' rights. How far does Paul take his war against Washington? He wants to abolish the Federal Aviation Authority and its pesky air traffic controllers. He has one magic answer to every problem \u2014 including how to land an airplane safely: let the market handle it. It's a little strange to see people who inveigh against Obama's healthcare compromises wave away, as a detail, Paul's opposition to any government involvement in healthcare. In Ron Paul's America, if you weren't prudent enough or wealthy enough to buy private insurance \u2014 and the exact policy that covers what's ailing you now \u2014 you find a charity or die. And if civil liberties are so important, how can Paul's progressive fans overlook his opposition to abortion and his signing of the personhood pledge, which could ban many birth control methods? Last time I checked, women were half the population (the less important half, apparently). Technically, Paul would overturn Roe and let states make their own laws regulating women's bodies, up to and including prosecuting abortion as murder. Add in his opposition to basic civil rights law \u2014 he maintains his opposition to the 1964 Civil Rights Act and opposes restrictions on the \"freedom\" of business owners to refuse service to blacks \u2014 and his hostility to the federal government starts looking more and more like old-fashioned Southern-style states' rights. No wonder they love him over at Stormfront, a white-supremacist website with neo-Nazi tendencies. In a multiple-choice poll of possible effects of a Paul presidency, the most popular answer by far was \"Paul will implement reforms that increase liberty which will indirectly benefit White Nationalists.\" And let's not forget his other unsavory fan base, Christian extremists who want to execute gays, adulterers and \"insubordinate children.\" Paul's many connections with the Reconstructionist movement, going back decades, are laid out on AlterNet by Adele Stan, who sees him as a faux libertarian whose real agenda is not individualism but to prevent the federal government from restraining the darker impulses at work at the state and local levels. It's all pretty incoherent for a man often praised as principled and consistent and profound \u2014 if states could turn themselves into a Christian theocracy, could they also turn themselves into socialist mini-republics? If they can ban contraception, can they also compel contraception? For people who see Paul as an antiwar candidate who will restore the Bill of Rights, it's almost bad manners to bring up his opposition to just about every piece of progressive legislation passed in the last 200 years, from the Occupational Safety and Health Act and membership in the UN to Federal Deposit Insurance and requirements that undocumented immigrants be permitted treatment in ERs. But come on! This man has been a stone reactionary his entire life. Consistent? Not to harp on abortion, but an effective ban would require a level of policing that would make the war on drugs look feeble. If Ron Paul was interested in peace, he wouldn't be a Republican \u2014 that party has even more enthusiasm for the military-industrial complex than the Democrats. For decades the GOP has turned every election into a contest over who is more macho, more nationalistic, more willing to do exactly the things lefty Paul fans excoriate Obama for doing. Paul doesn't get re-elected in his Texas district because of boutique positions like thinking Osama bin Laden should have been arrested, not assassinated. Supporting Ralph Nader in 2000 was at least a vote for one's actual politics. Supporting Ron Paul is just a gesture of frivolity \u2014 or despair.",

She is one of an estimated 1.7 million mostly Afghan refugees in Pakistan.\n                \n                    \n                    Muhammed Muheisen/AP\n                    \n                \nhide caption An Afghan refugee girl walks back to her home in a slum on the outskirts of the Pakistani capital, Islamabad, in August. She is one of an estimated 1.7 million mostly Afghan refugees in Pakistan. Burhan Khan can't remember exactly when he fled from Afghanistan to Pakistan. He thinks it was about 30 years ago. \"Because there was war. There was killing, there was murdering, there was firing, and they wanted to kill me, and they wanted to kill my children, so I had to come here,\" he says. It was the final phase of the Cold War, and CIA-armed Afghan guerrillas were fighting to drive the Soviets out of Afghanistan. One of the biggest mistakes that Pakistan made in the past is that it saw somehow a Pashtun solution to Afghanistan, whereas now it sees an Afghan solution to Afghanistan. Maleeha Lodhi, a former Pakistani ambassador to Washington Khan and his family wound up where they are today, in a mud hovel on a patch of wasteland outside Pakistan's capital, Islamabad. Khan is 60, though his full white beard and deeply lined face make him look a lot older. He survives by hauling vegetables in a market. He has never returned to his home, in northern Afghanistan's Kunduz province. He feels it's still too dangerous to try. \"We can't go there because if we go, we will die there, our children will be killed; everybody is still killing us there,\" Khan says. Each big new conflict in Afghanistan over the past three decades has unleashed a wave of refugees, many of whom have returned home. Yet Pakistan still has some 1.7 million refugees \u2014 mostly Afghans \u2014 on its soil. Pakistanis fear another wave will arrive because of the fallout after 2014 from the drawdown of U.S. and NATO forces. There is widespread concern the drawdown will be followed by a civil war in Afghanistan that will spill over into Pakistan, causing more violence in an already unstable nation. Leading Pakistani analysts say that prospect has led their country's policymakers to change tactics toward its neighbor. External And Internal Threats Pervez Hoodbhoy, a leading Pakistani political activist and commentator, says he thinks civil war in Afghanistan is \"almost a certainty\" after the departure of the international troops. He wants U.S. forces to leave Afghanistan but says their withdrawal should be gradual. Even so, Hoodbhoy is very worried about what happens next. \"It's going to be ugly, bloody, and no one is looking forward to 2014, except for the Taliban,\" he says. Pakistan is going through a particularly rocky period in its turbulent history. The economy is in crisis. Conflict between Pakistani government forces and homegrown Islamist insurgents, including the Pakistani Taliban, has claimed tens of thousands of lives. Afghan refugees collect water from a water point in a slum area on the outskirts of Islamabad, in May.\n                \n                    \n                    Muhammed Muheisen/AP\n                    \n                \nhide caption Hoodbhoy believes if he's right \u2014 and there is an Afghan civil war \u2014 refugees won't be the only threat to Pakistan. \"We will see the Taliban will become much bolder,\" he says. \"There will be a feeling among Islamist forces in this country, and not just the Taliban, that with the Americans now out of here, it is now time for an Islamic revolution in Pakistan.\" Fear that they'll soon face another bout of chaos and bloodshed is preying heavily on the minds of Pakistan's rulers. A Shift In Policy Pakistan's military and intelligence services determine the country's Afghan policy. And some analysts see a significant shift in that policy, brought about by Pakistan's desire to avoid more instability and violence. \"I think Pakistan has learned its lesson,\" says Tariq Fatemi, a former Pakistani ambassador to Washington. \"It recognizes that in Afghanistan peace can prevail only where there is power sharing among the various ethnic groups.\" Fatemi says he has spoken to many people in key positions, who tell him \"that they now recognize that these ambitious plans of wanting to determine Afghanistan's destiny was not only a failed policy, but was a policy that caused us immense harm.\" That policy is linked to Pakistan's constant worry about being sandwiched between two hostile countries. Its old enemy, India, lies to the east. So for years, Pakistan sought to influence events in Afghanistan, to the west, by supporting its majority ethnic group, the Pashtuns. Afghan refugee Hamesha Gul, 59, reads from the Quran after early-morning prayer in a mosque in an Islamabad slum in August.\n                \n                    \n                    Muhammed Muheisen/AP\n                    \n                \nhide caption Afghan refugee Hamesha Gul, 59, reads from the Quran after early-morning prayer in a mosque in an Islamabad slum in August. Pakistan helped the Taliban come to power in the mid-1990s. In recent years, Islamabad has often been accused of covertly supporting certain Pashtun militant groups, including the Taliban and the Haqqani network. With its own large population of Pashtuns, Pakistan has worked on the assumption that a Pashtun-run Afghanistan would be friendly and, it hoped, compliant. Maleeha Lodhi, also a former Pakistani ambassador to Washington, says that's all changed. \"One of the biggest mistakes that Pakistan made in the past is that it saw somehow a Pashtun solution to Afghanistan, whereas now it sees an Afghan solution to Afghanistan,\" Lodhi says. She says Pakistan no longer talks about seeking a friendly government in Kabul, just a stable one. \"If any group is excluded from power then there will be trouble in Afghanistan. That is the lesson from history that Pakistan has learned,\" she says. Deep Divisions Remain But have Pakistan's policymakers really learned that lesson? Zahid Hussain has written several books about Pakistan and Islamist militancy. He is convinced that Pakistan's military fully signed on to the new Afghan policy a while back. \"It cannot be a policy without the approval of the Pakistani military establishment,\" he says. \"I think there is complete unanimity on that.\" Pakistan's military and intelligence establishment is highly secretive, and it's hard for outsiders to know what's going on within it. Hoodbhoy, the analyst, points to deep internal divisions. \"The army is torn from within,\" he says. \"There is a party which is seriously at war with one part of the Taliban. On the other hand, there is a substantial group which aspires to right-wing Islamist ideology.\" Still, those seeking to forge peace in Afghanistan will surely welcome Pakistan's apparent new approach. Everyone knows, though, that it won't necessarily avert disaster. There are so many unanswered questions: What if Afghanistan's presidential elections, slated for spring 2014, end in turmoil? Will an Afghan peace process ever get off the ground? Deep distrust prevails between Afghanistan's ethnic groups. Back in his mud hovel, Burhan Khan, the Afghan refugee, is unsure whether there will ever be peace back home \u2014 or if he'll ever be able to return. Everyone back home knows one another; everyone remembers who supported whom in Afghanistan's wars, he explains. And that means there are many unsettled scores.",

            "article_content": "The aftermath of Superstorm Sandy has complicated voting in the New York City area. Robert Siegel talks with Robert Smith.  ROBERT SIEGEL, HOST: Of course, the polls will remain open for a couple of hours yet in New York State. But in New York, this election has proved especially surprising because of Sandy, the storm. NPR's Robert Smith is on Staten Island, the borough of New York City that was most damaged. And, Robert, are they managing to pull off an Election Day despite the terrible damage of the storm there? ROBERT SMITH, BYLINE: Well, it all depends on what you mean by pull off. You know, here in New York City, they always have something go wrong in elections. But I'll tell you right now, I am in a neighborhood that is completely black. It is darkness. There is no electricity. It is block after block of homes with no lights on. And right in the middle is a tent lit by these huge, bright Klieg lights. That is the polling place. There's no heat. There's barely any electricity inside. But they are open until 9 o'clock tonight. They haven't seen too many people today. They said it's gone smoothly. But all over the city we're hearing about delays, people don't know where to go. There's all sorts of problems here in New York. SIEGEL: But are there actually voters there right now who are waiting to vote? SMITH: Yeah. This particular polling place, it's been light traffic. A lot of people have left this neighborhood. And in fact, Governor Cuomo here in New York signed a proclamation that says anyone can vote anywhere they want in the state with a provisional ballot. They just need to go to a polling place. Which is great, you know, if you're a refugee and you have left your neighborhood. But it also makes things very difficult here. I mean, it has made lines long all over the city and it's going to make things difficult as they have to verify those votes. So, luckily here, it's not just a state that's really in play for the presidential election, because they're going to be sorting this out for a long time. SIEGEL: OK. Sounds like a very complicated and difficult Election Day on Staten Island. NPR's Robert Smith, thank you. SMITH: You're welcome. Copyright \u00a9 2012 NPR.  All rights reserved.

            "article_content": "On this Election Day, people in New York are casting their ballots even though many still don't have power \u2014 or even homes to return to. Some polling stations are struggling to get reliable power.  RENEE MONTAGNE, HOST: This is MORNING EDITION from NPR News. I'm Renee Montagne. STEVE INSKEEP, HOST: And I'm Steve Inskeep. The triumph in some parts of the country this morning is that people are able to vote at all. Just over a week after Hurricane Sandy slammed ashore, people are voting today in New Jersey. And in New York City, NPR's Robert Smith is in the Borough of Queens, part of New York City. He's on the line. Robert, what have you seen today? ROBERT SMITH, BYLINE: Well, I'm actually in Rockaway Beach. And I'm at one of the few operating polling centers here. And it is sort of amazing. One poll worker described it as looking like a refugee camp. There's a giant tent. There are no lights on inside the tent so it's very dim. It's very hard to see. And in fact I can poke my head in right now because there's holes in the tent, and I can see people voting at these machines. The only glow is the light of the electronic machines. They're filling out their forms and scanning them. And from early, early, early this morning, people were lined up to vote in what are very, very difficult conditions. There's no heat here. There's no light. The floor is covered with dirt from when the ocean had washed over this area. But people are coping well with it. INSKEEP: Well, you said Rockaway Beach. This is one of the most exposed parts of the Borough of Queens. And when you say refugee camp, it must feel that way to a lot of people because they have had so many basic services taken away. SMITH: Oh, absolutely. I mean the people I spoke to this morning, at 6:00 a.m., when this polling place opened - and I should say there were troubles getting this place open. There was no fuel for the generators, but people waited patiently in line. And they told me that one of the reasons they got there this early is because they have no heat in their buildings. No heat, no light, and they thought, well, if I'm going to do anything, I might as well vote. I talked to one voter. His name is Isaiah Donaldson and he said he just decided he was going to get up early and come out. ISAIAH DONALDSON: I got up. I walked through the dark and made sure I voted. Being out here has been very stressful, being that there's no light. So things have been very hectic, but hopefully as the day goes by, it will gradually get better. INSKEEP: Given everything, Robert Smith, do people seem enthused about voting? SMITH: Absolutely. The people who have shown up, I mean they - they wouldn't let anything stop them. I will say I talked to a lot of people this morning who said there's no way they're voting. They just have too much to deal with. I talked to three guys. They were trying to get a car off of a low concrete wall where the waves had washed it up there. And they looked at me like I was crazy when I asked them if they were going to vote. They said, listen, we have spend every daylight hour trying to clean up around here. And you know, the presidential election will have to go on without us. INSKEEP: Well, let me ask about that because you are in a state that is expected to go for President Obama, just as other states are expected to go very heavily for Mitt Romney. Those people who do vote, do they feel that their vote is making a difference in any way today? SMITH: I think that they feel that just showing up is making a difference. No, I mean President Obama is going to win this district. Talking to people that I've talked to, he's going to win this state fairly easily. There are some close local races, but people weren't out for that. They were just out to vote for the presidential race. They've been following it. They finally wanted to do it and they weren't going to let any sort of disaster stop them. INSKEEP: And we should mention, for people who were not in swing states, that even though the popular vote is not decisive, we learn what it is - it matters. It is in that sense part of the results.

            "article_content": "Superstorm Sandy is interfering with planning for Election Day in New York and New Jersey. Though neither of the reliably Democratic states is expected to decide the presidential election, authorities are trying to find ways for millions of voters to cast ballots.  RENEE MONTAGNE, HOST: Along with other post-Hurricane Sandy reconstruction, New York and New Jersey are trying to reassemble their election preparations. The storm affected hundreds of polling stations. Neither of these reliably Democratic states was poised to decide the presidential election, but public officials are still scrambling to make voting possible for millions of people in the evacuation zones. NPR's Quil Lawrence reports. QUIL LAWRENCE, BYLINE: The office of the Board of Elections for Manhattan is on the West Side, about 30 blocks south of the nearest functioning traffic light on the island. Like most of the neighborhood, the government building is dark. The only workers in sight were taking down some scaffolding battered by the storm. LEE SULLIVAN: The water here on Houston came to Greenwich Street. You could see the, you know, old scrungy bits of cardboard. LAWRENCE: Lee Sullivan works as an estimator for a construction company across the street. She walks to the office most days. She was also planning to walk to the polls on Tuesday. SULLIVAN: I vote at the Westbeth location, which was flooded. That building was completely flooded, their basement. LAWRENCE: Sullivan says she knows about construction, and that polling station isn't going to be ready in five days. SULLIVAN: I'm a supporter of Obama myself, and you have a nice bloc of Democratic voters here in the city, and I don't want my vote to be lost. LAWRENCE: Obama has nearly a 30-point lead in New York, so Sullivan's vote wasn't going to swing the election. New Jersey is also solid-blue in the polls. But officials still want to see Tuesday go smoothly. J.C. Polanco is a commissioner at the New York City Board of Elections. He said efforts began before the storm hit. J.C. POLANCO: As soon as the mayor alerted the city to what was coming, we were able to get in there and secure all of the new electronic voting machines and bring them into the Staten Island armory. LAWRENCE: Polanco says more than 300 staff have been assessing the damage, sometimes with NYPD escorts. New York does not have voting by mail, but the deadline for getting an absentee ballot has been extended through today. At least a hundred polling stations in New York City are inside evacuation zones. Some of them are schools, now full of storm refugees. Polanco said heated tents might go up outside those stations. New Jersey Secretary of State Kim Guadagno said citizens in shelters could register to vote by mail, and that voters should still go out to their polling stations, even if the sites have been damaged. KIM GUADAGNO: What they will find instead is a Department of Defense truck with a well-situated National Guardsman and a big sign that says vote here. So go back to your polling place, anyway. LAWRENCE: But she spoke at a press conference where New Jersey Governor Chris Christie had already listed his top five priorities, and elections wasn't one of them. Many in the region seem to agree. Sam Koenig works at a bike shop on Lafayette Street in southern Manhattan. He's been eating canned food in the dark at his apartment nearby. SAM KOENIG: All the political stuff doesn't really matter at this point. There's a lot more important stuff going on right now that needs to be addressed. LAWRENCE: Koenig says he feels bad about it, but he's more interested in when the lights are coming back on than who wins the election. Quil Lawrence, NPR News, New York. Copyright \u00a9 2012 NPR.

A 1960s campaign poster supporting his father, George, is behind him. As Mitt Romney continues to deal with fallout from the secretly recorded \"47 percent\" fundraiser video that's gone viral, in which he dissed half the nation, more attention is being given to another recording featuring another Romney \u2014 his mother, Lenore. President John F. Kennedy was in the White House in 1962 when the current Republican presidential nominee's mother sat down for an interview to speak on behalf of her husband, George, who was then making his first run to be Michigan's governor. Buzzfeed's Andrew Kaczynski posted the video online on Sept. 7, well before the former Massachusetts governor's controversial comments about Obama supporters began to get widespread coverage. Buzzfeed describes the interview as an infomercial. Jon Stewart used a snip of the old footage of presidential candidate's mother on The Daily Show Tuesday. (It starts at about the 4:48 mark.) George Romney, born into a family that saw its fortunes decline when he was a child because of political unrest in Mexico, where he was born, became relatively wealthy as an adult. He was chief executive of American Motors Co. This led the 1962 interviewer to ask Mrs. Romney how her husband could relate to common people \u2014 given the high station he had achieved. INTERVIEWER: \"There are those who say that since he's a man of considerable means he really doesn't care about people.\" What's ironic, of course, is that the same question has been asked about her son ever since his first political campaign in 1994, when he ran for U.S. Senate. Back to her interview. LENORE ROMNEY: \"You know we've only owned our home for the last four years. He was a refugee from Mexico. He was on relief, welfare relief for the first years of his life. But this great country gave him opportunities. \"The family was poor. He said they lived for a year on nothing but potatoes. He's known what it is to have to work for every dime he's had since he was 12.\" The fact that the Republican presidential nominee's mother mentioned her husband's childhood on public assistance as part of her pitch to voters shows, if nothing else, how far the nation has moved on the welfare issue since the 1960s. George Romney won the 1962 gubernatorial election, the first of three he would win. The story of how young George came to be on welfare is fascinating in its own right and is told in the biography \"The Real Romney\" by journalists Michael Kranish and Scott Helman. The presidential nominee's great-grandfather Miles was asked in the late 1880s by Mormon officials to go to Mexico to create a colony where Mormons could practice polygamy far from the harassment of U.S. officials. It was there that Mitt Romney's grandfather Gaskell and father, George, were born into an increasingly prosperous family and Mormon community. But in 1912, George, then 5, and his family fled, with thousands of other Mormons, to the U.S. \u2014 chased out by Mexican rebels and largely leaving their wealth behind. \"The Real Romney\" reports: \"Fortunately for the Romneys, the U.S. government, which had once chased Miles to Mexico due to his polygamy, now welcomed the Romneys and other Mormons to the United States. Congress established a $100,000 relief fund that enabled the Romneys and other Mormon exiles to receive food and lodging. Initially, the [Romneys'] stay on U.S. soil was to be temporary. The El Paso Herald reported on October 25, 1912, that Gaskell Romney and his family, including little George, had gone to Los Angeles 'until it is safe for his family to return to the colonies in Mexico.' But Gaskell's family would never return to live there and made only a sentimental trip years later. Had they returned for good, Mitt Romney may never have been in a position to run for president.\" Instead, he was in a position to run for president. That's how he came to be in that Boca Raton house at that May fundraiser where he made the \"47 percent\" comment and others that he's now trying to put behind him.",

In fact, reviewing Clinton's exploits at the past 10 Democratic confabs offers a set of milestones for his entire career, while at the same time recapping four decades of convention history. 1972: A law student at Yale and former Rhodes scholar, Clinton attended his first national party rodeo with longish hair and facial hair. He was already living with Hillary Rodham, whom he met at law school, and they were both supporters of South Dakota Sen. George McGovern, the candidate most opposed to the Vietnam War. McGovern got the nomination, holding off a late charge by former Vice President Hubert Humphrey. McGovern would go on to lose 49 states to Richard Nixon that November, but the Clintons had established their knack for being with the nominee. 1976: Now a law professor at the University of Arkansas, a young and ambitious Bill Clinton was running for state attorney general (having already lost a bid for Congress in 1974). At the New York City convention, he joined other Southerners in backing former Georgia Gov. Jimmy Carter, who was nominated easily and went on to win the White House. Clinton also won his race that fall. 1980: Clinton attended the second convention to nominate Carter in New York City, this time as the sitting governor of Arkansas. He had won the job in 1978, becoming the nation's youngest governor at age 32. Clinton was already in demand as a spokesman for his generation, a rising star in Arkansas and Southern politics who was making a name for himself among governors. He supported Carter against the primary challenge mounted by Sen. Edward Kennedy, even though Carter's decision to house refugees from Cuba's \"Mariel Boatlift\" at Fort Chaffee in Arkansas was hurting Clinton's re-election bid back home. 1984: Clinton came to the convention once again as Arkansas' sitting governor, having lost that job in 1980 (partly because of the refugees) but regaining it in 1982. The Comeback Kid was born. The nominee that year in San Francisco was Carter's former vice president, Walter Mondale, who had won Arkansas' primary and the backing of its governor. The main Mondale challenger was Colorado Sen. Gary Hart, but most of the unions and the major party officeholders stuck with Mondale. Clinton also had to be aware that Hart, still in his 40s, was a generational rival. He had no such worries about Mondale, who would lose 49 states in Ronald Reagan's re-election landslide that fall. 1988: Once again, Clinton came to the convention backing the eventual nominee, this time his colleague from the Democratic Governors Association, Michael Dukakis of Massachusetts. On the second night in Atlanta, Clinton was called on to place Dukakis' name in nomination \u2014 taking more than twice his allotted time to do it. The convention hall erupted in cheers when Clinton finally said: \"In closing ...\" An overnight national laughingstock, he managed to turn the joke to his benefit with a deft, self-deprecating appearance on Johnny Carson's The Tonight Show. Once again, Clinton was the Comeback Kid. Once again, though, his choice for president lost in November, this time to Reagan's vice president, George H.W. Bush. 1992: Hard as it was to imagine just four years earlier, Clinton came to the New York City convention as the party's dominating central figure. He had survived controversies over draft dodging and marital infidelities, declaring himself the Comeback Kid as he rose in the primaries, outshining a lackluster field. Ross Perot, the billionaire independent candidate, suspended his campaign during the Democratic convention, temporarily convinced the Democrats were \"getting their act together.\" Clinton vaulted into the lead in national polls, partly because he and running mate Al Gore managed a tone-perfect convention (ending with Clinton's iconic \"I still believe in a place called Hope\"). The theme of generational change was underscored by the Fleetwood Mac song \"Don't Stop (Thinking About Tomorrow).\" In November, with Perot back in the mix, the Democrats easily dispatched the incumbent Bush. 1996: After two years of stumbling over issues such as health care, President Clinton lost control of both chambers of Congress in 1994 and saw a new generation of Republican leaders rise to confront him in Washington. One was House Speaker Newt Gingrich, and the other was Senate Majority Leader Bob Dole. But by convention time in 1996, Clinton had outmaneuvered Gingrich on the budget and opened a considerable lead in the polls over Dole, who had quit the Senate to be the GOP nominee. Clinton was the Comeback Kid yet again, and the Democrats were confident enough to return to Chicago, scene of the convention meltdown in 1968. This time, there was little conflict. The delegates danced \"The Macarena\" at every interlude, and the Clinton-Gore team got another four years. Hillary Clinton was given a featured speaking position. 2000: Upon re-election, Clinton and his administration were immediately besieged by accusations and congressional inquiries. One investigation led to another until a former White House intern accused the president of having sexual relations with her, leading to further accusations of perjury and obstruction of justice. Clinton was impeached by the House late in 1998 and acquitted by the Senate in February 1999. Gore easily won the nomination to succeed Clinton, whom he regarded as something between a distraction and a detriment to his campaign. Clinton had a limited role at the Los Angeles convention and during the fall campaign, which Gore barely lost to Texas Gov. George W. Bush. Many experts thought a greater role for Clinton (who left office with high approval ratings) might have turned the tide in a state or two, tilting the outcome to Gore. 2004: Clinton was back in a featured role at the Boston convention that nominated Massachusetts Sen. John Kerry for president. Both Bill and Hillary, elected a senator from New York in 2000, addressed the convention on Kerry's behalf. The former president, in particular, was highly effective in making Kerry's case. But both Clintons, and Kerry himself, were upstaged by the keynote speaker: a candidate for the U.S. Senate from Illinois named Barack Obama. The 2004 convention had been a chance for Clinton to be the Comeback Kid once again, as well as a chance for Hillary Clinton to step out as a potential future candidate in 2008 or 2012. As it happened, Kerry lost that fall and set the stage for Hillary Clinton's candidacy in 2008. For some, her nomination seemed a foregone conclusion \u2014 a coronation. 2008: All the speculation about relations between the Clintons and the Obamas harks back to the battle they fought against each other in 2007 and 2008. Hillary Clinton was initially the prohibitive frontrunner, enjoying leads of 25 and 30 percentage points in the polls. But Obama concentrated on Iowa and other caucus states, where he won big, and offset the Clinton edge in mega-states like California, Texas, New York, Pennsylvania and Ohio. By March, Obama had a lead the Clinton camp couldn't surmount. After many bitter words and recriminations, both Clintons came around to a party unity position and endorsed Obama at the Denver convention. There was no offer to give the vice presidential spot to Hillary Clinton, but she eventually was offered the top Cabinet job: secretary of state. In that position, she has served loyally and admirably. There have been many calls for her to join the ticket in 2012, but Vice President Joe Biden remains in place. 2012: Obama was not challenged in the Democratic primaries this year, as indeed Clinton wasn't in 1996. This is a tremendous boost for an incumbent, as is the absence of a threatening third party or independent candidate. But there lingers a sense that the Democrats never entirely healed the Obama-Clinton rift after 2008, and from time to time, Bill Clinton has said things the Obama team considered unhelpful. For the moment, no one in the Democratic party stands to gain from losing the White House. Hillary Clinton remains a formidable potential candidate in 2016, should she choose to run in her late 60s. That's a big reason why the Obama brain trust believes it can trust her husband to continue in the party unity mode tonight. It serves the Clintons' interest to keep the party together for next time, and it serves their interest to prevent Mitt Romney becoming an incumbent president \u2014 with the prerogatives and advantages of the White House to deploy in the next presidential cycle. Besides, if Obama is re-elected with the fully engaged support of the Clintons and all of their political assets, it has to play to their benefit in the history books. And that clearly matters to a man who has spent so much of his life at national party conventions, practicing politics for others and for himself. In any event, tonight's featured role gives Bill Clinton a chance to play the Comeback Kid one more time.",

            "article_content": "Former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney campaigns in Tampa, Fla., on Monday. \n                \n                    \n                    Emmanuel Dunand/AFP/Getty Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption Former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney campaigns in Tampa, Fla., on Monday. The issue  of immigration, which barely simmered during  the first three Republican presidential contests, could reach a boil now  that the candidates have arrived in Florida for the state's  Jan. 31 primary. Florida, with its large and influential Latino population, provides the earliest gauge of the difficulty facing any eventual GOP nominee in courting Hispanic voters, who increasingly view Republicans' rhetoric about immigration as anti-Hispanic. A tough stance on immigration broadly appeals to GOP primary voters, but less so in the general election of Americans more open to the idea of providing illegal immigrants a path to legal status, according to polling. And many Republicans worry that a perceived \"anti-immigrant\" nominee will undermine the party's 2012 strategy to reach out to Latinos in swing states, such as Nevada, Colorado and Virginia, who have grown ambivalent about President Obama.  A December survey of 500 Latino registered voters, conducted by impreMedia and the polling group Latino Decisions, showed that 46 percent of Hispanics believe Republicans \"don't care too much\" about them. Another 27 percent said Republicans \"are being hostile.\" \"They have a very serious problem,\" Matt Barreto, the principal pollster for Latino Decisions, has said of the Republican Party. At the same time, the poll also found that Hispanics' continued support for Obama has softened significantly since 2008. The candidate squarely in the crosshairs of Latino and pro-immigrant groups is former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney, who they warn will find a hostile reception in the Sunshine  State. Among his opponents, Romney has taken the toughest stance against illegal immigration, promising just before the Iowa caucuses that he'd veto a DREAM Act bill. Romney has opposed any form of amnesty for illegal immigrants. Last week, Romney campaigned in South Carolina with Kris Kobach, the Kansas secretary of state better known nationally as the architect of laws passed in Arizona, Alabama and elsewhere that crack down on illegal immigrants. In response, Somos Republicans, a grassroots Latino Republican group, decided to endorse former House Speaker Newt Gingrich. Several of Somos' leaders are working for the Gingrich campaign in various states, including Florida, citing his support for granting legal status to those who have lived most of their lives in the United States. Somos has called on two of Florida's leading Latino politicians, Republican Reps. Mario Diaz-Balart and Ileana Ros-Lehtinen, to withdraw their endorsements of Romney (the lawmakers have shown no such inclination). \"Romney is committing political suicide,\" says DeeDee Garcia Blase, who founded Somos but no longer runs it. Blase, once a GOP organizer in Arizona, has renounced her party affiliation in protest over the Republican-led state laws modeled on the 2010 bill passed in her home state. Blase has formed the nonpartisan Tequila Party, a group aimed at countering Tea Party groups that seeks to mobilize Latinos to vote for candidates who support the granting of legal status for immigrants. \"There's a change going in Florida right now, based on this whole Kris Kobach endorsement. It's really lighting up Latino media,\" Blase says. Cuban Americans Power The Florida GOP Florida is arguably the only state where Latino Republican voters matter in presidential primaries, thanks to the fiercely party-loyal bloc of Cuban Americans in South  Florida. They were a driving force in Republican John McCain's pivotal 2008 victory there. Latinos make up about 22.5 percent of Florida's population, according to the Census Bureau. Cuban Americans number roughly 1.2 million, about 28.6 percent of the state's Latino population. And Latinos make up about 13 percent of Florida's registered voters. Both Romney and Gingrich are aggressively trying to lock in the support of prominent Latinos in Florida. So far, Romney's stance on immigration isn't hurting his efforts. Romney months ago received the endorsements of several of Florida's most prominent Latino politicians, Reps. Mario Diaz-Balart and Ileana Ros-Lehtinen, and Diaz-Balart's brother, Lincoln, a former congressman. Romney also has the support of former Sen. Mel Martinez. All of them are Cuban American Republicans. Reps. Diaz-Balart and Ros-Lehtinen part company from Romney by supporting the DREAM Act, which would establish a path to citizenship for as many as 800,000 people under age 36 who arrived in the U.S. as children and attend college or serve in the military. Pro-immigrant activists say a recent encounter between Diaz-Balart and a DREAM Act supporter in Miami signals what they have planned for Romney in Florida. On a campaign stop promoting Romney's candidacy last week, Diaz-Balart was challenged by a DREAM Act supporter in the audience. \"You have been such a friend to us, I just don't understand,\" the local college student told Diaz-Balart in Spanish, referring to the congressman's support for Romney. Another prominent Cuban American, Al Cardenas, a key Romney backer during his 2008 presidential bid, has decided to remain neutral during the primaries due to his position as the head of the American Conservative Union. So, too, has Florida Sen. Marco Rubio, one of the GOP's rising stars who also is Cuban American and from Miami. For his part, Gingrich has hitched his Hispanic outreach in part to South Florida's third congressman, David Rivera, whose support could be dubious given that Rivera is the target of ongoing criminal investigations. Gingrich's Florida steering committee includes Cuban Americans, and past political enemies, Xavier Suarez and Joe Carollo, both former mayors of Miami. Leading the campaign's national Hispanic outreach is longtime Gingrich aide Sylvia Garcia, who is based in Miami. Immigration Less Important To Florida Hispanics Ultimately, the immigration debate sure to start this week in Florida\u2014as early as the debate in Tampa Monday night\u2014will be about optics for Latinos outside the state. Many Latinos in Florida aren't so sensitive to immigration issues. That's because the majority of Cuban Americans have legal status, thanks to U.S. policy uniquely granting immigrants from the island political asylum. And the state's second-largest Hispanic group, Puerto Ricans, are American citizens. \"Latinos in Florida are much less worried about immigration,\" says political science professor Eduardo Gamarro, of Florida International University. \"Here we more than likely have solved our immigration problems and our families are probably in route to solving their immigration problems, or have solved them.\" Gamarro says Hispanics in Florida are more concerned about the economy and jobs, a key reason Diaz-Balart and Ros-Lehtinen are able to support Romney without facing backlash from their Cuban American constituents. \"That's a very disciplined voting bloc,\" Gamarro says of Cuban Americans. \"Romney can come down here and maybe tone down some of his statements, but he's not going to get in trouble with the Hispanic voters who really matter. He has more to leeway to say things here than he would among other Hispanic groups in the country.\" But the rhetoric in Florida is being closely watched by Latinos nationwide. \"Most Republicans are aware of the problem, and I think Romney is very aware of the need for Republicans to do better with that segment of the electorate,\" says Jack Pitney, a political science professor at Claremont McKenna College in California. \"But it's a tough balance. On the one hand, your base wants a tough stand on immigration, but you also have to win the general election.\"",

            "article_content": "Venezuelans go to the polls Sunday in an election that will decide if President Hugo Chavez remains in power. Polls indicate it's his most serious electoral challenge since taking office nearly 14 years ago, and it's mobilizing large numbers of voters in Venezuela \u2014 and in the U.S. Nearly 20,000 Venezuelans living in Florida are registered to vote, and most arrived in the past decade, since Chavez took power. He upended the old power structure, installing a socialist government that seized property and nationalized industries. One of the expatriates is Lophanie Bertrand, 94, who says she's determined to cast her ballot Sunday to oust Chavez. She says he has caused a lot of pain, and poor people in Venezuela don't have enough to eat. Bertrand arrived in Miami several years ago, accompanying her daughter, a political activist and Chavez opponent who received political asylum. But like all Venezuelans in Miami, to vote, Bertrand will have to travel nearly 900 miles to New Orleans. That's because earlier this year, Chavez closed the Venezuelan consulate in Miami. He took that action after the U.S. State Department expelled the Venezuelan consul, charging that she was involved in a cyberterrorism plot. Venezuelans here believe the consulate was closed in a deliberate effort to disenfranchise them \u2014 to discourage them from voting. Bertrand now lives in Miami with another daughter, Giselle Beauvoir. But Beauvoir says when she began investigating the cost of traveling by air with her mother to New Orleans to vote, she realized it would be too expensive. \"I was so sad, thinking about what the best to do,\" Beauvoir says. \"Because I couldn't tell my mother, 'Listen, in this election, you aren't going to be able to vote.' It's the most important election I think in her life.\" Fortunately for Beauvoir and her mother, they'll be flying to New Orleans free because of a group of volunteers. In a conference room in downtown Miami, seven young Venezuelans are working the phones and their laptops. They're part of Aerovotar, a group that raised enough money to book six charter flights to New Orleans to help Venezuelans vote. The seats are being mostly filled by elderly and disabled Venezuelans who may not be up to the 16-hour bus ride to New Orleans. It's a nonpartisan group, but volunteer Alyssa Perez concedes the vast majority of those involved, in fact the vast majority of Venezuelans in the U.S., oppose Chavez. \"We're out of our country for a reason, you know. And it's basically, well, because of the current government. Most of us want to be able to go back to our country, maybe not live there, but be able to go back and forth and have our children go there. And we still have families we have to fight for there. So, I think that is what got us all together,\" Perez says. Some 1,100 Venezuelans will be flying from Miami on Sunday. Many more will travel in buses. In all, up to 8,000 Venezuelans from Florida are expected to make the trip. Volunteer organizer Beatriz Olavarria says most will vote for Chavez challenger Henrique Capriles. Unlike in Venezuela, Olavarria says, voters in this country don't fear harassment when they cast their ballots. \"The government will make sure, they will threaten you, they will scare you, they will, you know, do last-minute things that you're going to think about it. Outside of Venezuela, we don't have that. We're not going to be jobless because we go vote and so on and so forth. So, it's a genuine vote that only wants the best for the country,\" Olavarria says. Olavarria's only concern now is whether the Venezuelan consulate in New Orleans will be able to handle several thousand determined Venezuelan voters.",

It would be hard to beat last June's cataclysmic, cacophonous end of the Supreme Court term and the decision upholding the Obama health care law. But while all the media focus is on the upcoming elections, the U.S. Supreme Court is about to begin yet another headline-making term, with decisions expected on affirmative action in higher education, same-sex marriage, the Voting Rights Act and a lot of privacy issues. The court opens the term Monday by taking a look at a case brought by 12 Nigerians granted political asylum in the United States. They sued Shell Oil for allegedly conspiring with the Nigerian government to torture and kill locals in order to stop environmental protests against oil exploration. The suit was brought under the Alien Tort Statute, a federal law enacted in 1789 by the first U.S. Congress and aimed primarily at pirates. The law says that U.S. trial courts can hear civil damage suits brought by a foreign national for \"wrongs committed in violation of the law of nations, or a treaty of the United States.\" For the past 30 years, victims of human rights violations have used the statute to sue their tormentors in U.S. courts. Eight years ago, the Supreme Court appeared to endorse these suits as long as the claims are based on \"universally condemned human rights violations\" such as torture and genocide. Now, however, the court seems to be backing away from that decision. Last year the court heard the Nigerians' case to see if the statute allowed suits against corporations. But instead of deciding the case, the court ordered re-argument on a broader question: whether the law permits anyone to sue in U.S. courts over an alleged violation of international law on foreign soil. \"What is at issue now is no less than whether this statute is going to have any continuing significance as a source for addressing human rights violations,\" says Irv Gornstein, director of the Supreme Court Institute at Georgetown University. The reason is that virtually all human rights cases brought under the statute to date have involved events that took place outside the U.S., even though, in some cases, both parties to the suit were in the U.S. This is a term about pacing. How far the court is going to go, how fast. ... Will it broadly or narrowly deal with same-sex marriage? Will it invalidate Section Five of the Voting Rights Act, or find some way out of it? Will it get rid of affirmative action or carve back on it? Tom Goldstein, SCOTUSblog Indeed, the case is indicative of the term, says Supreme Court advocate Tom Goldstein, publisher of SCOTUSblog, the leading blog about the Supreme Court. \"This is a term about pacing,\" he says. \"How far the court is going to go, how fast. ... Will it broadly or narrowly deal with same-sex marriage? Will it invalidate Section Five of the Voting Rights Act, or find some way out of it? Will it get rid of affirmative action or carve back on it?\" Of all the cases Goldstein mentioned, only one, affirmative action, has actually already been granted review by the court. In that case, from the University of Texas, the court is revisiting an issue it has twice before decided. In 1978 the justices ruled that state colleges and universities could use race as one of many factors in determining school admissions. Quotas, however, were forbidden. In 2003, the court reaffirmed that ruling by a 5-4 vote. But Justice Sandra Day O'Connor, who authored the opinion, has since retired and been replaced by Justice Samuel Alito, a fierce foe of any race considerations in college admissions. Thus, in agreeing to re-examine yet again the issue of affirmative action, a newly energized conservative court majority seems to be signaling that it will either reverse or cut back on its previous rulings. Several other big cases are waiting in the wings at the court, and will almost certainly be granted full review. One is the Defense of Marriage Act, the federal law defining marriage as between a man and a woman. When the law was enacted in 1996, no state had legalized gay marriage. Now, gay marriage is legal in six states and the District of Columbia, and gay married couples have challenged the federal law as unconstitutional discrimination. Among the challengers: a widow who had to pay hundreds of thousands of dollars more in estate taxes because the federal government did not recognize her state-recognized marriage as legal, and legally married gay couples denied spousal Social Security benefits or federal government employee spousal medical benefits. Seven lower courts have agreed that the federal law is unconstitutional, and now a variety of these cases have been appealed to the Supreme Court. Georgetown Law professor Louis Michael Seidman notes that the cases are evidence of how much times have changed. \"It is worth remembering that DOMA was signed by Bill Clinton. It was approved by overwhelming majorities of Congress just a few years ago,\" he says, observing that the whole idea of gay marriage was a \"really fringe position held by very, very few people\" back then, and now, \"quite suddenly, we have half the country, at least, thinking, 'What's wrong with gay marriage?' \" Another gay marriage case, California's Proposition 8, which outlawed such unions, is also awaiting action by the high court. The law was struck down by a federal appeals court based in California but on grounds that are idiosyncratic to that state. The Supreme Court could decide the DOMA case, leave gay marriage to the states for now, and thus dodge the decision as to whether gay couples have a constitutional right to marry. Still another issue on its way to the court is the Voting Rights Act and its requirement that certain areas with a history of racial discrimination have to seek clearance from the Justice Department or the federal court in Washington when changes are made to voting procedures. Just three years ago, the justices in an 8-1 decision upheld the law. The opinion, however, written by Chief Justice John Roberts, was so critical of the law that more challenges have been brought and are now back at the court.",

She is now serving a seven-year term, but her supporters say the charges against her were politically motivated. Evgeniya Tymoshenko has her mother's looks \u2014 minus the trademark blond braid that makes her mother, former Ukrainian Prime Minister Yulia Tymoshenko, quickly recognizable. But the younger Tymoshenko says she's not a politician. She never imagined herself testifying on Capitol Hill, getting face time with Secretary of State Hillary Clinton at a prayer breakfast, or speaking to reporters at a K Street lobbying firm. \"I had to start participating in this process since my mother's arrest, actually, and I became her public defender since August; and I was able to see the really shameful process against her and other ex-politicians, opposition politicians,\" Evgeniya Tymoshenko says. The United States has described the case against Yulia Tymoshenko as politically motivated. She served twice as prime minister, first for a brief period in 2005, and then from 2007 until 2010. But after losing the presidential election in 2010, she was prosecuted for her role in negotiations with Russia over gas sales when she was prime minister.

Here, she speaks with the media in Kiev on Oct. 12, 2011, the day after her mother was convicted. Tymoshenko's daughter says she's being held in harsh conditions. \"Her cell is always lit 24 hours a day and she's under video surveillance, which they say is for her own safety but it's obviously just to put more psychological pressure on her,\" Evgeniya Tymoshenko says. Though the 31-year-old worries about her mother's health, she says the former prime minister won't be broken, and is even winning over her prison guards. \"Her fiery character and her courage, political courage is what charges people to fight for their rights; and that's what happened during the protests she organized,\" she says. Rise To Power Back in 2004, Tymoshenko did whip up the crowds to protest fraudulent elections in what became known as the Orange Revolution. She seemed an unlikely reformer, having amassed a fortune in the 1990s in the shady energy sector. A former U.S. ambassador to Ukraine, Steven Pifer says there were lots of questions about her then. \"I remember having a conversation with a Ukrainian in 2000 or 2001, and I said, 'Explain to me how you see Yulia Tymoshenko.' And the response was, 'Well, maybe she stole her millions already, but she actually now appears to want to do something good for the country. She wants to give something back,' \" Pifer says. Pifer, now with the Brookings Institution, says that in recent years the U.S. has worked well with her, and credits her with cleaning up Ukraine's energy sector. But now, a man she bitterly opposes, Viktor Yanukovich, is president, having defeated her two years ago. Pifer says Yanukovich might be pursuing the case against her because of personal animosity, but it's backfiring. \"Her poll ratings were single digits, her party was in single digits,  and she was kind of off the radar screen,\" he says. \"What's happened with the trial last year is they've now sort of put her back on the front page, so it's had this ironic effect in terms of bringing her back in the spotlight.\" And it's made Ukraine's relations with the West more complicated, because the case is seen here as one of many examples of backsliding on democracy. The picture Tymoshenko's daughter is painting sounds like a new Stalinist regime in Ukraine. \"I know that my phones are tapped and  that somebody is watching me wherever I go,\" she says. \"Obviously I feel pressure because my relatives, even my grandfather, is under investigation now.\" Still, Evgeniya Tymoshenko, who spent nearly a decade in London and married a British rock singer, plans to stay in Ukraine and fight for her mother's cause. Her father received political asylum in the Czech Republic.",

            "article_content": "An update on Sunday's election in one of Spain's most prosperous regions, Catalonia, which many view as a referendum on independence.  STEVE INSKEEP, HOST: Now let's catch up on a vote in Catalonia, Spain's most economically powerful region. That region gave overwhelming support to pro-independence parties in elections on Sunday. This election is seen as a threat to Spain's political and financial stability, so we're going to talk about this with NPR's Sylvia Poggioli. She is in the most famous city in Catalonia, Barcelona. And, Sylvia, we did say that there were pro-independence parties. Who exactly won these elections? SYLVIA POGGIOLI, BYLINE: Well, all the pro-independent parties won together a big majority, but the ruling party, Convergence and Unity, or CIU, which called an early election in the hopes of winning an absolute majority, was punished. And it lost 12 of its 62 seats. Its leader Artur Mas was a recent convert to independence, but he's also the politician who's inflicted harsh austerity measures on Catalonia. The surprise result was the Republican left, which has always been stridently pro-independence. It doubled its votes, 20 seats. So the underlying message is that the majority of Catalans are sick and tired of that their taxes are being siphoned off by the central Spanish government, and that they get little in return. They're convinced that independence would help them get out of the worst crisis in their history. INSKEEP: I'm trying to better understand this crisis, Sylvia. Would you just remind us - Spain, of course, is caught up in the credit crisis that has hit so much of Europe and has an unemployment rate of, what, 20 percent or more? SYLVIA POGGIOLI BYLINE: Twenty-five percent and its 50 percent for youth. It's a very serious crisis. It's not quite yet as bad as Greece but it's on its way. And even in this very wealthy area - Catalonia, the most prosperous and the big powerhouse of Spain - we see an awful lot of poverty on the streets. You see homeless people sleeping in ATM closures; and these are not immigrants. It's hurting. Unemployment and the poverty level is at 30 percent. INSKEEP: Trying to understand why independence would be the answer. Do people in this prosperous region feel that the rest of the country is dragging them down? BYLINE: That's exactly right. And at the same time, you know, Catalonia has its own language and culture that was long repressed during the Franco dictatorship. It long aspired to be a country on its own. But three years of economic crisis have really fueled nationalism and separatism. INSKEEP: So what are the practical effects here, Sylvia? I'm thinking of Canada where the Province of Quebec has repeatedly had votes on independence, but the country has not come apart. Is it really possible that Spain could come apart? BYLINE: Well, you know, everybody is very alarmed. Madrid is very alarmed. Catalonia represents one-fifth of the entire Spanish economy. As one newspaper put it: Without Catalonia, Espana would become Expana. Spain, as I said, is undergoing its worst economic crisis since the Civil War and Catalonia is following that. But Catalonia doesn't want to pay anymore for the poorer regions. It's very possible that they are - Madrid and Barcelona - as I say, are going to be on a collision course because the central government, Madrid, is vehemently opposed to any kind of referendum. They say it's against the constitution. INSKEEP: So is there any room for compromise here? BYLINE: It seems very little. There's very little room for compromise because up until now, Madrid has been vehemently opposed to any kind of negotiations with Catalonia. And it refuses even kind of a giving a little bit of more fiscal autonomy to Catalonia. That's why the leader of the ruling party here culled the elections; it's part of a power struggle between Catalonia and the rest of Spain. It's going to be very hard to see what can happen here. The new government here will be a coalition of two parties - one on the left and on the right - and the only thing they share is independence. They probably will press for a referendum on independence and that's going to only probably dig even more confrontation with Madrid. INSKEEP: And are there wider concerns for the rest of Europe which, of course, is going through this crisis of which Spain is a big part? BYLINE: Well, the EU has never had to face the breakup of a member state. And Spain is not alone in raising the problem. There's also Scotland and Belgium that are part of a rising tide of fragmentation within the EU. However EU officials say not so fast, a hypothetical new independent state in Europe would have to face the same membership conditions as all the others. And that includes the veto power of member states - and that means Spain. It's interesting that when you look at the polls, more than a majority of Catalans want an independent state. But only 37 percent would embrace it, if it means being excluded from the European Union. INSKEEP: NPR's Sylvia Poggioli is in Barcelona, in Catalonia which, for now, is part of Spain. Sylvia, thanks very much. BYLINE: Thank you, Steve. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) INSKEEP: This is NPR News. Copyright \u00a9 2012 NPR.  All rights reserved.

            "article_content": "Unpopular Japanese prime minister Yoshihiko Noda dissolved Japan's lower house of parliament today, and called for national elections. Voters have increasingly disapproved of Noda, his predecessor and their Democratic Party of Japan since the tsunami and earthquake in March, 2011. Japanese prime minister Yoshihiko Noda\n                \n                    \n                    Vincnt Thian/AP\n                    \n                \nhide caption Japanese prime minister Yoshihiko Noda They're also angry over the related Fukushima nuclear power plant accident related to the quake, which has forced the country to grapple with new energy plans and costs. The Japan Times helpfully lays out other reasons why Noda is out of favor: a slowing economy and terrible relations with neighboring China. The Associated Press adds people hate the newly doubled sales tax. The election is set for Dec. 16, says Kyodo News. Noda is already campaigning for office. He told reporters his party wants to make Japan free of nuclear power in 20 years. But he might not get the chance to work toward that goal. Noda could be replaced as Japan's leader by the head of the opposition party, former prime minister Shinzo Abe; he actually resigned the job five years ago amid scandals in his Liberal Democratic Party and the belief he wasn't up to the job. The Wall Street Journal says this week, Abe suggested if elected, his LDP will take a more aggressive monetary stance to deal with inflation. And he warned of an increase in military spending to 'maintain the power balance with China'. Shinzo Abe\n                \n                    \n                    Koji Sasahara/AP\n                    \n                \nhide caption Shinzo Abe Abe has been more hawkish on Japan's simmering dispute with China over a group of islands in the East China Sea that both claim. Japan bought the islands in September from a private Japanese citizen and nationalized them, enraging China, which terms it a 'provocation'. Noda cautions that tough talking over China can backfire. \"Healthy nationalism is necessary, but if one goes to extremes, it becomes jingoism,\" he said, according to Reuters. Polls in Japan don't suggest either candidate will win outright, says the AP. Abe's LDP would win the most seats in the lower house, but not enough to secure a majority if the vote were held today. If that polling remains constant, the LDP could end up in a new coalition with Noda's Democratic Party of Japan.",

            "article_content": "The Obama administration will soon be dealing with new leadership in Japan. Over the weekend, Japanese voters returned a former prime minister to the country's top job. Shinzo Abe took an assertive stand on several issues during the election, sparking concern in the U.S. his win could stir up tension in the region.  DAVID GREENE, HOST: And there is new leadership in another Asian nation. Over the weekend, Japanese voters returned a former prime minister to the country's top job. Shinzo Abe took an assertive stand on several big issues during the election. And as NPR's Jackie Northam reports, this sparked concern in the United States that his win could stir up tensions in the region. JACKIE NORTHAM, BYLINE: There was a strong current of nationalism running through Shinzo Abe's campaign. He took a hawkish position on territorial issues and a less-apologetic approach to Japan's recent history. That may have helped the 58-year-old Abe capture the prime minister's seat, but it also created a nervousness among some allies, including the U.S., says Sheila Smith, a Japan specialist at the Council on Foreign Relations. SHEILA SMITH: I think there's a certain amount of ambiguity about how he wants to proceed, especially on security and foreign policy issues. NORTHAM: Smith says there are several causes for concern in Washington, among them, how Abe will handle bitter territorial claims with China over disputed islands in the East China Sea. Although Japan has administered the islands for decades, China claimed sovereignty, and has been sending patrol boats into the area. Under a U.S.-Japan treaty, the U.S. is obligated to defend Japanese territory. Smith says there is deep concern in Washington about how to manage the dispute. SMITH: The United States is an ally of Japan, and therefore wants to support Japanese efforts to defend its territory. On the other hand, no one in Washington wants to see escalating tensions between Japan and China, let alone anything that might lead to a calculated or miscalculated use of force between the two countries. NORTHAM: But Ely Ratner - who until recently was on the China Desk at the State Department - says it's likely the U.S. has already been reaching out to Abe's party and Beijing to try to calm the situation. Ratner, now with the Center for a New American Security, says there are other issues that can potentially create bigger problems, particularly with other U.S. allies in the region. Abe has denied aspects of Japan's wartime history, including its use of women from Korea and other occupied countries as sex slaves for its military. Ratner says that will have major repercussions for relations with South Korea. ELY RATNER: And this poses a challenge for the United States, who has treaty relations with both Seoul and Tokyo. And I think it befuddles a lot of American strategists that those two countries can't get along better, particularly in the face of a rising China. NORTHAM: Or as the U.S. tries to deal with North Korea's nuclear program. Washington needs all its allies in the region to be on the same page. Michael Green, with the Center for Strategic and International Studies, says Abe's overheated rhetoric is much different than his track record. Green says Abe had a strong nationalist edge to him when he first became Japan's prime minister in 2006, but he quickly took a more pragmatic view and actually improved relations with China and Korea. Green says Abe will likely moderate his rhetoric now that he's won the election. MICHAEL GREEN: As a matter of realpolitik - and Abe is a strategic realpolitik kind of thinker - I think he'll drop it. And certainly I think the U.S. government is quietly encouraging him to do that so that we can move forward together to deal with the problems we face today and in the future. NORTHAM: Washington will have a chance to do that soon enough. Abe says his first visit when he takes office will be to the U.S. Jackie Northam, NPR News, Washington. Copyright \u00a9 2012 NPR.

            "article_content": "Japan holds elections tomorrow for the lower house of parliament, which is more powerful than the upper house, and which has more control over the budget and selects the prime minister. Over the years, the country has been plagued by a succession of weak leaders.  SCOTT SIMON, HOST: Japanese voters go to the polls tomorrow. They are expected to toss out the ruling party. Shinzo Abe is likely to become prime minister for the second time. Japan faces another economic slide, rising nationalist rhetoric and a dangerous stand-off with China. NPR's Frank Langfitt reports from Tokyo on the politics that are roiling America's top ally in Asia. (APPLAUSE) FRANK LANGFITT, BYLINE: At a rally this week, Toshiharu Furukawa, a member of Japan's parliament, outlined the country's decline since his Liberal Democratic Party was ousted after more than a half century of nearly uninterrupted rule. TOSHIHARU FURUKAWA: (Through Translator) Three years and three months has passed since the general election of summer 2009. What has happened? Gross national product, which had been six trillion, has dropped to $300 billion. So the sales from your shops go down and down. Furthermore, your salaries go down and down. LANGFITT: At a bullet train station outside Tokyo, Furukawa said, meanwhile, neighboring countries are feuding with Japan over islands it claims as its own. FURUKAWA: (Through Translator) Korea and China are violating Japanese waters and now we are in historically our worst relation with other countries. LANGFITT: Shinzo Abe, the leader of the Liberal Democratic Party, then pledged to restore the Japanese nation. SHINZO ABE: (Foreign language spoken) LANGFITT: Children born in Japan can have pride in having been born here, he said. We should take back Japan. ABE: (Foreign language spoken) LANGFITT: Kazuya Okamoto, a laid-off garage mechanic, stood in the crowd, his face impassive. He wore a blue Converse hoodie and a black watch cap. At age 30, Okamoto never knew Japan's boom years of the 1980s, only the stagnation that followed. KAZUYA OKAMOTO: (Through Translator) The economy has always been bad since I was aware of it. It was already in what is now called, the lost decades. LANGFITT: Okamoto has applied for at least 30 jobs in the last six months with no replies. Were it not for his parents, he'd be homeless. Okamoto backed the Democratic Party of Japan, the current ruling party, when it swept to power amid great hopes. OKAMOTO: (Through Translator) I thought they would make a change. From this experience, now I can't trust what is said by any party. LANGFITT: Analysts say the DPJ was inexperienced and lost its way politically. Jeffrey Kingston, director of Asian Studies at Temple University Japan, says disillusionment is widespread. JEFFREY KINGSTON: Most people are very disenchanted with politics in Japan. They feel very disappointed in the ruling DPJ, but I don't think many people see a lot of hope in the LDP. LANGFITT: This year, political rhetoric has shifted to the right. Koichi Nakano is a professor of political science at Tokyo's Sophia University. He says Abe has shared flag-draped stages with people who deny Japanese war-time atrocities against the Chinese. KOICHI NAKANO: It really looks like pre-war Japan or something in some of the footages. I thought it was very worrying, I couldn't believe that the Japanese have, you know, now is going to that extreme to embrace nationalism that only provides phony solutions. LANGFITT: If Abe does become prime minister again, he'll have to manage the island dispute with an increasingly aggressive China. The tenor of this campaign probably won't help.

Considered a nationalist hawk, Abe is expected to become prime minister for a second time after parliamentary elections Sunday. As Japanese head to the polls Sunday, Shinzo Abe is expected to become Japan's prime minister for the second time. The election takes place as nationalistic rhetoric is on the rise, and while the country remains locked in a bitter dispute with its chief rival, China, over islands both countries claim. 'Pride And Honor' The battle over the islands heated up last summer. In mid-August, boats filled with about 150 Japanese activists approached one of the islands, part of a chain that the Japanese call Senkaku; the Chinese, Diaoyu. Satoru Mizushima, leader of a nationalist group called Ganbare Nippon! \u2014 Go For It, Japan! \u2014 wrapped a rope around his waist, slipped into the green waters and swam toward shore. Battered by waves, Mizushima climbed up the coral shoreline and \u2014 in his eyes \u2014 reclaimed the island for Japan. Mizushima says he planned the landing as a response to a group from Hong Kong that had earlier landed on the island and claimed it for China. Back at his office in Tokyo this week, Mizushima says more is at stake than an empty rock in the East China Sea. \"This is not just about having a small island taken away,\" Mizushima says. \"It means Japanese national sovereignty as well as pride and honor are taken away.\" Japanese nationalists condemn China at a rally in Tokyo in September.

Japan and China are locked in a bitter dispute over a group of islands claimed by both countries. Few 'Friendly Feelings' Toward China The dispute exploded in September after Japan's government bought several of the islands. Anti-Japanese demonstrations erupted across China, horrifying most Japanese. But Mizushima was delighted. He saw it as a wake-up call for his countrymen to the threats Japan faces. \"Japanese people are too peace-oriented,\" Mizushima says. \"I want China to take more actions, like invading the Senkaku Islands and organizing demonstrations in China and burning Japanese factories. So I want to thank China for doing it.\" Mizushima's island landing was a political stunt, but many analysts say Japan's rightward tilt is real. A recent poll showed a record 81 percent of Japanese do not hold \"friendly feelings\" toward China. Even some on the right worry about growing nationalism. Kunio Suzuki, an adviser with Issuikai, a far-right political group that honors Japan's imperial family and traditional culture, was against Mizushima's trip to the island.  \"That's dangerous,\" Suzuki says. \"I think the whole society is shifting to the right. The more right-wing people have a louder voice.\" Years ago, he says, many people supported Japan's pacifist Constitution \u2014 which renounces the right to go to war. But these days, Suzuki continues, \"there are many people who think the Constitution is bad, it should be changed and we should change from a self-defense force to conventional military.\" Legislatively, that would be very hard to do in Japan. And it wouldn't go over well in East Asia, which still has terrible memories of Japanese aggression during World War II. Domestic Disquiet A number of factors seem to be driving rhetoric to the right in Japan. Japanese people are exhausted by the country's interminable economic problems. Suzuki says they're also tired of the country's revolving-door leadership. \"Japanese leaders don't even last a year in power. They have no capability to deal with foreign affairs,\" he says. \"This trend increased after the Democratic Party of Japan came into power ... so people became frustrated and found the DPJ useless and weak.\" Events in recent days have only compounded that sentiment, as the island nation's neighbors have appeared to taunt Japan. On Wednesday, North Korea fired a rocket over the Japanese island of Okinawa. And Thursday, Japan said a Chinese government plane flew near the disputed island chain, which Japan effectively controls. But some analysts say much of the right-wing rhetoric is coming from Japanese politicians \u2014 and that most ordinary Japanese remain politically moderate. \"The nationalist reaction is mostly related to the elite here,\" says Jeffrey Kingston, director of Asian studies at Temple University's Japan Campus. \"I think at the grass-roots level, there hasn't been much of a reaction. We haven't seen anti-Chinese demonstrations outside the embassy. We haven't seen Chinese businesses affected or smashed or boycotted.\" On the streets of Tokyo this week, people were more interested in talking about domestic issues. \"I'm against increasing military power,\" says Nobutaka Hannuki, a 30-year-old who works in marketing. \"What they should do now is restore the tsunami disaster area.\" Nearly two years after the massive earthquake, much of Japan's northeast coast has yet to be rebuilt. Hannuki, who spent six months in the country's self-defense forces, is worried his country could spark an arms race. If Japan builds up its military, he says, he expects other nations to do the same in what is becoming an increasingly dangerous neighborhood.",

Voters in Spain's northern region of Catalonia go to the polls Sunday in a parliamentary election that is shaping up as an unofficial referendum on secession. The current Catalan president has pledged to pursue a move toward independence if re-elected. The region, which holds 8 million people, is the country's industrial engine. Catalans are resentful that their taxes are being siphoned off for poorer regions. The prospect of secession is opposed both by the Madrid government and the European Union. 'We Are Not Spaniards' The prosperous town of Vic is the heartland of Catalan patriotism. The central square is festooned with red and yellow Catalan flags, symbols of independence aspirations. Local bookstore owner Jordi Anglada says there's a new wave of historical novels about three centuries of Catalan heroism against Spanish domination. The title of one book is Either Free or Dead. The Catalan language re-emerged from suppression only after the end of the Franco dictatorship 37 years ago. It has since displaced Spanish as the official language in schools and public offices. The economic crisis has reawakened old resentments. \"We are not Spaniards \u2014 we have a different culture, different language, different attitude\" says lung surgeon Christian Domingo. \"We are different people.\" Like many Catalans, Domingo says his region is being exploited. \"The Spanish government comes here, invests 10 percent and gets 100 percent,\" he says. \"And this is what you do with colonies.\" A Renewed Wave Of Support The pro-independence tide turned two months ago, when huge numbers of people took to the streets of Barcelona on Catalan National Day. The leader of the regional government, Artur Mas, a center-right politician \u2014 who has long been criticized for financial mismanagement \u2014 seized the moment. He wrapped himself in the Catalan flag and called early elections. On posters, Mas presented himself as Moses guiding his people toward a new, independent promised land. Even along the elegant streets of cosmopolitan Barcelona, flags are everywhere. Election excitement has replaced economic gloom. In the Placa del Rei, surrounded by Gothic palaces, several hundred young people are joyfully square-dancing to the tune of traditional Catalan songs. Schoolteacher Laura Torra, 30, doesn't want to dwell on her wage cuts. She's here to celebrate her Catalan identity and culture. She's keenly aware how Catalan language and traditions were repressed under Franco. \"Catalan, it was not allowed to [be spoken] in the streets, Catalan families [had] to talk Catalan in secret because, if not, it was punished,\" she says. Deeper Economic Troubles There are numerous pro-independence parties on both the left and right. The dream of secession has become a panacea for the region's economic ills, ignored by politicians and the media. No one seems to notice the many homeless people who sleep at night on the floor of ATM enclosures, or the sporadic demonstrations by the growing number of jobless. Political analyst Lluis Foix says too many people are being blinded by the Catalan flag. \"The flag, in many cases, is trying to hide corruption, for instance, how employment is not rising, how education is worsening,\" he says. \"It explains why many young people are leaving for other countries of Europe or of the world.\" Catalan leader Mas has vowed that, if returned to power, he'll call a referendum on independence. Spanish Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy warns that would violate the constitution, and members of his center-right party say the army could be used to protect Spanish sovereignty. Statements like that fuel Catalan patriotism. At Mas' closing rally, tens of thousands of his followers filled a large stadium. They shouted in unison, \"Independence now!\" Whatever the outcome of Sunday's election, the secessionist genie is out of the bottle.",

With the election very nearly upon us, you might think the opera house would offer some respite from the dominant issues of the presidential campaign. Well, yes \u2014 and no. Composers from Monteverdi to Verdi used the operatic stage to further the debates of their days and to make political statements. In Monteverdi's case, he attempted to present Venice as the great superpower of his time; Verdi broached all manner of political intrigue in his work, from his allusion to the assassination of Sweden's King Gustav III in Ballo in maschera to Italian nationalism in Attila and Nabucco. Following in this ageless tradition, today's composers have also used opera as a frame in which to explore today's most pressing concerns, from terrorism to the ups and downs of the U.S.-China relationship. What's changed, though, is how modern artists approach these topics. Rather than issuing polemics, the best composers delve deep for intimately drawn character studies portraying the lives and stories behind the headlines and sound bites \u2014 a world away from the stereotype of the opportunistic \"CNN opera.\"  Composer Christopher Theofanidis was searching for a way to create a work that referenced the World Trade Center attacks; he knew he'd found his subject after opera director Francesca Zambello suggested he read Heart of a Soldier. It is the true story of Sept. 11 hero and decorated U.S. Army veteran Rick Rescorla, who is credited with saving nearly 2700 lives that day, though not his own. Heart of a Soldier, with a libretto by Donna Di Novelli, premiered at San Francisco Opera in 2011 \u2014 on the eve of the 10th anniversary of Sept. 11.  In 2010, Houston Grand Opera gave the world premiere of To Cross the Face of the Moon, which was billed the first mariachi opera. It is the story of three generations in a Mexican-American family that explores issues of self-identity and the pain of migration. Since the premiere of this opera by Jos\u00e9 \"Pepe\" Mart\u00ednez (who has led the Mariachi Vargas de Tecalitl\u00e1n since 1975), it has played in Paris at the Theatre Chatelet and will go to Chicago's Lyric Opera in April 2013.  \"News has a kind of mystery\": one of the most famous lines from 20th-century opera. This collaboration between composer John Adams, librettist Alice Goodman and director Peter Sellars (which also premiered in Houston) manages to dig into the nuances and ironies of some of history's most complicated actors, from President Nixon to Madame Mao. It has been recorded twice and the 2011 Metropolitan Opera production will appear Nov. 19 on Blu-ray and DVD.  Jake Heggie's beautiful 2000 opera Dead Man Walking is based on the true story \u2014 and the Oscar-winning film \u2014 about a man sentenced to death row in Louisiana and the Catholic nun who became his spiritual advisor. Against all odds, but entirely to the credit of Heggie and his musical champions, it looks like this one is entering the repertory. Not only has it been recorded twice, but it's been staged by more than two dozen companies around the world, with performances on the way in the next two years in Montreal, Boston, Eugene, Ore., Tulsa, Okla. and Dresden, Germany.  Even though this election continues to hinge on \"the economy, stupid,\" there frankly hasn't been a good recent operatic elucidation of this topic. (Has there? Readers, tell us what we don't know.) So we'll look back to Aaron Copland's 1954 work The Tender Land, which was inspired by both Walker Evans' Depression-era photography and Evans' collaboration with James Agee, Let Us Now Praise Famous Men. Today the orchestral suite (excerpted here) is heard more often than sung excerpts from the opera.",

Uri Friedman is an associate editor at Foreign Policy. On the campaign trail, Mitt Romney contrasts his vision of American greatness with what he claims is Barack Obama's proclivity for apologizing for it. The \"president doesn't have the same feelings about American exceptionalism that we do,\" Romney has charged. All countries have their own brand of chest-thumping nationalism, but almost none is as patently universal \u2014 even messianic \u2014 as this belief in America's special character and role in the world. While the mission may be centuries old, the phrase only recently entered the political lexicon, after it was first uttered by none other than Joseph Stalin. Today the term is experiencing a resurgence in an age of anxiety about American decline. 1630 As the Massachusetts Bay Company sets sail from England to the New World, Puritan lawyer John Winthrop urges his fellow passengers on the Arabella to \"be as a city upon a hill,\" alluding to a phrase from Jesus's Sermon on the Mount. The colonists must make New England a model for future settlements, he notes, as the \"eyes of all people are upon us.\" 1776 In \"Common Sense,\" revolutionary pamphleteer Thomas Paine describes America as a beacon of liberty for the world. \"Freedom hath been hunted round the globe,\" he explains. \"Asia, and Africa, have long expelled her. Europe regards her like a stranger, and England hath given her warning to depart. O! receive the fugitive, and prepare in time an asylum for mankind.\" 1840 Reflecting on his travels in the United States in his seminal work, Democracy in America, French intellectual Alexis de Tocqueville writes that the \"position of the Americans\" is \"quite exceptional, and it may be believed that no democratic people will ever be placed in a similar one.\" 1898  \"There is but a single specialty with us, only one thing that can be called by the wide name 'American.' That is the national devotion to ice-water.... I suppose we do stand alone in having a drink that nobody likes but ourselves.\" --Mark Twain 1914 U.S. President Woodrow Wilson infuses Paine's notion of the United States as a bastion of freedom with missionary zeal, arguing that what makes America unique is its duty to spread liberty abroad. \"I want you to take these great engines of force out onto the seas like adventurers enlisted for the elevation of the spirit of the human race,\" Wilson tells U.S. Naval Academy graduates. \"For that is the only distinction that America has.\" 1929-1930 Coining a new term, Soviet leader Joseph Stalin condemns the \"heresy of American exceptionalism\" while expelling American communist leader Jay Lovestone and his followers from the Communist International for arguing that U.S. capitalism constitutes an exception to Marxism's universal laws. Within a year, the Communist Party USA has adopted Stalin's disparaging term. \"The storm of the economic crisis in the United States blew down the house of cards of American exceptionalism,\" the party declares, gloating about the Great Depression. 1941 Echoing Wilson, magazine publisher Henry Luce urges the United States to enter World War II and exchange isolationism for an \"American century\" in which it acts as the \"powerhouse\" of those ideals that are \"especially American.\" 1950s A group of American historians \u2014 including Daniel Boorstin, Louis Hartz, Richard Hofstadter, and David Potter \u2014 argues that the United States forged a \"consensus\" of liberal values over time that enabled it to sidestep movements such as fascism and socialism. But they question whether this unique national character can be reproduced elsewhere. As Boorstin writes, \"nothing could be more un-American than to urge other countries to imitate America.\" 1961 President John F. Kennedy suggests that America's distinctiveness stems from its determination to exemplify and defend freedom all over the world. He invokes Winthrop's \"city upon a hill\" and declares: \"More than any other people on Earth, we bear burdens and accept risks unprecedented in their size and their duration, not for ourselves alone but for all who wish to be free.\" 1980 Ronald Reagan counters President Jimmy Carter's rhetoric about a national \"crisis of confidence\" with paeans to American greatness during the presidential campaign. \"I've always believed that this blessed land was set apart in a special way,\" Reagan later explains. 1989 The final days of the Cold War raise the prospect that the American model could become the norm, not the exception. \"What we may be witnessing is not just the end of the Cold War\" but the \"end of history as such, that is ... the universalization of Western liberal democracy as the final form of human government,\" political scientist Francis Fukuyama famously proclaims. In my mind it was a tall, proud city built on rocks stronger than oceans, wind-swept, God-blessed, and teeming with people of all kinds living in harmony and peace.\" --Ronald Reagan 1996 In a speech justifying NATO's intervention in Bosnia, President Bill Clinton declares that \"America remains the indispensable nation\" and that \"there are times when America, and only America, can make a difference between war and peace, between freedom and repression.\" 2000 American exceptionalism becomes a partisan talking point as future George W. Bush speechwriter Marc Thiessan, in a Weekly Standard article, contends that there are two competing visions of internationalism in the 21st century: the \"'global multilateralism' of the Clinton-Gore Democrats\" vs. the \"'American exceptionalism' of the Reagan-Bush Republicans.\" 2004 \"Like generations before us, we have a calling from beyond the stars to stand for freedom. This is the everlasting dream of America.\" --George W. Bush 2007-2008 Amid skepticism about America's global leadership, fueled by a disastrous war in Iraq and the global financial crisis, Democrat Barack Obama runs against Bush's muscular \"Freedom Agenda\" in the election to succeed him. \"I believe in American exceptionalism,\" Obama says, but not one based on \"our military prowess or our economic dominance.\" Democratic pollster Mark Penn advises Hillary Clinton to target Obama's \"lack of American roots\" in the primary by \"explicitly own[ing] 'American'\" in her campaign. 2009 As critical scholarship \u2014 such as Godfrey Hodgson's The Myth of American Exceptionalism \u2014 proliferates, Obama becomes the first sitting U.S. president to use the phrase \"American exceptionalism\" publicly. \"I suspect that the Brits believe in British exceptionalism and the Greeks believe in Greek exceptionalism\" \u2014 a line later much quoted by Republicans eager to prove his disdain for American uniqueness. 2010 80 percent of Americans believe the United States \"has a unique character that makes it the greatest country in the world.\" But only 58 percent think Obama agrees. --USA Today/Gallup poll 2011-2012 With the presidential race heating up, the phrase gets reduced to a shorthand for \"who loves America more.\" After making the \"case for American greatness\" in his 2010 book No Apology, GOP candidate Mitt Romney claims Obama believes \"America's just another nation with a flag.\" The president, for his part, invokes Bill Clinton's \"indispensable nation\" in his State of the Union address and later declares, in response to Republican critics, \"My entire career has been a testimony to American exceptionalism.\" If Stalin only knew what he started.",

            "article_content": "Much of the French presidential campaign has played out on the far right, around the issues of security and crime and immigration. Even President Nicolas Sarkozy has spoken of limiting immigration and deporting foreigners. NPR's Eleanor Beardsley visited a French town still haunted by ghosts of its far-right past.  SCOTT SIMON, HOST: Voters go to the polls tomorrow in France to cast ballots in the first round of their presidential election. President Nicolas Sarkozy still trails his socialist opponent Francois Hollande. Mr. Sarkozy has tried to close that gap by appealing to voters on the right. Much of the French campaign this time around focused on right-wing issues like crime, security and immigration. NPR's Eleanor Beardsley visited a town in France that is still haunted by ghosts of its far-right past, to see what people think about that. (SOUNDBITE OF RUNNING WATER) ELEANOR BEARDSLEY, BYLINE: Since Roman times, the French town of Vichy has been famous for its hot springs like this one bubbling up in the center of town. Known as the Queen of Spas, from the 18th century on, Vichy attracted people from across the globe who took to its waters to cure their ailments. But in 1940, the town's fortunes changed. PHILIPPE GENDRE: This is the Hotel du Parc and this is at the third floor that Marshal Petain was working. BEARDSLEY: That's Vichy tourism office director Philippe Gendre. He's speaking of Marshal Philippe Petain, the head of the French wartime government that collaborated with the Nazis. Gendre says Petain's choice of Vichy for his headquarters was purely logistical. The city had enormous hotel capacity and one of the most modern telephone systems of that time. The war years left an indelible stain on the town, says Gendre. GENDRE: We've came from a very romantic city, and now for some people, we are the place where a black spot of history was made. (SOUNDBITE OF MALE VOICE) BEARDSLEY: On this morning in Vichy, a group of supporters of far right National Front Party candidate Marine Le Pen is stuffing mailboxes with leaflets. David Salvan is head of the party's Vichy chapter. He says there are absolutely no parallels to draw between Petain and Le Pen. DAVID SALVAN: (Through Translator) There were extremists in our party in the past. And it was a burden. But that's changed over the last few decades, and especially since Marine Le Pen has taken over leadership from her father. She is fighting for the French nation, not for nationalism. That's different. BEARDSLEY: It's the first presidential race for the fiery, Marine Le Pen, a divorced mother of three who is credited with modernizing the National Front and bringing it into the mainstream by breaking with the macho, traditionalist world of far-right politics. SALVAN: (French spoken) BEARDSLEY: While restricting immigration remains one of the party's main planks, Salvan says its economic goals are what's most important: creating jobs, bringing French industry back home and quitting the euro currency so France can take back its sovereignty from the ratings agencies. (SOUNDBITE OF DOOR OPENING) BEARDSLEY: Bonjour, Monsieur Mayor. MAYOR CLAUDE MALHURET: Bonjour. BEARDSLEY: Claude Malhuret is the mayor of Vichy. He says the far-right is no stronger here than anywhere else in France. But he admits that Vichy is always on guard. For example, people here still bristle when the wartime government is referred to as the Vichy regime, instead of the Petain regime. MALHURET: Yes, of course, this has been digested exactly to the same proportion that it has been digested in France. And, as you know, this period of our history has not been digested completely today. BEARDSLEY: In spite of the mass deportations under the Petain government, today France has Europe's largest Jewish population. It also has Western Europe's largest Muslim community and sometimes the Middle East conflict echoes here. In March, a confessed Islamist extremist of Algerian origin shot and killed three Jewish children and a teacher in the city of Toulouse. That tragedy pushed the campaign further to the right. (SOUNDBITE OF KEYS OPENING DOORS) BEARDSLEY: Michele London, a prominent member of Vichy's Jewish community, opens the door to the city's synagogue. She was born in the French colony of Algeria in 1946. She says she has great memories of coming to this spa town with her parents when she was a girl. MICHELE LONDON: (Through Translator) People came every year from the North African colonies and we had am image of Vichy as a fun-loving vacation place with the casinos, the opera and the spa. The war interrupted that. BEARDSLEY: London says Jews from North Africa returned to vacation and eventually settled in Vichy when the French colonies gained independence. LONDON: (Foreign language spoken) BEARDSLEY: London says relations between Muslims and Jews in Vichy, and in France in general are good. She says she was heartened by the huge outpouring of solidarity in France after the Toulouse killings. London says the country's most important value is its strict adherence to secularism. Separating public life from religion is what allows us to respect each other and live together, she says. And no matter who wins the election, that will never be compromised.

            "article_content": "Secretary of State Hillary Clinton is in China as part of her six-nation Asia trip. Despite mounting tensions, Clinton emphasized mutual cooperation and strong ties as she visited Beijing.  DAVID GREENE, HOST: Secretary of State Hillary Clinton has been visiting Chinese officials, talking of mutual cooperation, despite a lot of tension. So far her visit to Beijing has produced no breakdowns but also no breakthroughs. Here's NPR's Louisa Lim. LOUISA LIM, BYLINE: There were smiles as Clinton met China's president, Hu Jintao. But for the past few days, China's state-run media have been in full flow against her. Hillary Reinforces U.S.-China Mistrust was one headline. Today, any sniping there might have been stayed behind closed doors. Constructive and productive was how both sides characterized meetings between the foreign ministers. Clinton shrugged off the personal attacks on her. SECRETARY HILLARY CLINTON: We are going to have critics in both of our countries who are going to second-guess decisions that we are making. But I feel strongly that we are on the right track in building a positive, cooperative, comprehensive relationship for the 21st century. LIM: Tensions have been building, especially over territorial disputes. China claims much of the South China Sea, pitting it against the Vietnam, the Philippines and other Southeast Asian countries. Washington says it doesn't take sides but has an interest in protecting the freedom of navigation. Today, Chinese Foreign Minister Yang Jiechi gave assurances about the freedom of navigation. YANG JIECHI: (Through translator) For China and our neighboring countries, the South China Sea is really a lifeline for exchanges, trade and commerce. There is no issue currently in this area, nor will there ever be issues in that area in the future. LIM: In July, with much fanfare, China announced the formation of a new city, Sansha, to administer disputed islands in the South China Sea. The U.S. expressed concern. Tensions have also built over islands in the East China Sea, also claimed by Japan. China calls them Diaoyu; Japan, Senkaku. The State Department waded into the debate when spokeswoman Victoria Newland used the Japanese name. VICTORIA NEWLAND: We call them the Senkaku. So if that's the question that you're asking, we don't take a position on them, though, as I said all the way through. UNIDENTIFIED MAN: So you don't take a position on them but on the other hand... LIM: That Chinese reporter's persistence made him a folk hero on the Chinese Internet, where nationalism looms large and many see the U.S. as meddling. There's concern about the U.S. pivot to Asia and whether it's aimed at containing China. Wang Zheng from Seton Hall University researches Chinese foreign policy. He says Clinton's focus on the region has made her unpopular. WANG ZHENG: Some of the Chinese people, they have this kind of conspiracy theory that Hillary Clinton is visiting just all these neighboring countries of China, and they're trying to somehow push them to unite against China. LIM: Today, one mantra was invoked repeatedly by both sides. We cannot see eye-to-eye on everything but at least we can discuss our differences. Given the domestic political imperatives of the U.S. election and the Chinese transition of power, those differences may yet become magnified in the months to come. Louisa Lim, NPR News, Beijing.

For Americans living along the border, the future of Mexico affects their bottom line.  STEVE INSKEEP, HOST: In southern Texas and in Arizona, people are paying a lot of attention to the presidential election - Mexico's presidential election. From member station KJZZ, Peter O'Dowd explains why millions of Americans are awaiting July 1st, Mexico's election day. PETER O'DOWD, BYLINE: Stand on the edge of this unfinished railroad bridge outside of Brownsville, Texas, and you can see across the Rio Grande into Mexico. It's the first bridge of its kind to connect the countries in a century. And for businessman John Wood, it's a symbol of the way lives connect along the border. JOHN WOOD: We are tied together. It's kind of like an umbilical cord. O'DOWD: Texas does more business with its southern neighbor than any other state. And that's a big reason why Wood says Mexico's upcoming election means as much to him as the November contest here. WOOD: If Mexico isn't doing well, it doesn't seem to be a whole of difference what's happening in Washington. O'DOWD: Wood says the next president could help make Mexico well again. A more stable and calmer Mexico would mean more investment and more jobs in Brownsville. WOOD: A better life for, not only me, but for everyone who lives in the area. O'DOWD: Some Americans along the border have a huge stake in Mexican politics. The Woodrow Wilson Center estimates the two countries traded a record half-a-trillion dollars in goods and services last year. Investment fell off during the recession, but has steadily climbed back despite escalating drug violence. Analysts say business would strengthen even more if Mexico solved its cartel problem. UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN: (Foreign language spoken) O'DOWD: That's absolutely right, according to Daniel Hong. He owns this general goods store a few yards from Brownsville's port. Hong says sales have dropped 60 percent in recent years, and it doesn't have much to do with the economy. DANIEL HONG: My clientele are mostly Mexican nationals. If they're afraid to leave their houses, I'm not going to have customers - simply put. O'DOWD: So Hong has an opinion on the election. On a personal level, he supports the National Action Party, or the PAN, and the continuation of President Felipe Calderon's drug-war offensive. But on a business level, he supports the PRI. The Institutional Revolutionary Party ran Mexico for 71 years and kept relative peace, analysts say, by turning a blind eye to the cartels. HONG: They will give, you know, the Northern Mexico States a little bit more calm. A little bit more tranquility and that leads to more people coming over, which leads to more sales. O'DOWD: And that is the heart of this election, according to Tony Zavaleta. He directs the Center for Border and Transnational Studies at the University of Texas, Brownsville. TONY ZAVALETA: The election of the president is a referendum on who best can return Mexico to normal. O'DOWD: Zavaleta says normalcy is important to the psyche of the entire border community; it's not just businesses with ties to both countries. Its Americans, like him, who see Mexico as a second home, as a place where friends and families live. ZAVALETA: We live with one foot in each country all the time. I know it can get better. We have to hope that this election will set it on the right track to getting better. (SOUNDBITE OF TRUCKS RUMBLING DOWN ROAD) O'DOWD: More than a thousand miles to the west, in Nogales, Arizona, a line of commercial trucks rumbles toward the Mariposa crossing. Trucks like these are a common sight in this desert border town. Nearly five billion pounds of grapes, peppers, tomatoes and other fresh produce moved through last year. Some of it belonged to Gerardo Ritz. His family owns farms in the Mexican State of Sinaloa. Ritz runs the business side from Arizona. With literally a foot in both worlds, Ritz also closely watches the security debate in Mexico. GERARDO RITZ: It's something that makes our business pretty much stay in business, and keeps us, as an American entity, investing in Mexico. O'DOWD: Ritz says military checkpoints on Mexican highways keeps his produce safe on its journey north. He credits Calderon's offensive against the cartels. And he expects Mexico's next president to keep it up. RITZ: We don't want to see organized crime getting into the produce business. In my opinion, whoever runs the country for the next six years has got to continue. O'DOWD: As a Mexican national, Ritz won't say which candidate he'll vote for July 1st. But on Election Day, he'll be like many others in the U.S. looking south toward Mexico. For NPR News, I'm Peter O'Dowd. INSKEEP: It's MORNING EDITION from NPR News. Copyright \u00a9 2012 NPR.

Republicans have been quick to criticize the president for bypassing Congress with his immigration action, but they've been unusually silent on the policy itself.\n                \n                    \n                    J. Scott Applewhite/AP\n                    \n                \nhide caption House Speaker John Boehner, R-Ohio (left) and Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., on Capitol Hill in February. Republicans have been quick to criticize the president for bypassing Congress with his immigration action, but they've been unusually silent on the policy itself. Nearly a week has gone by since President Obama announced a new immigration policy that could halt the deportation of some 800,000 young people brought to the country illegally. While Republicans on Capitol Hill were quick to criticize the president for bypassing Congress, they've been unusually silent on the question of whether these illegal immigrants should be getting such a break. Republicans appear reluctant to get ahead of GOP presidential candidate Mitt Romney on a key issue for Latinos, whose support for Romney remains uncertain. Waiting For Romney As leader of the Senate Republicans, Mitch McConnell of Kentucky normally is not shy about publicly scolding Obama. But neither he nor any other Republican has uttered a single word on the Senate floor about the president's executive action. Asked by reporters why he's said nothing about the issue, McConnell replied that Romney would be talking about it Thursday at a meeting of the National Association of Latino Elected and Appointed Officials in Orlando. \"We're going to wait and see what Gov. Romney has to say and then our members are going to be discussing his views on this. And I think many of them will have similar views; others may not,\" he said. Romney himself has not made clear where he stands on the president's action. Late last year at a town hall meeting in Le Mars, Iowa, Romney did make it clear he was against the DREAM Act \u2014 legislation that would provide a path to citizenship for people brought as children to the country illegally by their parents. \"The question is: If I were elected and Congress were to pass the DREAM Act, would I veto it? And the answer is yes,\" Romney said.  But on Sunday, in an interview on CBS's Face The Nation, Romney seemed to soften his hard-line stance. \"With regards to these kids who were brought in by their parents through no fault of their own, there needs to be a long-term solution so they know what their status is,\" Romney said. Romney is well aware that the deportation of young immigrants is a big issue for Latino voters, and he was overheard a few weeks ago telling Republicans that if Latinos failed to embrace his candidacy for president, it \"spells doom for us.\" Grumbling On Both Sides Obama's move on immigration appears to have caught Romney and many other Republicans by surprise. House Speaker John Boehner, R-Ohio, said Obama's move \"puts everyone in a difficult position.\" Only a few weeks ago, Boehner dismissed the possibility of taking up the DREAM Act before the elections. \"I think we all have concerns for those who are caught in this trap, who through no fault of their own are here, but the president's actions are going to make it much more difficult for us to work in a bipartisan way to get to a permanent solution,\" Boehner said. Democrats say Republicans have done nothing but stand in the way of getting the DREAM Act passed. Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nev., said now is not the time to walk away from the DREAM Act. \"But that's exactly what Republicans are doing. They're taking their marbles and saying, 'Well, OK, we'll just quit and go home,' \" Reid said. \"They've never been here anyway to go home. They haven't helped us anyway.\" Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., had been talking about introducing a somewhat less generous version of the DREAM Act. On Monday, he said he would no longer pursue that. But when asked Wednesday whether he would offer such legislation before the election, Rubio seemed to have had a change of heart. \"We'll see. I need to figure out what willingness there is to continue to focus on the issue now that the sense of urgency's been taken away. So, I hope so but I'm not sure,\" Rubio said. Politics Over Policy? Other Republicans say Obama is the one who failed to make good on a campaign promise to push through a comprehensive immigration overhaul his first year in office. Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., said that never happened, \"so now for him to turn around, just a few months before the election for obvious political reasons and take this step is something that American people should be skeptical about.\" For his part, Reid was asked by a reporter whether he would bring up the DREAM Act in the Senate before the election to get senators on the record. \"I don't want to answer that question. That's a clown question, bro,\" Reid said, stealing a phrase from Washington Nationals outfielder Bryce Harper. As Reid knows well, some vulnerable Democrats are also uneasy when it comes to immigration.",

            "article_content": "After African-American and Latino voters turned out in record numbers to reelect President Obama, leaders for both groups are turning up the pressure on him to return the favor. They say that minorities, who put aside their disappointments with Obama's first term to support him again, now expect the president to spend his political capital on policies that will help their communities begin to recover from the recession. In the post-election euphoria, some leaders claim, certain voters are saying, \"It's our turn.\" \"I hear that everywhere I go,\" says Rep. Emanuel Cleaver, D-Mo., outgoing chairman of the Congressional Black Caucus. \"You're hearing it from African-Americans and Latinos, including Latinos [in Congress] here on the Hill. ... I'm already trying to figure out how to respond to that \u2014 'Well, we're the ones who pulled him over the top in Ohio, we're the ones who pulled him over in Florida. You owe us.' \" The National Urban League's Marc Morial (center) joins other civic leaders speaking outside the White House after they met with President Obama last month.\n                \n                    \n                    Toby Jorrin/AFP/Getty Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption The National Urban League's Marc Morial (center) joins other civic leaders speaking outside the White House after they met with President Obama last month. On Monday, nearly 60 black leaders held a closed-door meeting in Washington to begin crafting an agenda to be delivered to the White House and Congress early next year. The leaders said the policies will be culled from five areas: economic inequality, education, health care, criminal justice and voting rights. \"Against the backdrop of high unemployment, a difficult set of economic challenges, a great deal of hope and promise that we have in our president's second term, we felt it was important for us to come together,\" Marc Morial, president of the National Urban League, told reporters after the meeting. Morial's organization, along with the NAACP, the National Coalition on Black Civic Participation and the National Action Network, convened the event. As the economy has slowly improved, the fortunes of many blacks and Latinos remain stalled. The nation's unemployment rate dropped in November to 7.7 percent, but remained at 10 percent for Hispanics and fell a percentage point, to 13.2 percent, for blacks. A Mandate To Serve All Obama's economic policies have been criticized from all quarters. But as the nation's first black president, he has faced lingering questions about his commitment to address the needs of minorities, especially through the use of targeted measures. Responding to those concerns, Obama told Black Enterprise magazine: \"I'm not the president of black America. I'm the president of the United States of America.\" Obama has favored broader programs designed to address economic conditions for all Americans. However, he has taken political risks on behalf of other core supporters, such as gays and lesbians. He ordered the Justice Department to stop defending the constitutionality of the Defense of Marriage Act. He ended the military's \"don't ask, don't tell\" policy, which banned gays and lesbians from serving openly, and he announced his support for same-sex marriage. The moves energized the lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender community. This summer he solidified his support with Latinos by halting the deportations of young illegal immigrants. Blacks, having invested great stock in the re-election of one of their own, now hope he will turn to more of their concerns. \"I do think there are heightened expectations. But I think people will figure out very quickly if that expectation is real or not, based on how he behaves,\" says Emory University political scientist Andra Gillespie, author of the book, The New Black Politician: Cory Booker, Newark, and Post-Racial America. \"I think everybody is kind of waiting with baited breath to see how he responds to the lack of a re-election imperative. This is where we may see what President Obama is made of.\" Spending 'Political Capital' For Latinos, the November election has sparked momentum for their top issue, immigration. Congressional Republicans have since embraced immigration reform as a priority. Bipartisan talks are under way in the House on legislation that could be introduced early next year. Obama has said Congress should \"seize the moment,\" yet Latino leaders insist that voters have given the president a mandate to lead the effort. Some Latino leaders believe Obama should have fought more aggressively to push the DREAM Act through Congress in 2010. (The bill would have established a path to citizenship for young people brought to the United States as children who attend college or serve in the military.) I think everybody is kind of waiting with baited breath to see how he responds to the lack of a re-election imperative. This is where we may see what President Obama is made of. Andra Gillespie, Emory University political scientist Latinos also criticized the Obama administration, before it changed its policy, for deporting a record 1.1 million people in three years. \"Not only the president but others have said in the past, 'How much political capital do we need to spend on this issue?' Everybody understands now that you need to spend all of it,\" says Rep. Luis Gutierrez, D-Ill. \"With the same vigor and energy that Latino people voted for this president, he should do this.\" For African-American groups, it's not so simple as identifying a single priority. Many of them separately advocate for policies that address such issues as disproportionately high unemployment, low student achievement and high incarceration rates. They also have differed about publicly criticizing Obama and whether doing so provides fodder for conservatives and weakens the president politically. Cleaver and other black politicians acknowledge tamping down their criticisms this year to avoid endangering the president's re-election chances. Scholar and activist Cornel West, a former Obama supporter, is one of the few prominent blacks who have remained outspoken critics. Shortly after the election, West said he was \"glad there was not a right-wing takeover, but we end up with a Republican, a Rockefeller Republican in blackface, with Barack Obama, so that our struggle with regard to poverty intensifies.\" In response to criticism, the White House has more aggressively promoted the positive impact that Obama's policies have had on blacks, such as increased funding for historically black colleges and universities and for Pell Grants for college students, and the Affordable Care Act. (Blacks and Latinos make up an estimated 50 percent of the uninsured.) But even some Obama supporters say his broad policies must be more narrowly tailored. Ron Busby, president of U.S. Black Chamber Inc., which represents business owners, says most black companies aren't large enough to qualify for many of the loans issued by the Small Business Administration. Busby, who served on a committee that advised the Obama campaign on business policy, decries the decline under the Obama administration in the number of federal government contracts awarded to black vendors. \"You can say rising tide floats all boats, and that's great to say if we're all in the same boat. But we're not. My boat,\" Busby says, referring to black businesses, \"is sinking.\" As a practical matter, there is wide agreement that a \"black\" or \"Latino\" agenda from Obama supporters has little chance of passing the Republican-controlled House, particularly if it would increase spending. One idea discussed at the Monday meeting was the shaping of \"race-neutral\" programs aimed at communities with sustained high joblessness. Such measures were included in the president's jobs bill that failed in the House last year.",

            "article_content": "Republican Senators Kay Bailey Hutchison and Jon Kyl held a news conference urging immigration reform on Tuesday. Both are retiring from the Senate next month and both are from red states that could turn blue in the next decade as more and more Latinos become citizens and voters.  ROBERT SIEGEL, HOST: From NPR News, this is ALL THINGS CONSIDERED. I'm Robert Siegel. MELISSA BLOCK, HOST: I'm Melissa Block. And we begin this hour with talk of immigration reform. Dealing with the estimated 12 million immigrants now in the U.S. illegally has long been a priority, primarily of Democrats. Three weeks ago, Latinos voted overwhelmingly for President Obama. As NPR's David Welna reports, Senate Republicans weighed in today, unveiling legislation that would give some undocumented immigrants a path to legal status. DAVID WELNA, BYLINE: It was two border state and soon-to-be-retiring Republican Senators who introduced what they're calling the Achieve Act. Arizona's Jon Kyl said it aims to get the ball rolling on immigration. (SOUNDBITE OF SPEECH) WELNA: The GOP proposal, in many ways, parallels the so-called Dream Act sponsored by Democrats and blocked repeatedly by Republicans. Both would allow children brought into the country illegally by their parents to stay. But Texas Republican Kay Bailey Hutchison says the bill she's cosponsoring has stricter requirements. (SOUNDBITE OF SPEECH) WELNA: Asked whether Republicans were rushing this legislation out in response to their poor showing among Latinos, Arizona's Kyl denied having electoral motives. (SOUNDBITE OF SPEECH) WELNA: University of Washington political scientist Matt Baretto is cofounder of the polling firm Latino Decisions. He doubts GOP claims that the election has nothing to do with the party's new push on immigration. MATT BARETTO: If they had been working on this for a long time, we would have seen this bill in the House or the Senate years ago. And I think the election results sent a very clear message to Republicans - and especially those from states with large Latino populations - that they need to have smarter solutions on immigration. WELNA: Still, at a House reception today for Mexico's president-elect, Enrique Pena Nieto, no Republican leader showed up. California House Democrat Xavier Becerra was there, and he welcomes today's move by Senate Republicans on immigration. REPRESENTATIVE XAVIER BECERRA: It's good that Republicans are beginning to talk about immigration reform, and so let's get it done. If they've got some ideas, great, let's move forward. We can get this done, the whole package, this coming year. WELNA: South Carolina Republican Senator Lindsey Graham - who's been pushing a broader immigration reform package off and on in the last several years - also hailed this latest initiative. SENATOR LINDSEY GRAHAM: I think it's good for the country to get this issue solved. I just hope that, in a bipartisan way, we can fix broken borders, control who comes here to get a job and deal with the 12 million in a firm, fair way and not have 12 million 20 years from now, get a permanent fix. If we don't, we're letting the country down. WELNA: Graham's worked with New York Democratic Senator Charles Schumer on immigration. Schumer says the bill rolled out today falls far short of what's needed. (SOUNDBITE OF SPEECH) WELNA: Lawmakers from both parties agreed there's little chance of anything being done on immigration before the new Congress begins in January. By then, both of the sponsors of today's proposal will have retired. David Welna, NPR News, the Capitol. Copyright \u00a9 2012 NPR.  All rights reserved.

            "article_content": "Melissa Block talks to Mara Liasson for an overview of what Tuesday's election means.  MELISSA BLOCK, HOST: Karen just mentioned a coalition of races and ethnicities that re-elected President Obama. And there's a lot to say, one day after the election, about race and the changing demographics that helped the president win. NPR national political correspondent Mara Liasson is here to talk more about that. Hey, Mara. MARA LIASSON, BYLINE: Hello. Nice to be here. BLOCK: Mara, we see in the exit polls that President Obama lost white voters by 20 points. The spread was 39-59. How are Democrats and Republicans interpreting that demographic breakdown in the vote? LIASSON: Well, demographics is kind of the number one topic today as the parties, particularly the Republicans, shifts through the rubble of Tuesday night and figure out what are the lessons learned for them. Mitt Romney did about as well with white voters as any previous Republican seeking the White House. He got close to 60 percent. He kind of maxed out among white people. The problem is that in - among the Hispanic vote, for instance, he only got 27 percent, less than 30 percent. So the white vote is shrinking. It went from 74 percent of the electorate in 2008 to 72 percent this year. But the Hispanic vote grew from nine percent in 2008 to 10 percent this year. Black votes stayed the same. So he's getting a bigger and bigger market share in a shrinking market. And that's not sustainable over the long term, and Republicans obviously want to do something about that. BLOCK: Do something about that. And what exactly is on the table for what they should do about it? LIASSON: Well, there's a lot of talk about whether this was a problem unique to Mitt Romney, is it a problem that's structural with the party, do they have to merely change their tone when they talk about Hispanics, or do they actually have to embrace a different kinds of immigration policies? I think once Mitt Romney made the decision - and he did make a choice in the primaries to go hard right on immigration, talk about self deportation, which is something that he just could not erase in the minds of Hispanic voters, he made a choice that was hard to change in a general election. Rick Perry, Newt Gingrich, not all Republican candidates decided to go in that direction. So some people think the Republicans need to make a deal on immigration legislation that will be coming up next year, whether it's the DREAM Act or something more comprehensive. Other people think it's just the candidate. Once you have Marco Rubio, for instance, running for president, he'll be able to paint a different face - put a different face on the Republican Party for Hispanic voters. BLOCK: You mentioned Marco Rubio from Florida. Are other rising stars within the Republican Party who might be leading this effort to make the party more inclusive bring in more Latino votes, for example? LIASSON: Well, there are a lot of candidates for that. Marco Rubio is clearly the most prominent Hispanic elected official, and he will be a leader on immigration and all Hispanic issues for the Republicans. But Brian Sandoval, Susanna Martinez - two Southwestern governors - they're also considered to be rising stars. BLOCK: Nevada and New Mexico. LIASSON: Nevada and New Mexico. Also, you've got people who's - like Jeb Bush. He's not a Hispanic, but he's been a very prominent voice for an inclusive approach to immigration and Latinos in the Republican Party. BLOCK: And on the Democrat side, what are they going to be doing to try to hold their advantage, both among Latinos and the other coalitions that kept President Obama in office? LIASSON: Well, one of the most remarkable things about what happened last night was that the Democrats kept their coalition. And it is a majority coalition. They kept them even against all the headwinds. In other words, this was a bad economy, the euphoria and the novelty of 2008, the Obama campaign was gone, they still got their voters to the polls. They think they're just going to keep on doing the same thing. They're going to try to deliver on immigration reform. This is something that the president promised but failed to deliver on in his first term. They also have the advantage of a lot of Hispanic voters are young. And these are voters who are going to the polls for the first time, the second time. They're getting their voting habits ingrained and, not unlike the Democrats in previous generations, created a coalition of immigrant groups. That's what the Democrats hope that they can do now. BLOCK: And replicate the next time. LIASSON: Yes. And they replicated it twice now. There's no reason to think that they can't continue to do that. BLOCK: OK. NPR's Mara Liasson. Mara, thanks so much. LIASSON: Thank you. Copyright \u00a9 2012 NPR.  All rights reserved.  Visit our website terms of use and permissions pages at www.npr.org for further information.

Swing states \u2014 Ohio, Virginia, Michigan, Iowa, Wisconsin, Nevada, Colorado, New Hampshire \u2014 viewed as tossups a day before the voting fell without much fight into the blue column. Only North Carolina went for Romney. How did the Obama campaign pull it off? It came down to a mixture of demographics, superior organization and a few tactical missteps from Republicans, political observers tell NPR. George C. Edwards III, a professor of political science at Texas A&M University, says organization was first and foremost. Edwards discounts the superPAC-fueled, billion-dollar ad blitz, with one exception. \"There was a time in the summer,\" he says, \"when the Obama campaign got the upper hand on the ad wars, but for the most part it was about other things.\" Things like grass-roots infrastructure. \"The Obama campaign had many more field offices than [Mitt] Romney, and they had many more people on the ground, knocking on doors,\" he says. \"That seems to be the key to turnout, and Obama's people are just better at it.\" The president's base came out in force. In most of the battleground states, blacks and Latinos supplied the margin of victory, says John Geer, a professor of presidential politics and public opinion at Vanderbilt University. African-Americans showed up in astonishing numbers, matching or exceeding the record turnout in 2008, Geer says. And he notes that Romney's harsh rhetoric on immigration issues didn't sit well with Latinos, who overwhelmingly support the DREAM Act, backed by President Obama, to allow children of illegal immigrants a path to citizenship. Jonathan Turley, a political scientist at George Washington University, agrees. \"The simple answer is that the Democrats did much better with voters of color,\" he says. Controversial statements in U.S. Senate races in Missouri and Indiana also had a surprising impact in the final weeks of the campaign. Turley says candidates Richard Mourdock in Indiana and Todd Akin in Missouri both made inflammatory remarks about rape that the Obama campaign was able to seize on and elevate to the national stage. \"I think this is one election where candidates lower on the ballot actually had national impact,\" he says. Here's a quick look at the decisive factors in some battleground states: Florida, Nevada And Colorado The Latino vote made a difference in all three states. Many pollsters showed Florida leaning toward Romney immediately ahead of the voting. But the state, while technically not decided, is where Republican weakness among Latinos was most telling, Geer notes. \"Most people thought Romney would capture Florida, but that's partly because the polls have a hard time recording the Latino vote at times, because they tend to be cellphone-based,\" he says. Exit polls showed the president capturing 60 percent of the Latino vote (compared with 57 percent in 2008) to Romney's 32 percent. \"During the primary, most of the Republican candidates took very strong anti-immigrant stances, and that hurt them going into the general election,\" says Texas A&M's Edwards. That also proved to be the case in Nevada and Colorado. \"In a state like Nevada, you've got bad times and bad times for Hispanics when it comes to job losses,\" Geer says. \"But nonetheless, the demographics were pretty strongly in favor of Obama. The Pew Hispanic Center notes that nearly 270,000 Latinos were eligible to vote in Nevada. A pre-election poll commissioned by America's Voice, a Washington, D.C.-based immigration advocacy group, found that 69 percent of Latinos surveyed in the state backed Obama versus 15 percent for Romney. A Denver Post poll showed a wide margin of support for Obama in Colorado. Ohio And Michigan We can lump these two states together with one phrase: \"auto bailout,\" says Turley, of George Washington University, who notes that Obama made the case that he saved the auto industry, so vital to Michigan and Ohio, while Romney wanted to \"let Detroit go bankrupt.\" \"The Obama campaign did a great job of selecting one part of the economy \u2014 its bailout of the auto industry \u2014 to highlight as a success,\" Turley says. \"Romney argued about the entire economy, and Obama's campaign instead fought very narrow turf, such as the successful auto bailout. \"It turns out that the auto bailout had greater legs than the Romney camp anticipated in places like Ohio,\" he says. As always, Ohio's election map was a complex puzzle for both sides. Obama was counting on his base of supporters in the same urban centers that buttressed his 2008 campaign in Ohio: Cleveland, Columbus, Cincinnati, Toledo, Dayton, Akron and Youngstown. Overwhelming support among blacks was key. In fact, Obama's support among whites in Ohio dropped enough from 2008 that Romney potentially could have taken the state had it not been for the higher African-American turnout. Virginia Here's another state where demographics played a key role, Edwards says. \"You've got more white-collar professionals in the urban areas, and they are more predisposed to support Obama,\" he says. \"That balances out the more conservative rural areas.\" Turley agrees. \"Virginia can no longer be counted as a red state,\" he says. \"Tim Kaine's victory [in the U.S. Senate race] underscores that.\" U.S. News breaks it down this way: \"[Obama] posted big margins in the more liberal counties of Northern Virginia, or NOVA. But to eke out his victory, he also made inroads in the crucial swing area of Prince William County, once considered the dividing line between NOVA and the more conservative ROVA, or 'Rest of Virginia.' And exit polls showed he performed better in the eastern half of the state than Democrat John Kerry in 2004.\"",

Pundits and prognosticators have long opined about President Obama's built-in advantages in Nevada, where he captured more than 55 percent of the vote in 2008. And with good reason. Democrats have a commanding voter registration lead, including among Latinos, and Obama's on-the-ground effort is fueled by the 55,000-member Culinary Union and Nevada Sen. Harry Reid's formidable state party organization. But despite those hurdles, and polls that continue to give Obama a small but persistent edge, Republican Mitt Romney's Nevada forces say they are convinced they can fight above their weight class, and that the Silver State \u2014 crucial to Romney's narrow path to the White House \u2014 is still in play. \"We've got a shot,\" Chris Carr, Romney's state manager, said recently at the campaign's bustling headquarters on the affluent far west side of Las Vegas. \"People are trying to write Gov. Romney's obituary in Nevada,\" Carr said, \"but there are legitimate pathways to victory for him here.\" Underestimate us at your peril, Romney's Nevada forces say, with a bravado that may belie their circumstances \u2014 but it's not as if either campaign has concluded that Nevada is a done deal. To underscore its continuing importance, Romney and his running mate, Wisconsin Rep. Paul Ryan, held a rally that attracted about 6,000 supporters in Las Vegas on Tuesday afternoon; Romney was scheduled to be back in the state on Wednesday, as was Obama. Opportunity, But Narrow It is true that the scrappy and engaging Carr, a Louisiana native who ran campaigns there before putting down political and personal roots in Las Vegas, has assembled a better GOP campaign effort than has been seen here in a good while. \"We've got a shot,\" says Romney Nevada state manager Chris Carr, shown here in Las Vegas.\n                \n                    \n                    Liz Halloran/NPR\n                    \n                \nhide caption \"We've got a shot,\" says Romney Nevada state manager Chris Carr, shown here in Las Vegas. And he's done it without a state Republican Party organization, which largely disintegrated after the Clark County GOP, which includes Las Vegas, was taken over by Ron Paul loyalists. Operating a campaign effort under the banner of \"Team Nevada,\" and with direct funding and staffing help from the Republican National Committee, the Romney organizers say their get-out-the-vote ground game \u2014 including a Latino outreach effort \u2014 is as big if not bigger than anything the party's ever had. The absence of a functioning state party organization has added to their challenge, they say, but in some ways, Team Nevada's independence has allowed a more nimble organization. In many respects, Nevada, and particularly the recession-humbled Las Vegas area, should provide fertile ground for Romney's message that the economy has continued to suffer under Obama. The state's unemployment rate remains the highest in the nation at 11.8 percent, down from a peak of 14 percent in October 2010; and its foreclosure rate, which was the worst in the nation for 62 consecutive months until March, now is fifth highest. Though the housing market is rebounding and unemployment is edging down, there are still an estimated 160,000-plus Nevadans looking for work, and many shuttered storefronts waiting for better times. Jillian Batchelor, a Las Vegas Realtor who voted for Obama in 2008, says she plans to mark her ballot for Romney this election, despite improvements she has seen in the real estate market, where prices are slowly improving and inventory is low, in part because of new rules that have slowed foreclosures. \"Jobs are still pretty hard to come by,\" she said. \"It just couldn't hurt to get someone new in there.\" But the anti-Romney headwinds remain fierce, his opportunity slender, and Democrats know it, carrying with them more than a bit of swagger while armed with data like this: Early in-person voting began Saturday, and as of Wednesday morning, 13 percent of Nevadans had already voted. Of those, 48 percent of the votes cast, or just over 60,000, were by registered Democrats; 35.3 percent, or just over 44,000, were by registered Republicans; and 16.4 percent, 20,500, were by those with no or \"other\" party affiliation. Democrats and Republicans had submitted almost exactly the same number of absentee and mail-in ballots statewide, according to data released late Tuesday by Nevada Secretary of State Ross Miller. In Clark County, where 851,803 of the state's 1.25 million voters reside, 10.5 percent of registered voters had cast ballots by Tuesday, including 46,416 Democrats, 28,321 Republicans, and 15,064 who weren't registered with either party. \"More people are going to vote early this cycle than in 2008,\" Obama national campaign manager Jim Messina said Tuesday during a conference call with reporters. \"Every single day now is Election Day.\" The Obama early voting game plan? It's all about getting out less reliable, or \"sporadic\" Obama voters before Election Day, Messina said, when they can count on party stalwarts to show up. The retort from Romney workers in Nevada? They don't have to work as hard to get their registered voters out, especially on Election Day. Democratic Machine: Reid Plus Unions At an Obama campaign Las Vegas field office recently, Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid told a group of Latino volunteers that he was feeling confident about the president's chances. Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid of Nevada takes questions from Latino volunteers at an Obama field office in Las Vegas.\n                \n                    \n                    Liz Halloran/NPR\n                    \n                \nhide caption Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid of Nevada takes questions from Latino volunteers at an Obama field office in Las Vegas. \"Obama's ahead by 6 in Nevada right now,\" Reid said, quoting Democratic pollster Mark Mellman. A day later, Mellman, who also serves as Reid's pollster, released a survey putting Obama's lead at 8 points. Nobody, Reid asserts, knows how to poll Nevada better than Mellman. (The RealClearPolitics Nevada poll average has Obama leading by 3.4 points.) And no organization knows how to mount a get-out-the-vote effort like the Culinary Workers Union, Local 226, in Las Vegas. \"We're not reinventing the wheel,\" says Yvanna Cancela, the local's political director and head of its 2012 GOTV operation. \"We're just very good at what we do.\" Since late summer, 72 union members have been on leave from their hotel and casino jobs, paid by the union to work in teams and make a personal contact with every union member in Clark County. Not just homes of the bartenders, housekeepers and food service workers in the Culinary Union, but also the electricians, truck drivers and trades people in other labor organizations. On a recent morning at union headquarters, in the shadow of the soaring Stratosphere Casino and Hotel, Cancela gave her usual morning pep talk, and volunteers gathered in teams at tables to map out their daily canvassing strategy. Dallany Santos, 33, who works at the D Hotel, and Emilia Cabrera, 59, for 14 years a housekeeper at the Excalibur hotel and casino, headed out together to the sun-blasted neighborhoods North Las Vegas. (Florida Sen. Marco Rubio, a GOP up-and-comer, grew up in this part of the city, and has been back to campaign for Romney.) After nearly two months of canvassing, their lists have shrunk to the truly difficult to contact, though the women say they keep coming back \u2014 three, sometimes four times to leave fliers and attempt a personal contact before crossing a name off their list. \"We're trying to be an example for people, for how you have to sacrifice to get what you what, what you need, and not just for yourself, but for others,\" said Santos, who like Cabrera is an immigrant. Later, they joke about casino magnate Sheldon Adelson, who is spending millions on Romney's effort. \"He gives millions in dollars,\" says Santos. \"We give millions in enthusiasm.\" Money Good, Organization Better, New Voters Best Both the Obama and Romney campaigns have focused on Latino voters in key swing states including Nevada, with advertisements in Spanish (including one in which Obama speaks in Spanish), and community meetings seeking to draw in the critical demographic. Romney's organization has four Hispanic outreach workers in Nevada, three in the Las Vegas area, one in the north state swing district of Washoe County that includes Reno. The effort is unprecedented for Nevada Republicans, says Romney state spokesman Mason Harrison. Adriana Ortiz, a Latino outreach volunteer for President Obama, in Las Vegas.\n                \n                    \n                    Liz Halloran/NPR\n                    \n                \nhide caption Adriana Ortiz, a Latino outreach volunteer for President Obama, in Las Vegas. At an Obama field office in heavily Hispanic East Las Vegas, supporter Adriana Ortiz, 37, said she became involved in the campaign because her younger sister is a \"Dreamer\" \u2014 an illegal immigrant brought to the U.S. by her parents as a child. \"I was a Dreamer, too, when I came to this country,\" says Ortiz, a married mother of two who operates a trucking company with her husband. A citizen now, she supports Obama, she says, because of \"what he's done for Dreamers.\" Obama supports DREAM Act legislation that would allow young people brought to the country illegally as children to remain in the U.S. with a path to citizenship if they meet certain criteria, including having a clean record, graduating from high school or serving in the military. In the absence of legislation, he issued a directive that would stop the deportation of young people who would qualify to remain in the country under the provisions outlined in the proposed DREAM Act. Voters like Ortiz are a key to the race in Nevada. A Latino Decisions poll from earlier this month showed Obama leading Romney 78 percent to 17 percent among Latino registered voters. Latinos make up about 27 percent of the state's population, according to U.S. Census estimates from 2011, up from 19.7 percent in 2000. The Romney campaign also is counting on big support from rural Nevada voters, and Mormons. But there aren't a whole lot of people in rural Nevada; and Romney's fellow Mormons make up about 7 percent of the state's population. But although outmanned (the Obama campaign has more than twice as many state offices) and outgunned on the ground, Romney's people have deployed their own canvassers, and continue to promise a close race despite the odds.",

For our series First and Main, Morning Edition is traveling to contested counties in swing states to find out what is shaping voters' decisions this election season. The latest trip took us to Larimer County, Colo. The presidential race has become much tighter in recent days, and in Colorado, a recent poll puts Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney in the lead. Buttons on display at the Larimer County GOP office.\n                \n                    \n                    Becky Lettenberger/NPR\n                    \n                \nhide caption Buttons on display at the Larimer County GOP office. Colorado is one of several swing states where campaign efforts will be concentrated in these past few weeks before the election. Of those efforts, actually getting people to the polls will be one of the most important. In Colorado, both the Romney and Obama campaigns have an eye on Latino voters in particular. The state has seen a tremendous amount of growth in the Latino population. According to census data, that particular demographic grew by 41 percent between 2000 and 2010. Latinos make up about 21 percent of Colorado's overall population. They're a smaller percentage of the population in Larimer County \u2014 only about 11 percent \u2014 but in a hotly contested swing county, it's a voting bloc that neither candidate can afford to ignore. On a rainy evening in downtown Fort Collins, we met with three Latino women \u2014 Betty Aragon, Guadalupe Salazar and Jan Barela-Smith \u2014 at their favorite Mexican restaurant. They'd been caught in a downpour on their way to meet us, and by the time we arrived, they were drying off and warming up with bowls of hot chili verde. All three women are Democrats, which puts them in sync with most Latino voters. Polls show Latinos support President Obama at a rate of more than 2 to 1. Aragon, a self-employed resident of Fort Collins, explains to us why she thinks that is: \"We're talking about the DREAM Act,\" she says. \"We're talking about the immigration issue. These are issues that really impact the Hispanic community.\" But Salazar and Barela-Smith \u2014 both of whom work in higher education \u2014 think that it's more than just traditional issues that keep Latinos in the Democratic camp. Salazar points out that the Romney campaign has raised the idea of cutting back on Pell Grants for higher education. That, she says, disproportionately affects Latinos \u2014 either preventing them from pursuing education or forcing them to take out more loans. Joseph Andujo says he believes Latinos and the Republican Party share the values of \"faith, family, freedom.\"\n                \n                    \n                    Becky Lettenberger/NPR\n                    \n                \nhide caption Joseph Andujo says he believes Latinos and the Republican Party share the values of \"faith, family, freedom.\" \"Since Obama has been in office, the Pell Grant went up from $4,300 to $5,550,\" she explains. \"That's a lot of money. That pays a full tuition, books and fees at Front Range [Community College] for a student to go. Without that money, they're not going to be able to go to college, and then they will take loans.\" While the Democrats are counting on Latino support, Republicans are trying to prove that their party is the natural home for Latino voters. One man who agrees with that is Joe Andujo, an information analyst for a health care group and a member of the Northern Colorado Hispanic Republicans. \"Faith, family, freedom\" \u2014 those are the values that he says he believes are held by both Latinos and by the Republican Party. \"None of us,\" he says, \"want handouts. We want a hand up. We want to be able to work hard and keep what we earned. And I think the Republican Party best demonstrates, or best helps us to achieve those goals of retaining what we have and living the American dream, which is why most immigrants come to this country to begin with.\" Andujo says he thinks the Republican Party could do much more to educate Latinos about who Republicans are and what the party stands for. That strategy could one day pay off for Republicans in attracting larger numbers of Latino voters. In the meantime, there's no guarantee that Latinos will turn out in great numbers. Both campaigns will be using these remaining few weeks to get out the vote.",

In Florida and other states, more Hispanics have already registered to vote this year than in 2008, and the presidential campaigns have spent $11 million on Spanish-language political ads \u2014 eight times the amount spent in the previous election. But that represents a small fraction of total campaign spending, and it's confined to just a handful of states, according to an analysis by the ad tracking firm Kantar Media CMAG. The report, prepared for NPR and PBS NewsHour, found that through September, the presidential campaigns had run Spanish-language ads in just seven media markets. Kantar's Ken Goldstein says that information provides a window into the thinking of the campaigns of President Obama and Republican nominee Mitt Romney. Delegates wave banners during Mitt Romney's acceptance speech at the Republican National Convention in August.\n                \n                    \n                    Mladen Antonov /AFP/Getty Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption Delegates wave banners during Mitt Romney's acceptance speech at the Republican National Convention in August. \"Advertising is reality ... [and] advertising is the ultimate tell,\" Goldstein says. \"Campaigns can say they're targeting a particular population, but it's really the case [that] if they're not doing it in paid advertising, they're not doing it.\" Targeted Communities Half of the spending targeted at Hispanics came in just three cities: Miami, Orlando and Tampa. Those, of course, are in Florida, the largest swing state, where nearly 1 out of every 6 voters is Hispanic. Most of the rest of the spending is focused on two other battleground states where Hispanics are key: Nevada and Colorado. Javier Palomarez of the U.S. Hispanic Chamber of Commerce thinks the campaigns are selling Latinos short. Even in Florida, Palomarez says Spanish-language ad spending is far less than what it should be. \"It's a prime target that the political campaigns simply have not figured out yet,\" Palomarez says. \"The audience for Spanish-language media is most certainly a voting audience, and it deserves the attention of our political candidates.\" If spending is the measure, the Obama campaign has worked harder to reach Hispanics in these key markets, spending double what the Romney campaign has allocated for Spanish-language ads. Matt Barreto is an associate professor of political science at the University of Washington who helps direct polling at Latino Decisions. The group's most recent tracking poll shows Romney capturing just over 23 percent of the Latino vote, although his numbers are slightly higher in battleground states. Barreto says that is less than the 31 percent of the Hispanic vote Republican John McCain received four years ago, and far below the goal of 38 percent the Romney campaign has set. The Romney campaign's largest ad buy targeting Hispanics is a Spanish-language version of an English-language ad. \"They need to really increase that outreach and make a connection,\" Barreto says. \"They need to make a sincere and solid connection with Latino voters, so they can get back up to 30, 35 [or] 40 percent of the Latino vote.\" Since the end of August, the Romney campaign has stepped up its spending on Spanish-language ads, but Barreto believes the Romney campaign is still learning how to best reach Hispanics in their native language. The campaign's largest ad buy features an English-speaking Romney with Spanish subtitles. That might be a good way to introduce the candidate, but it's just a start. Barreto says the campaign also has to speak to the issues Latinos care about in their own language. Barreto is most critical of the first Spanish-language ad put out by the campaign, called Day One, a direct Spanish translation of an English-language Romney ad. In it, Romney promises to repeal President Obama's health care overhaul. \"This [the health care law] is something very popular and very highly supported in the Latino community,\" Barreto says. \"That shows their inability to communicate and understand this electorate. So, they need to do their homework.\" Obama's Edge In reaching Hispanics, the Obama campaign has an advantage: The campaign already did it successfully in 2008, when more than two-thirds of Latinos voted for the president. And as they did four years ago, analysts say Obama's Spanish-language ads connect with Hispanics in style as well as substance. Cristina Saralegui, known as the \"Hispanic Oprah,\" is featured in several Obama ads. Another series profiles Obama campaign volunteers who talk about why they support the president. This Obama ad features campaign volunteers. One ad, filmed in the Tampa area, shows volunteer Elena Vidal McCullough meeting with a Latino couple to talk about the president's health care overhaul. Barreto believes that these kinds of ads \u2014 using real people \u2014 help build trust with Hispanic voters. \"There's lots of images of people within the Latino community there talking about ... [the] achievements Obama is trying to sell,\" he says. \"They come across as much more authentic.\" As the election approaches, the Romney campaign says it is planning a last-month ad blitz aimed at winning over Hispanics. In a new ad released Tuesday, it says Obama is saddling the next generation with a $16 trillion debt. The Romney campaign and the GOP are counting on concern about the economy to mobilize voters. But in the meantime, they're still figuring out how to speak to Latinos.",

It's easy to get upset during a political era in which the leaders of the two major parties seem incapable of putting aside their differences and working together to solve the nation's problems. But if there's plenty of blame to go around, some of it belongs to the voters themselves. They are the ones who have chosen the politicians. Quite often, they reward those who sit at either end of the ideological spectrum while punishing compromisers. In part, that's because voters are becoming more like rigid partisans \u2014 unwilling to see the other side as having any good ideas or political virtue. \"The folks who've worked across party lines are generally being replaced,\" says Joe Hackney, the Democratic leader in the North Carolina House. \"The public does ultimately hold the key to that.\" Living Separate Lives Recent polls underscore how much more polarized Americans have become.

Over the past 50 years, the percentage of people who said they'd be upset if their children married someone from the other party has jumped to 40 percent from 5 percent. We live in an era when the choice of chicken sandwiches can become a political marker. In one widely noted poll last week, even people's beer preferences were shown to be predictable based on their partisan inclinations. Increasingly, Americans are going so far as to change their opinions about key issues in order to better match their partisan group, says Bill Bishop, co-editor of The Daily Yonder, which follows rural issues. \"With issues as close to their heart as abortion and gay marriage, people are changing what they believe to stay with their [political] tribe,\" he says. Still Sorting Bishop commissioned a poll, which was released last week, that found people split along partisan lines when it came to their responses to immigration. Fair enough. But they split even more when informed that they were hearing the Republican or Democratic platform planks on the issue. In other words, just knowing the partisan label behind a position made people more likely to embrace or reject it. \"If you ask people how they feel about the deficit or the DREAM Act, you'll find people are hovering around the middle,\" says Shanto Iyengar, a political scientist at Stanford University. \"But over time, they have internalized the rhetoric they hear, that everyone on the other side is a total fill-in-the-blank.\" Iyengar co-authored a new study concluding that people's hostility to the \"other\" party has spiked in recent decades. There's an echo chamber effect to this. People are more likely to get their news from partisan news outlets and social media than they were a generation ago. And Americans are increasingly likely to live among people who share similar partisan leanings, says Bishop, who wrote a book called The Big Sort about this phenomenon. Back in 1976, only about one-fourth of Americans (26.8 percent) lived in landslide counties, which Bishop defines as giving the Democratic or Republican presidential candidates margins of 20 percentage points or higher. By 2008, nearly half of Americans lived in landslide counties (47.6 percent). Because Americans are able to shop around, in essence, for support for their own opinions through geography and media, they are now more polarized than Europeans \u2014 exactly the opposite of what was the case 30 years ago, says Torben L\u00fctjen, a political scientist at the University of Dusseldorf in Germany. L\u00fctjen is studying heavily Democratic Dane County and heavily Republican Waukesha County in Wisconsin, finding that people in these strongholds have completely separate and distinct worldviews and can't fathom their counterparts in the other place. \"We all love compromise,\" L\u00fctjen says. \"Then again, we only love compromise that serves our own interests.\" An Elite Phenomenon? There are political scientists who believe that it's still mainly the political \"elites\" \u2014 officeholders and interest groups \u2014 who are heavily polarized. Average voters, they maintain, are not so ideologically divided. \"The electorate has become more polarized, but not hugely so,\" says Jonathan Rauch, a guest scholar at the Brookings Institution. Voters are simply responding to the choices they're given by a political and primary system that is \"essentially rigged to favor extremists,\" he says. \"You cannot have moderate voters without moderate candidates.\" The number of voters who describe themselves as independent has been growing in recent years. Still, even they tend to hold strong partisan inclinations, says Elizabeth Theiss-Morse, a political scientist at the University of Nebraska. Many people, regardless of affiliation, subscribe to the mistaken belief that a big majority of Americans think the way they do, she says, and that it's only the intransigence of politicians that keeps them from doing the right thing. \"As with bad breath, ideology is always what the other person has,\" as the British cultural critic Terry Eagleton once put it. Not Going Away The world looks different to voters in, say, Iowa City than it does to those in more rural Marengo, Iowa \u2014 or those in liberal Rhode Island, versus more conservative Texas. Rather than simply being a partisan universe of its own, Congress thus mirrors differences that exist among voters in the country. And those differences aren't likely to fade anytime soon, says Alan Abramowitz, author of the recent book The Polarized Public. Voters are increasingly divided by race, along cultural lines, on ideological grounds and by geography, says Abramowitz, who teaches political science at Emory University. \"There's a very strong division among white voters that didn't used to exist or used to be very small, based on religious beliefs and practices,\" Abramowitz says. \"For the people who care about them, on those issues, it's very hard to compromise.\"",

            "article_content": "Republican presidential hopeful Mitt Romney promised to pursue a permanent fix for the country's \"broken\" immigration system during a Univision forum. Despite pointed questioning, Romney offered few details about how he would deal with millions of immigrants who are already in this country illegally.  STEVE INSKEEP, HOST: It's MORNING EDITION from NPR News. I'm Steve Inskeep. RENEE MONTAGNE, HOST: And I'm Renee Montagne. Mitt Romney and President Obama are making back-to-back appearances on Univision, the Spanish language TV network offering access to an increasingly important Latino audience. And last night, Romney promised to pursue a permanent fix for what he called the country's broken immigration system. Still, Romney offered few details about how he would deal with millions of immigrants who are already in this country illegally. Romney is trying to cut in to the big advantage that President Obama has with the fast-growing Latino population, as NPR's Scott Horsley reports. SCOTT HORSLEY, BYLINE: Having been criticized this week for his apparent willingness to write off nearly half the American public, Mitt Romney went out of his way during the Univision forum to say he wants to be president for the whole country. MITT ROMNEY: This is a campaign about the 100 percent. HORSLEY: Romney can ill afford to disregard the Latino vote, which has grown more than 25 percent just since 2008. Latinos are expected to cast more than one out of 12 votes nationwide. And here in Florida, the biggest of the November battlegrounds, it's more like one in five. (SOUNDBITE OF SONG) UNIDENTIFIED MAN: (Singing in Spanish) HORSLEY: At a campaign rally in Miami last night, Romney argued the Republican Party should be the natural home for Latino voters, because, he said, it's the party of hope and opportunity. ROMNEY: This is why Hispanic Americans are going to join this campaign. We're going to win because we're going to get the support of you and your friends. (SOUNDBITE OF CHEERING) HORSLEY: Romney notes that Latino unemployment has hovered above 10 percent for more than 50 months in a row. That dates back to the Bush administration. But Romney insists that President Obama's policies are largely to blame. ROMNEY: He's eloquent. He can describe his vision for the future. You heard his convention speech. He talked of all the things he wanted to do. But we have his record and his record speaks louder than his words will ever speak. (SOUNDBITE OF CHEERING) HORSLEY: Supporters, like insurance consultant Fernando Silva, waved signs that read: Juntos con Romney, or Together with Romney. FERNANDO SILVA: It seems that Governor Romney's policies would lead more to more economic freedom. I think that anybody who wants to see the country succeed is going to make the right choice and pick Governor Romney. HORSLEY: But Latinos who support Romney represent a minority within a minority. Polls suggest Romney is trailing Mr. Obama among Latinos by an even bigger margin than John McCain did four years ago. McCain, after all, had once bucked the Republican Party to pursue comprehensive immigration reform, while Romney has distinguished himself within the GOP for his hard line on illegal immigration. Pressed about that during last night's Univision forum, Romney agreed the U.S. immigration system is broken. ROMNEY: And it's been a political football for years and years, on the part of both Republicans and Democrats. It needs to be fixed. HORSLEY: But while he promised to work with both parties to resolve the issue, Romney offered few details of what a fix might look like. He criticized the president's decision to stop deporting illegal immigrants who came to this country as children as a mere stop-gap. But except for allowing those who serve in the military to obtain green cards, Romney refused to say how he would handle the so-called DREAM Act kids. (SOUNDBITE OF UNIVISION BROADCAST) UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN: Are you going to deport them or not? ROMNEY: Well, we're not... UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN: Yes or no. ROMNEY: We're not going to - we're not going to round up people around the country and deport them. That's not - I said during my primary campaign, time and again, we're not going to round up 12 million people, that includes the kids and the parents and have everyone deported. Our system isn't to deport people. We need to provide a long-term solution. HORSLEY: Romney also defended his support for Arizona's crackdown on illegal immigration, saying the state only acted because the federal government had failed to. The Obama campaign accused Romney of trying to gloss over his immigration record with an extreme makeover, but insisted it won't work. Mr. Obama will also be courting Latino voters with his own appearance on Univision later today. Scott Horsley, NPR News, Miami. Copyright \u00a9 2012 NPR.  All rights reserved.

Mitt Romney made yet another attempt Monday to narrow President Obama's substantial polling lead over him with Latino voters. The Republican presidential nominee spoke at the Los Angeles convention of the U.S. Hispanic Chamber of Commerce where he was respectfully received. His message? Obama's economic policies had failed the nation generally and Hispanics specifically. Also, there was plenty for Latino entrepreneurs to like in the low-tax, light-regulation policy prescriptions that Republicans offer. Romney's message was similar to the one he has delivered before to Latino audiences: that he would comprehensively reform the nation's broken immigration system, another area where Obama failed. He said: ROMNEY: \"Candidate Obama said that one of his highest priorities would be to fix immigration in his first year in office. Despite his party having majorities in both houses of Congress, the President never even offered up a bill. Like so many issues confronting our nation, when it comes to immigration, politics has been put ahead of people for too long. \"I will work with Republicans and Democrats to permanently fix our immigration system.\" But the daunting size of the challenge before Romney was not so much measured by the polite if tepid applause such lines received as much as it was by repeated polling that shows him lagging badly with Hispanic voters. The latest, released Monday by Latino Decisions, showed Obama leading Romney by 53 points among Hispanic women and 29 points among Hispanic men. And a surprising twist that threatened to overshadow Romney's outreach this week to Latinos was the emergence of a video Mother Jones brought to widespread attention. The video was apparently recorded secretly at a private event and purportedly shows Romney joking that if his father were Mexican instead of just born in Mexico, \"I'd have a better shot at winning this.\" Meanwhile, Obama's campaign was working hard to undercut Romney by reminding Latino voters of the steps the president has taken to stop deportation proceedings against young illegal immigrants who meet certain conditions. In a prerecorded message to the Hispanic convention, Obama mentioned his unilateral action to put certain parts of the DREAM Act into place and called for Congress to pass the associated legislation. This drew enthusiastic applause from the audience. In addition, the president's campaign sought to remind Latinos of the tougher positions Romney articulated on illegal immigration during the Republican primaries. In a GOP debate during the primaries, Romney called for illegal immigrants to self-deport. A video the Obama campaign released before Romney's speech began: \"This week on Mitt Romney: Extreme Makeover Campaign Edition, Mitt Romney is faced with one of his most implausible makeovers yet: making his extreme policies seem appealing to Latino voters.\"",

Spanish-language network Univision announced Wednesday that, along with Facebook, it will host discussions with the presidential candidates next week, calling them \"the first-ever events of their kind targeting Hispanic Americans.\" The \"Meet the Candidate\" events \u2014 featuring Republican nominee Mitt Romney on Sept. 19 and President Obama on Sept. 20 \u2014 will be held at the University of Miami and will be broadcast on Univision and streamed online in English. Jorge Ramos, a Univision host who will be moderating the discussions, tells NPR's Michel Martin that the decision to schedule the candidate forums came after the Commission on Presidential Debates announced the moderators for its four events. \"What happened is the commission is stuck in the 1950s. And that has to change,\" Ramos says. \"The commission decided that two men and two women were going to be the moderators for the debates, and I really thought it was incredible, truly incredible, that they didn't choose a Hispanic journalist to be part of the debates.\" The commission has announced that the moderators for the presidential debates will be PBS's Jim Lehrer on Oct. 3; CNN's Candy Crowley on Oct. 16; and CBS's Bob Schieffer on Oct. 22. The vice presidential debate on Oct. 11 will be moderated by Martha Raddatz of ABC. Univision asked the commission to reconsider, Ramos says, but \"the commission rejected our proposal to either include a Hispanic journalist or to have another debate about Hispanic issues. \"And at the end, what we had to do was the following: If they didn't want to invite us to their party, we created our own party,\" he says. Ramos says while the commission \"didn't get it,\" Romney and Obama both did. \"They do get the fact that either they appeal to Latinos or they'll lose the election,\" he says. \"The Hispanic community right now, we're about 50 million. In 40 years, it's going to be 125 million. And we're changing everything. It's truly a demographic revolution.\" Ramos says the forums will likely center on issues like unemployment, poverty, education and relations with Latin America, as well as immigration. \"We have to ask Gov. Romney about his 'self-deportation' idea; we have to ask him why he is against immigration reform; why he opposes the DREAM Act; why in the platform, [Republicans] are for building a new fence between Mexico and the United States,\" Ramos says. \"And for President Barack Obama, we have to remember that he broke a major electoral promise when he said in 2008 that he was going to present an immigration proposal during his first year in office and he didn't keep his word. So we have to ask him about that. We have to ask him about [why] President Barack Obama has deported more immigrants than any other president in the history of the United States \u2014 more than 1.2 million immigrants.\" As for what language the forums will be in, Ramos says, \"I guess they could be called Spanglish. But it's a pretty easy format for us. We would be asking the questions in Spanish; they would be answering the questions in English. We will have a translator for each one of them, and they would translate from English to Spanish for our audience.\" You can hear much more from Michel's conversation with Ramos by clicking on the audio link above.",

Patricia Haynes Smith of Baton Rouge. \"I'm 66 years old,\" said Smith, at an event Tuesday in Charlotte, N.C., for black state legislators here for the Democratic National Convention. \"And before 2008, I didn't think I'd live to see a dream come true.\" Barack Obama's election as president four years ago was an enormous milestone in the nation's often halting march toward equality, and a realized American dream for many African-Americans. This time, it feels different, said Smith and others we interviewed at the legislators' wine and hors d'oeuvres gathering in the city's Harvey B. Gantt Center, named for the man who became the city's first African-American mayor in 1983. In 2008, Obama felt like theirs, said Smith, a convention delegate, who was sporting an \"Obama Y'all\" button. \"Now, he's not there just for people who look like me \u2014 he's for all Americans, from all walks of life, all shapes, colors and sizes,\" she said. In two days, Obama will again accept his party's nomination. \"It does feel different for me,\" said Smith. \"This time my biggest concern is making sure we get voters out.\" Her comments echoed an overarching theme we heard from others at the event: Obama is also president for Americans they felt were not reflected at last week's largely white Republican National Convention, including advocates for women's reproductive rights, Latinos fighting for immigration reform and the DREAM Act, and gay rights activists. \"We've lived the dream, now we have to do the work,\" said Marcus Wheeler, 36, a NASA engineer and Florida convention delegate. \"I would have the same expectation for any president that I have for him.\" \"People of any color want to go to work, want good jobs,\" he said. \"We need to keep the ball rolling.\" This how Oregon state Rep. Lew Frederick, 60, of Portland, characterized conversations among African-Americans at this convention: \"Race, culture, economic status and gender are issues now fueling a lot of the discussion here.\" That doesn't mean that Obama's race isn't still in play in this campaign, and some expressed frustration at what they see as GOP efforts to portray the president as somehow not American. \"What's the slogan they're using \u2014 'Take Our Country Back'?\" said Dianne Hart, 57, of Tampa, Fla. \"From what?

Darryl Owens, 74, of Louisville, Ky., says has driven race relations backward since Obama's election. \"Many people thought the country was changing, and changing too fast,\" he said of Obama's election four years ago. \"We're seeing a lot of white middle-class people voting against their own self-interest because they feel the nation has changed too much \u2014 an African-American in the White House, gay marriage.\" But for Greenville, S.C., County Councilwoman Xanthene Norris, 83, this year is still filled with hope. \"We have struggled through the years,\" said Norris. \"We are supporting President Obama not because he's a black president, but because he's a great president.\"",

Jeb Bush speaks Thursday at the Republican National Convention. Jeb Bush acknowledged that he had something he wanted to get off his chest, and he did. Appearing Thursday at a Republican convention that has barely mentioned his brother \u2014 two-term President George W. Bush \u2014 Jeb Bush took a point of personal prerogative (he is, after all, also the son of a former president), to honor his brother and scold the man who followed him into the Oval Office. \"Mr. President,\" said the former two-term Florida governor. \"It's time to stop blaming your predecessor for your failed economic policies. A real leader would have accepted responsibility for your actions, and you haven't done it.\" Bush's tribute to his brother was short, and delivered with an affectionate smile. \"My brother,\" he said, \"Well, I love my brother. He is a man of integrity, courage and honor. And during incredibly challenging times, he kept us safe.\" What followed was the kind of speech Jeb Bush, 59, has been giving a lot of lately, one promoting reform and school choice, dinging teachers unions and speaking of education as the ultimate key to equality. Like some of the other speakers at the convention, though, his time on the podium seemed as much about his own passions as it did the point of the evening. Mitt Romney was mentioned by name only three times, with the first coming more than five minutes into his 15 minutes onstage. It was a popular speech with the delegates, more popular than many of Jeb Bush's recent observations about his own party. He's become a bit of an agent provocateur, needling Republicans, including this year's field of presidential hopefuls, for what he has characterized as their refusal to seek common ground and for the harsh tone they have taken on immigration. He roiled many Republicans when he suggested in a June interview with Bloomberg that both his father, George H.W. Bush, and Ronald Reagan would have had a tough time capturing the GOP presidential nomination in today's hyperpartisan environment. Here's what he said in that June interview: \"Ronald Reagan would have had, based on his record of finding accommodation, finding some degree of common ground, as would my dad \u2014 they would have a hard time if you define the Republican Party \u2014 and I don't \u2014 as having an orthodoxy that doesn't allow for disagreement, doesn't allow for finding some common ground.\" He knocked the GOP primary field, too, and its hard-line immigration positions, with this comment in February after a speech in Dallas: \"I used to be a conservative, and I watch these debates and I'm wondering, I don't think I've changed, but it's a little troubling sometimes when people are appealing to people's fears and emotion rather than trying to get them to look over the horizon for a broader perspective and that's kind of where we are.\" More recently, Bush has become a vocal contrarian within his party on immigration. Bush's wife, Columba, is a Mexican native whom Jeb met on a high school program. He is fluent in Spanish and often gave parts of speeches bilingually as governor. Recent polling is showing Obama leading Romney by some 40 percentage points among Latino voters. That's even more lopsided than the 2008 election results, when Obama defeated Republican Sen. John McCain, 67-31 percent, among Hispanic voters. This week in Tampa, Jeb Bush told Wolf Blitzer of CNN that Republicans need to rethink their approach to immigration, the tone they take while doing so, and to find a solution to the DREAM Act, which allows young people brought to the country illegally as minors a path to citizenship under certain circumstances: \"Immigration is a gateway, basically. It's a checkoff point for Latino voters. They want to hear about these bigger, broader issues. Finding a permanent solution to the DREAM Act, qualified people is definitely the responsibility of the next president. ... I think from a political point of view, across the county, across the long haul, Republicans need to be more respectful of voters they are trying to attract.\" His comments were echoed Thursday by former Florida Sen. Mel Martinez, who, in an interview with the Los Angeles Times, warned Republicans that they risk being relegated to minority-party status if they don't adopt a more open attitude toward the fastest-growing ethnic minority.

President Obama managed to combine the two topics in Colorado Thursday. While on a campaign stop, he visited the Olympic Training Center in Colorado Springs.  STEVE INSKEEP, HOST: It's MORNING EDITION, from NPR News. I'm Steve Inskeep. RENEE MONTAGNE, HOST: And I'm Renee Montagne. Good morning. We're going to start this morning by visiting two swing states seen as crucial to each presidential candidate: one is Florida, the other Colorado, where President Obama this week sampled Mexican food in Pueblo, courted women voters in Denver, and dropped by the Olympic Training Center in Colorado Springs. Our coverage starts with NPR's Scott Horsley. SCOTT HORSLEY, BYLINE: Presidential politics is having to compete for air time this summer with the Olympics. And sometimes, it seems like even the candidates would rather be watching the games. (SOUNDBITE OF SPEECH) PRESIDENT BARACK OBAMA: For those of you who are curious, the women are doing pretty good right now in soccer... HORSLEY: President Obama's campaign rally yesterday coincided with the gold medal women's soccer match between the U.S. and Japan. Mr. Obama tried to provide an update for the sports-hungry political junkies who gathered in the outdoor park. (SOUNDBITE OF SPEECH) OBAMA: The game's not over, and some of you may have DVR'd it, so I'm not going to say any more. But we're making progress. HORSLEY: Republican Mitt Romney, of course, has his own ties to the games. His leadership of the Salt Lake City Olympics was the launch pad for his political career. And this summer, his wife's horse competed in the dressage event. Beyond their common Olympic enthusiasm, though, the two men have plenty of differences. Romney's taken a tough stance against illegal immigration, while Mr. Obama decided to stop deporting the so-called DREAM Act kids, who were brought to the U.S. as children. The president ordered free insurance coverage for birth control, while Romney wants to eliminate the government's family planning efforts. And while Romney would allow a tax credit for wind energy producers to expire, Mr. Obama wants to extend it, saying that credit helps to support some 5,000 Colorado jobs. (SOUNDBITE OF SPEECH) OBAMA: Government can't solve all your problems. Government can't help folks who won't help themselves, but there are things we can do to make sure that everybody's got a chance, everybody's got opportunity. HORSLEY: Later, during a visit to Colorado's Olympic Training Center, Mr. Obama saluted the women's soccer team for winning their match against Japan and the gold medal. This year, Colorado voters will help to decide which candidate wins political gold. Scott Horsley, NPR News, Colorado Springs. Copyright \u00a9 2012 NPR.  All rights reserved.

Several times in the next few months, we'll travel to a battleground state, then to a vital county in each state. In that county, we find a starting point for our visit: First and Main streets, the intersection of politics and real life. Sofia Martinez was a kid when she began what you could call her life on the road. \"I can remember when my dad used to work in a factory in Toledo, Ohio, lost his job, and then that's when we started becoming migrant families \u2014 I was around 9 years old,\" she says. \"It was in the third grade.\" She still remembers the crops. She still remembers the seasons of a life lived North and South. She'd begin the school year in Ohio. \"Right around October-November, we would get pulled out of school, come down here to Florida and start with orange groves, grapefruit, and then strawberry and then tomatoes. \"And then right around April or May, head back up to Ohio to do the whole thing all over again.\" These days, Martinez has settled down. She got an education and has a job in Plant City, Fla. That town is part of Hillsborough County, a swing county in the political battleground of Florida. Beginning at the intersection of First and Main in suburban Tampa, we've traveled across the county, meeting voters where they live, listening to them think, and letting them open a door into their lives. 'Core Values' Martinez is a nurse practitioner in a pediatrics clinic, part of a community health chain called Suncoast. Many patients come from migrant families. Martinez is Mexican-American. She was born in the United States, but many of her patients were not. On the morning we visited, one of her patients was a 3-day-old baby whose father had just been deported. \"Sad,\" she says. But \"common, very common.\" Her experience leads her to support the DREAM Act \u2014 a proposal that would make it easier for children brought to the U.S. illegally to become citizens. \"Those students grow up here \u2014 maybe [are] here all their life. [They] never even know or heard or remember Mexico or wherever they're from,\" she says. \"They can't go to college; they can't get a driver's license. ... And that's a DREAM Act I hope one day won't be a dream, and a lot of these kids can do what I did, and make something of themselves.\" President Obama's administration has said it will stop deporting many young people, whether the DREAM Act is passed or not. His Republican rival, Mitt Romney, has spoken of vetoing the measure and of pushing illegal immigrants to \"self-deport.\" Martinez says she believes the country would do better if it returned to \"some basic core values.\"\n                \n                    \n                    Becky Lettenberger/NPR\n                    \n                \nhide caption Martinez says she believes the country would do better if it returned to \"some basic core values.\" But that issue will not determine how Martinez votes. \"From my core values, what my core values are, I will be voting Republican,\" she says. 'Sign The DREAM Act' Martinez was raised Catholic, is now Baptist, and is the mother of two daughters. \"Sometimes the stories that come back from school \u2014 even the teacher isn't giving my child a good moral compass or example,\" she says. \"The desensitization of our children to violence and sex, it's hard. \"And hopefully public school won't get any worse than it already is.\" One of Martinez's co-workers joined our conversation. She said Romney is closer to what she calls \"God's values,\" and mentioned Obama's support for gay marriage. To which Martinez adds: \"I don't hate Obama by any means. You know, he has done an OK job. I don't think he has done a terrible job. I don't think he's, you know, put our country in the sewer by any means. \"But for me, I mean, I would think that if the country got back to some basic core values, maybe we'd all do a lot better.\" To those who would argue that the Democrats are the ones who speak up for immigrants and advocate for the DREAM Act, Martinez says: \"Unfortunately, I don't think either party makes the best advocacy for migrants or farm workers. \"The Democrats have touted a lot about their DREAM Act and maybe, you know, doing a lot of promises. But still the DREAM Act has been going on for how long and still hasn't been in effect.\" Martinez serves as a reminder about the huge, and growing, Hispanic vote. While the group leans Democratic, it's not monolithic. And while analysts expect Obama to win Hispanics, the question is by how much. The margin matters in a closely divided state like Florida. When it comes time to count the votes in Hillsborough County, Romney can count on Martinez. But if he should campaign here, he should not count on her to stay quiet about that issue that touches her life. If either candidate walked through the door, Martinez knows what she'd tell him: \"Sign the DREAM Act, that's what I would say. Sign the DREAM Act.\" If her view seems contradictory, that's common among voters, as they consider many issues in Hillsborough County. Maybe it's understandable. Florida voters, like voters everywhere, are responding to life in a complicated nation. It was the American poet Walt Whitman who wrote: \"Very well then, I contradict myself. I am large, I contain multitudes.\" It's only at election time that multitudes are asked to choose between parties that enforce their rigid visions of a small and divided world.",

Hong/AP\n                    \n                \nhide caption Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., listens at left as Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney speaks in Aston, Pa., in April. Republican leaders from Jeb Bush to John McCain have touted Rubio for vice president. Among the Tea Party successes in the 2010 congressional elections was U.S. Sen. Marco Rubio of Florida. He is now one of those on Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney's short list of possible running mates. For any political party, Rubio would be worthy of consideration for vice president or a higher office. He's smart, good-looking and charismatic. The Cuban-American is a plus for Republicans, a party that polls show has been losing ground with Hispanics. Rubio has been in the Senate less than two years, but while others across the country are still getting to know him, he has long been a familiar face to Floridians. Rubio served a decade in Florida's Legislature where he was House speaker \u2014 the first Cuban-American and youngest person ever to hold that office. Like Barack Obama, another young, charismatic politician, Rubio is a quick study. One reason why respected Republican leaders from Jeb Bush to John McCain have touted him for vice president. Despite that, the Romney campaign had to tamp down early reports that Rubio wasn't being vetted as a possible running mate. In an unusual announcement, Romney told reporters Rubio was under serious consideration. Al Cardenas, former chairman of Florida's Republican Party, and now head of the American Conservative Union, recommended Rubio to the Romney campaign based on what he's seen at the group's CPAC gatherings, where the Florida senator has been a star. \"Most of the time, elections are decided by turnout, more so than by polling numbers,\" Cardenas says. \"I believe that Marco's greatest gift to a Romney candidacy will be the passion amongst activists and the impact he'll have on the turnout.\" In the Senate, Rubio has made some tough choices. As the body's only Hispanic Republican, he's stood with his party's leadership opposing a measure popular with Latinos: the DREAM Act. It's a bill that would create a path toward permanent residency for young illegal immigrants brought to the U.S. as children. Rubio says the measure would encourage illegal immigration. In June, President Obama took administrative actions that essentially put in place much of the DREAM Act. Rubio accused him of playing politics with the issue. As a Hispanic leader, Rubio has worked to carve out his own position on immigration. In his speech to the Hispanic Leadership Network, he said he believed there is bipartisan support for fixing what he calls a \"broken legal immigration system.\" \"And that's why I challenge the Republican nominees and all Republicans to not just be the anti-illegal immigration party. That's not who we are. That's not who we should be. We should be the pro-legal immigration party,\" he said. But so far, Rubio's attempts to find middle ground on immigration \u2014 one that wins approval from Hispanics but doesn't alienate his Republican base \u2014 have gained little traction. And after nearly two years as a senator and national political figure, it's not clear how much Rubio could do to help Mitt Romney win support among Hispanics. A survey conducted recently by Latino Decisions, an independent polling group, found that except in Florida, putting Rubio on the presidential ticket would do little to build Hispanic support. As a politician still new to the national stage, Rubio carries baggage from his days in the Florida Legislature. He's had to address issues including his use of a party credit card for personal expenses. Rubio says he sometimes used the party credit card by mistake for personal items, but never billed the GOP. Casey Klofstad, an associate professor of political science at the University of Miami, says that could make him an awkward running mate for Romney. \"There have already been accusations of the governor [Romney] in terms of his dealings with Bain Capital, in terms of offshore accounts. Well, we've already got somebody who has money issues, if you want to call it that,\" says Klofstad. \"Do we want to add a vice president who may have those as well?\" Among political analysts, the conventional wisdom suggests Romney is likely to go with a safe choice \u2014 a running mate who's tested and unlikely to bring any surprises. But Rubio remains an intriguing possibility because of what he represents for the Republican Party. At just 41 years old, Rubio has plenty of time yet to help shape the party's direction. And in the here and now, some polls show putting Rubio on the ticket could add a couple of points to Romney's support in Florida \u2014 enough possibly to win the state in a close election.",

Get used to hearing the name Julian Castro. You're likely to be coming across it a lot in coming days and perhaps beyond. President Obama chose Castro, the 37-year-old mayor of San Antonio, to be the keynote speaker at the Democratic National Convention in Charlotte, N.C., in September. That makes Castro the first Hispanic American (he's Mexican-American specifically) to be given the high-profile role at a Democratic convention. (President Ronald Reagan chose then-U.S. Treasurer Katherine Davalos Ortega to keynote the 1984 Republican convention in Dallas.) The spot of keynote speaker at Democratic conventions typically goes to rising stars in the party, with an emphasis during the last few conventions on youth. Indeed, it was his star turn as keynoter at the 2004 Democratic National Convention that helped make Obama a political superstar. Castro certainly fits the bill of rising star. And he's certainly ambitious, as apparent in interviews with NPR's Neal Conan on Talk of the Nation and WGBH's One on One with Maria Hinojosa. A graduate of Stanford University and Harvard Law School (like his twin brother, Joaquin, a Texas state representative), Castro became the youngest mayor of a top 50 U.S. city in 2009. That, among other achievements, long ago put Castro on the radar of some of the keenest political observers as a local politician with national potential. A 2010 New York Times magazine profile of Castro quotes Mark McKinnon, once an adviser to President George W. Bush and Sen. John McCain: \" 'Julian Castro has a very good chance of becoming the first Hispanic president of the United States.' he says flatly.\" Judging by the Times profile there's probably much to support McKinnon's statement. It appears he has as much of a chance to be the first Hispanic president as anyone. Like Obama, Castro was raised by an idealistic single mother concerned with social justice. In Castro's case, his mother was a leading activist with La Raza Unida, a 1970s political movement aimed at increasing Chicano political power in the Southwest. One of the most fascinating tidbits from the profile was that Castro didn't learn to speak Spanish at home and in the neighborhood, like many other Latino politicians, who use their fluency in the language to connect with Spanish speakers. An excerpt: \"A Mexican-American with statewide political aspirations needs to be able to do more than pronounce his name correctly. Early in his administration, Castro assigned his chief of staff, Robbie Greenblum \u2014 a Jewish lawyer from the border town of Laredo whose own Spanish is impeccable \u2014 to discreetly find him a tutor. Rosie Castro's son is now being taught Spanish by a woman named Marta Bronstein. Greenblum met her in shul.\" Only in America. The choice of Castro can be viewed as Obama's way of showing Latino voters that he values them and underscores how important their votes are to him. The president enjoys a huge advantage over Mitt Romney in terms of Latino support, as indicated by polling. But the question has been how much of that support will translate into people actually going to the polls on Election Day. Democrats have worried that because it's unlikely they'll match the excitement of 2008, some of that much-needed Latino support may just stay home come Nov. 6. Such concerns mean Obama needs to find ways to excite his political base, particularly Hispanics whose support could mean the difference between victory and defeat in battleground states like Florida, Nevada and Colorado. The president's recent move to use executive action to put into effect some of the goals of the stalled DREAM Act legislation, including stopping deportations of certain young illegal immigrants while allowing them to work legally or attend school in the U.S., could translate into more Hispanic votes for the president. The selection of an attractive, brainy politician like Castro for the keynote speech could also help the president generate more excitement among Latino voters.",

For those that come here illegally, the idea of giving them in-state tuition credits or other special benefits I find to be contrary to the idea of a nation of law.\" LeMars, Iowa, Dec. 31, 2011 Illegal immigrants living in the U.S.: Obama: Has ordered a stop to the deportations of younger illegal immigrants who came to U.S. as children and have no criminal history; administration presided over record 396,906 deportations in 2011. \"This is not amnesty; this is not immunity. This is not a path to citizenship. It's not a permanent fix. This is a temporary stopgap measure that lets us focus our resources wisely while giving a degree of relief and hope to talented, driven, patriotic young people.\" Rose Garden remarks on suspension of deportations of young people, June 15, 2012 Romney: Has advocated \"self-deportation\" and sanctions for employers who hire illegal workers. Romney has declined to say whether he would reverse Obama's policy on younger immigrants if elected president, and referred to the president's plan as a politically motivated, \"stopgap measure.\" \"The answer is self-deportation, which is people decide they can do better by going home because they can't find work here because they don't have legal documentation to allow them to work here. We're not going to round people up.\" GOP primary debate, Tampa, Fla., Jan. 23, 2012 Arizona immigration enforcement law: Obama: Opposed; said law, key parts of which the Supreme Court has struck down, undermines notion of fairness. \"What this decision makes unmistakably clear is that Congress must act on comprehensive immigration reform. A patchwork of state laws is not a solution to our broken immigration system; it's part of the problem.\" Response to high court ruling, June 25, 2012 Romney: Endorsed parts of law as \"model\" during February primary debate, defends state-based immigration action as a right. \"I believe that each state has the duty \u2014 and the right \u2014 to secure our borders and preserve the rule of law, particularly when the federal government has failed to meet its responsibilities.\" Response to high court ruling, June 25, 2012 Comprehensive immigration overhaul: Obama: Supported failed 2007 legislation that would have created path to citizenship for illegal immigrants; criticized by Hispanic community for not pursuing reform when he had Democratic majorities in Congress. \"My Cabinet has been working very hard on trying to get it done, but ultimately, I think somebody said the other day, I am president, I am not king. I can't do these things just by myself. We have a system of government that requires the Congress to work with the executive branch to make it happen.\" Univision Radio interview with Eddie \"Piolin\" Sotelo, Oct. 25, 2010 Romney: Had supported 2007 immigration reform act that created path to citizenship for illegal immigrants; since denounced it as \"amnesty plan.\" \"Amnesty is a magnet. ... Programs that have said that if people who come here illegally are going to get to stay illegally for the rest of their life, that's going to only encourage more people to come here illegally.\" CNN GOP primary debate, Nov. 22, 2011 Border fence: Obama: Supported 2006 congressional measure to build a fence on U.S. border with Mexico; declared, to much GOP criticism in May 2011, that the fence is \"basically complete.\" \"We have gone above and beyond what was requested by the very Republicans who said they supported border reform as long as we got serious about enforcement. ... They'll want a higher fence. Maybe they'll need a moat. Maybe they want alligators in the moat. They'll never be satisfied. And I understand that. That's politics.\" El Paso, Texas, May 10, 2011 Romney: Supports; also wants more guards to secure it. \"We've got to have a fence, or the technologically approved system to make sure we know who's coming into the country, No. 1. No. 2, we ought to have enough agents to secure that fence and to make sure that people coming over are caught.\" Reagan Library GOP primary debate, Sept. 7, 2011 English as the official language: Obama: Opposes; voted no as senator in 2007 on amendment to immigration overhaul bill that would have made English the national language. \"Now, I agree that immigrants should learn English. I agree with that. But understand this. Instead of worrying about whether immigrants can learn English \u2014 they'll learn English \u2014 you need to make sure your child can speak Spanish. You should be thinking about, how can your child become bilingual?\" Powder Springs, Ga., July 8, 2008 Romney: Supports; also supports English immersion over bilingual education. \"I believe English should be the official language of the United States. I also believe that in our schools, we should teach kids in English. ...

Coming a week after President Obama announced that he would defer deportation proceedings for many young illegal immigrants, it was safe to predict that he'd get an appreciative response from an audience of Latino leaders. They didn't disappoint. It started with a woman in the audience at the National Association of Latino Elected and Appointed Officials shouting, \"We love you,\" shortly after Obama took the stage, and never diverged much from that. The president received repeated applause, especially when he discussed his recent actions to put into place elements of the DREAM Act. Long stalled in Congress, the act would allow many young people brought into the U.S. illegally by their parents to obtain permits that would let them legally work or attend college. Clearly sensing he was among mostly political friends, Obama used the opportunity to take on his Republican challenger, Mitt Romney, who spoke at the conference the day before. Without mentioning Romney by name in any of his several references, Obama said: \"Your speaker from yesterday has a different view. In his speech he said that when he makes a promise to you he'll keep it. Well, he has promised to veto the DREAM Act. And we should take him at his word.\" The president paused to let the audience's applause and cheers die down, as well as for dramatic effect, then added: \"I'm just saying.\" More cheers and applause. Then Obama said: \"I believe that would be a tragic mistake. You do too.\" Because the economy and jobs are the main issues for voters across the demographic spectrum, Obama touted tax cuts he signed to help small businesses and initiatives to make higher education available to more people through expanded Pell grants and aid to community colleges. The president defended his signature health care law, whose fate could be determined by a Supreme Court decision next week, as \"the right thing to do.\" The Romney campaign tried to use the president's appearance to exploit the difference between the hope Obama engendered in his 2008 supporters and the disappointment many feel now. Amanda Henneberg, a Romney campaign spokeswoman, said in a written statement: \"In 2008, candidate Obama promised NALEO he would create new jobs and end the housing crisis. Four years later, President Obama is back asking for more time. No election-year speech can cover up the president's job-killing policies that have led to 11 percent Hispanic unemployment and millions of Hispanics living in poverty. On Day One, Mitt Romney will take our country in a new direction and get our economy back on the right track.\" It was immigration, an issue on which Romney got a tepid response at the same conference the day before, that Obama got the most enthusiastic feedback. The president used the issue to underscore one of his favorite 2012 campaign themes: The solutions to the problems now facing the nation are well known. What's lacking, he argues, is the will of Republicans to reach any deals because of the pressure from their party's right wing. Obama referred back to the bipartisanship that existed during the failed attempt by his White House predecessor to get immigration reform legislation enacted in 2006. \"Just six years ago, an unlikely trio \u2014 John McCain, Ted Kennedy, President Bush \u2014 came together to champion comprehensive immigration reform. I, along with a lot of other Democrats, were proud to join 23 Senate Republicans in voting for it. \"Today, those same Republicans have been driven away from the table by a small faction of their own party. It's created the same kind of stalemate on immigration reform that we're seeing on a whole range of other economic issues. And it's given rise to a patchwork of state laws that cause more problems than they solve and are often doing more harm than good. \"This makes no sense. It's not good for America. And as long as I'm president of the United States, I will not give up the fight to change it. In the face of a Congress that refuses to do anything on immigration, I've said that I'll take action wherever I can. So my administration has been doing what we can for more than three years now ... \"... We should have passed the DREAM Act a long time ago. It was written by members of both parties. When it came up for a vote a year and a half ago, Republicans in Congress blocked it. The bill hadn't changed. The need hadn't changed. The only thing that had changed was politics.\" Obama continued his feisty declaration by saying that he couldn't agree more with his congressional critics that Congress should ultimately take steps to reform the nation's immigration laws. \"For those who say we should do this in a bipartisan fashion \u2014 absolutely. My door has been open for 3 1/2 years. They know where to find me.\" If Obama seemed confident, he had every right to be, according to polls that show the president enjoying a large lead over Romney among Latinos. A poll released Friday by Latino Decisions and America's Voice showed Obama with large leads over the all-but-official Republican presidential nominee in several battleground states. And the energy for Obama among Latino voters only seemed to be increasing, according to pollsters.",

Come out against the president's stance, popular with many Latino voters but not exclusively so, and Republicans run the risk of further alienating many of those voters. But come out in support of the president's act, and many conservatives in the Republican base could get angry. Also, GOP lawmakers aren't exactly all on the same page on the issue. And it appears, as we posted about earlier, that a majority of voters support Obama's position. So it makes political sense that if there were ever a time for one party leader to allow another party leader to go out first, this is one of those times. On Capitol Hill Tuesday, Sen. Mitch McConnell, a Kentucky Republican and the Senate minority leader, told reporters he would let the all-but-official Republican presidential nominee first announce a position on Obama's decision before offering his own position publicly. The Washington Post reported that McConnell told reporters: \" 'I think we're going to wait and see what Gov. Romney has to say, and we're going to be discussing his views on this,' McConnell told reporters at the Capitol Tuesday. 'I think many of us may have similar views. Others may not.' \"McConnell said he was deferring to Romney because the former Massachusetts governor is 'the leader of our party from now until November \u2014 and, we hope, beyond.' \" During the weekend, Romney said he disagreed with Obama's decision. But he didn't spell out what he would do if he wins the White House, as in whether he would repeal the action or not. Romney may give a more definitive answer when he appears Thursday in Florida at a meeting of the National Association of Latino Elected and Appointed Officials. Meanwhile, Sen. Harry Reid of Nevada, the Democrat who serves as Senate majority leader, had fun at McConnell's and Romney's expense. The Hill newspaper reported Reid telling reporters: \" 'I can't imagine that he's going to get an answer very soon. Romney has had four, five days, and he was asked four different times on the Schieffer program this weekend what he wanted to do, and he wouldn't answer,' Reid said in reference to CBS's Face the Nation.\" Reid was in a mischievous mood. He channeled Washington Nationals outfielder Bryce Harper in answering a reporter's question as to whether the majority leader would bring the DREAM Act to a Senate floor vote to smoke out Republicans. \"That's a clown question, bro,\" Reid said, triggering a gale of journalistic laughter.",

Early indications suggest President Obama has a majority of voters on his side with his decision to defer deportation proceedings for young illegal immigrants who meet certain conditions. A Bloomberg News poll found 64 percent of voters agreeing with Obama's decision to order a stop, for now, to deportation efforts against young immigrants who entered the U.S. illegally as children. Among the conditions, young people who are 30 or under would have to have lived in the U.S. continually for five years, as well as be in school or have graduated high school, or served in the military. In essence, the president put into place some aspects of the broader DREAM Act that has been stalled in Congress. The same poll showed 30 percent of voters opposed to Obama's decision. Meanwhile, a Rasmussen poll, which, unlike Bloomberg, used an automated telephone survey, roughly tracked with the Bloomberg poll. Rasmussen found that 71 percent of voters it surveyed backed Obama's decision. Importantly, the Bloomberg poll found that a key voter bloc, political independents, favored the Obama approach by a 2-to-1 margin. The polls suggest that if there's a risk for either presidential candidate, it would be for Mitt Romney, the all-but-official Republican nominee, and not Obama. Over the weekend, Romney criticized the president's decision to take executive action as an election-year political move, but was vague on what he would do if he were in the Oval Office. In an interview with CBS News' Bob Schieffer broadcast Sunday, Romney wouldn't say whether he would undo the president's action.",

            "article_content": "Over the weekend, Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney continued his Every Town Counts bus tour, traveling through Pennsylvania and Ohio. He's visiting states that went for Obama in 2008 but gave Republicans big victories in the 2012 mid-term elections.  LINDA WERTHEIMER, HOST: While President Obama is in Mexico, his Republican presidential challenger will continue a bus tour of key battleground states. Over the weekend, Mitt Romney visited small towns in states including New Hampshire, Pennsylvania and Ohio. And as NPR's Mara Liasson reports, Romney also faced questions on his immigration policy. MARA LIASSON, BYLINE: Romney took a brief detour from his bus trip to sit for an interview with CBS' \"Face the Nation\" yesterday. He was asked five separate times for his response to President Obama's decision to stop deporting young illegal immigrants. But each time, Romney refused to say whether he would repeal that policy. (SOUNDBITE OF TV SHOW, \"FACE THE NATION\") LIASSON: Because Romney had promised during the primaries to veto similar legislation, called the Dream Act, it sounded like he was now trying to find a way to reverse his position without actually saying so, since so many Republicans view the new approach as amnesty. UNIDENTIFIED MAN: Romney - the bus is here. (SOUNDBITE OF CHEERING) LIASSON: On the bus trip, there was no talk about immigration, just Romney's basic argument against President Obama. : His last campaign, he had a slogan. It was about hope and change. Now he's hoping to change the subject. (LAUGHTER) : All right? He doesn't want you to be thinking about his record. LIASSON: Romney's bus tour is traveling off the beaten path by design, hitting small towns where a presidential candidate and his entourage are a real novelty. Ann Gangwer was at Romney's first event in Weatherly, Pennsylvania in the Lehigh Valley at a foundry that makes industrial parts. ANN GANGWER: When my husband first told me he was coming to Weatherly, I thought he was pulling my leg. It's amazing. LIASSON: These rural areas also happen to be home to the weakest demographic link in President Obama's electoral coalition - white working-class voters. If Romney can win big majorities of these voters, he might be able to pry away one of the states the president absolutely has to win - Pennsylvania or Michigan or Wisconsin. (SOUNDBITE OF A CROWD) UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN #1: Do you have any juice? UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN #2: Yeah. UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN #3: Did you go over here? LIASSON: In Brunswick, Ohio Greg Juchum under the pancake tent at a Romney breakfast. Juchum is a manager at the local power company. He says he's a committed Republican, but a lot of the people he works with are not. GREG JUCHUM: When Obama won the presidency, a lot of the guys supported him. And for the first time in all of my years working for a union shop, all the union people are leaning towards Romney. Not all of them, but I'm going to say 75 percent of the hundreds of people that work for me, and that is major. LIASSON: Polls show the president getting the support of only a third of non-college whites. And with factory output shrinking again and consumer confidence dropping to a six month low, that support could erode further giving Romney an even bigger opening. A bus tour like this is supposed to be carefully choreographed but sometimes the campaign has to improvise. Romney was scheduled to meet voters Saturday at a Wawa convenience store in Quakertown, Pennsylvania. But after a crowd of Democratic protesters assembled there, the campaign bus changed plans and headed to a different Wawa nearby, where Romney was so impressed by the touch-screen ordering system that he worked it into his stump speech. : It is touch that and, you know, the sandwich comes. You press this, touch this, touch this, go pay the cashier there. There's your sandwich. It's amazing. People in the private-sector have learned how to compete. It's time to bring some competition to the federal government and to get it smaller... (SOUNDBITE OF CHEERING) LIASSON: Romney managed to sidestep the protesters in Quakertown, Pennsylvania but not in Troy, Ohio where they greeted him loudly. UNIDENTIFIED GROUP: Go home, Romney. Go home, Romney... : She was the one that you're going to run again. I said, Ann, let's talk about... UNIDENTIFIED GROUP: Go home, Romney. Go home, Romney... LIASSON: Romney cut his stump speech short to about five minutes, then he went across the street with House speaker John Boehner for some cheeseburgers, and the kind of forced humor that happens when a presidential candidate tries to do something normal, like order dinner in front of the press pool. : Are we going to order some food? Is that the idea? SENATOR JOHN BOEHNER: I'll take care of the ordering. : Oh, all right. (LAUGHTER) : As long as I take care of the bill? (LAUGHTER) BOEHNER: I'll take care of the bill, too... LIASSON: Today, it's on to another state Romney would like to wrest out of the Democratic column, Wisconsin. Republicans are bullish on the Badger State after Republican Governor Scott Walker beat a recall attempt earlier this month. Romney will be in Janesville with House Budget Committee Chairman Paul Ryan, a hero to conservatives and a possible vice presidential nominee. Mara Liasson, NPR News.

President Obama's decision to stop deporting young, otherwise law-abiding illegal immigrants could help rebuild his support among electorally important Latinos after 18 months of futile efforts, some activists said Friday. \"There is overwhelming support for the protection of these children, as there is in the rest of the country. I think this could have an energizing effect on Latino voters,\" says Clarissa Martinez del Castro, director of immigration and national campaigns for National Council of La Raza. Del Castro is one of many immigrant advocates who earlier this week declared Obama's previous efforts to reduce deportations a failure. Most of them on Friday applauded his new plan. But the initiative stops well short of Obama's 2008 campaign promise to overhaul the immigration system and doesn't measure up to the DREAM Act, which failed in the Senate in 2010 and began to erode Latinos' enthusiasm for Obama. And some immigration advocates spoke out against the move. Mohammed Abdollahi, an organizer with DreamActivist.org in Michigan, said his group initially was excited, until learning the details. He notes that the policy doesn't guarantee any applicants relief from deportation. He says it merely reinforces a year-old initiative widely criticized for having failed in its goal of slowing deportations. \"What we've been asking for is an executive order from President Obama mandating that deportations of DREAM act-eligible people be stopped,\" Abdollahi said, speaking by phone from the Obama campaign's office in Dearborn, Mich., where he and other activists were staging a sit-in as protest. \"We know that local [immigration enforcement] officers are not going to follow by this memo.\" Conservative Republicans in Congress and advocates of stricter immigration enforcement denounced the plan as backdoor amnesty and said Obama has overstepped his authority. But Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney was measured in his criticism of Obama: \"I believe the status of young people who come here through no fault of their own is an important matter to be considered and should be solved on a long-term basis, so they know what their future would be in this country,\" he said. \"I think the action that the president took today makes it more difficult to reach that long-term solution because an executive order is, of course, just a short-term matter \u2014 it can be reversed by subsequent presidents,\" Romney said in a statement from the campaign trail. \"I'd like to see legislation that deals with this issue, and I happen to agree with Marco Rubio as he looked at this issue. He said that this is an important matter, that we have to find a long-term solution, but that the president's action makes reaching a long-term solution more difficult. If I'm president, we'll do our very best to have that kind of long-term solution that provides certainty and clarity for the people who come into this country through no fault of their own by virtue of the action of their parents.\" Romney pursued the toughest positions on immigration among the GOP primary candidates, advocating a border fence, vowing to veto the Dream Act and tapping as an adviser Kansas Secretary of State Kris Kobach, who helped craft laws cracking down on illegal immigrants in Arizona and other states. The Arizona law, which Romney once called a \"model\" policy, is currently before the U.S. Supreme Court. The GOP candidate has since steered clear of the issue. He has said he'd review Florida Sen. Marco Rubio's alternate DREAM Act proposal. And his statement on Obama's directive notably didn't indicate whether he'd reverse it. Roy Beck, president of NumbersUSA, which favors limiting the flow of immigration, released a statement calling the administration's move \"unconstitutional\": \"President Obama thwarted the will of Congress and shunned the 20 million under and unemployed Americans by announcing he will grant work permits to 2-3 million illegal workers.\" Republican Rep. Steve King of Iowa, the vice chairman of the House immigration subcommittee, suggested the policy shift would hurt Obama's reelection bid: \"Americans should be outraged that President Obama is planning to usurp the Constitutional authority of the United States Congress and grant amnesty by edict to 1 million illegal aliens. ... I believe the American people will reject President Obama for his repeated efforts to violate the Constitutional separation of powers.\" Darry Sragow, a lawyer and longtime Democratic strategist based in Los Angeles, said the president's move puts Romney in a difficult position. \"His base is not going to like what the president just did, but he can't win in November by tacking hard to the right,\" Sragow said. Ed Rogers, a Republican lobbyist and campaign strategist who served in the first Bush White House, said Obama's plan is \"a clumsy effort ... to put himself above the law.\" He said the move reflects \"sheer gall,\" noting that it comes the week before Obama and Romney are scheduled to address the National Association of Latino Elected and Appointed Officials in Orlando, Fla. Rogers recommended that Romney clarify his own position on illegal immigration and \"clean up some of the damage done during the primary season when his opponents wanted to paint him further to the right than he really is.\" Strategists in both parties believe the election could come down to a handful of battleground states, particularly where large Latino populations have the potential to deliver the decision margin. Multiple polls show Obama holds a wide advantage among Latino voters. A poll last month had Obama leading Romney among Latino registered voters, 61 percent to 27 percent. But many Democrats and Hispanic leaders say the Obama administration's immigration policies \u2014 especially the deportation of a record 1.1 million people in three years \u2014 has alienated Latinos, and they can't be taken for granted. And they argue that Obama can't afford slippage of Latino support given his weakened support among some white voters. Some polls have found that Latinos' support for Obama has softened significantly and that their enthusiasm for this election is weak. And the number of Hispanic registered voters has declined 5 percent since 2008, to about 11 million.",

President Obama's announcement Friday that he is using his executive authority to defer deportation proceedings for young immigrants who entered the U.S. illegally but meet certain requirements was just the latest example of the president's use of his power to act without Congress on policy issues. And like the other actions the president has increasingly taken as part of his \"We Can't Wait\" initiative, the decision announced Friday was characterized by Obama's political opponents as an abuse of power and violation of congressional prerogatives. All of which goes to prove that Obama has reached the stage in his presidency, like so many of his predecessors, where his frustration with congressional inaction has led him to act unilaterally. William Howell, a political scientist at the University of Chicago who wrote Power Without Persuasion: The Politics Of Direct Presidential Action, said in an interview: \"The boundaries of presidential power are constantly being negotiated and renegotiated. This is very typical. In some ways the option itself may be atypical. We haven't seen presidents issue this particular kind of policy initiative on their own before. But all the time, presidents are pushing out on the boundaries of their power and claiming new authority. And their ability to actually secure that authority crucially depends on how the two other branches of government respond. \"So the idea that presidential power is fixed and static is a deep misnomer. It mischaracterizes both the long trajectory of presidential power over time and it also mischaracterizes what the founders themselves had in mind. They fully expected various branches of government to be pushing and pulling.\" Howell ties Obama's more forceful and unilateral approach \u2014 his change from attempting to reach compromise with congressional Republicans to going it alone \u2014 to last summer's debacle over raising the debt ceiling. Howell said: \"He really got beaten up over that. Because he was perceived as not providing the kind of leadership and initiative and drive that we expect of a president. And since then he has said repeatedly 'Look, if Congress won't act, then I will.' And you have seen him in a variety of areas, take the area of education, unilaterally stepping in and issuing waivers to the most binding provisions of No Child Left Behind to states, on the basis of their willingness to adopt policies that he likes. \"It's really an extraordinary move because he's allowing states to opt out of some pieces of federal legislation so long as they adopt policy initiatives to his liking. And this is an area where Congress has just dropped the ball. The reauthorization has been up for years. For four years they've just taken a pass each year. \"Immigration is another one of these policies where Congress is effectively stuck. We saw that with [George W.] Bush where he tried to engage Congress and introduce comprehensive immigration legislation and he was beaten up over it. I think in this sort of policy area, this is going to be the wave of the future. [Presidents are] going to say, these are small incremental moves but they're going to do it on their own.\" A New York Times story in April, in which Howell was quoted, relates how Obama decided to use his executive power instead of allowing all potential policy initiatives to be stymied by a gridlocked Congress for the rest of his time in office. A meeting sometime last fall between the president and his senior aides was apparently where the plan came together, with Obama actually being the one who came up with the \"We Can't Wait\" name for the effort. As usually happens when a president uses executive orders or other powers to advance a controversial policy objective, the Obama announcement drew criticism from Republicans, who accused him of crossing the line into congressional power. Even though Sen. Marco Rubio of Florida, who is sometimes mentioned as a GOP vice presidential possibility, has his own proposed legislative version of the DREAM Act \u2014 which bears strong similarities to the president's order \u2014 he criticized Obama on Friday: \"Today's announcement will be welcome news for many of these kids desperate for an answer, but it is a short-term answer to a long-term problem. And by once again ignoring the Constitution and going around Congress, this short-term policy will make it harder to find a balanced and responsible long-term one.\" Rep. Steve King of Iowa, an immigration hard-liner, said in a statement: \"Americans should be outraged that President Obama is planning to usurp the Constitutional authority of the United States Congress and grant amnesty by edict to 1 million illegal aliens,\" said King. \"There is no ambiguity in Congress about whether the DREAM Act's amnesty program should be the law of the land. It has been rejected by Congress, and yet President Obama has decided that he will move forward with it anyway. President Obama, an ex constitutional law professor, whose favorite word is audacity, is prepared to violate the principles of Constitutional Law that he taught.\" King is consistent in his opposition to federal immigration enforcement changes that lean toward more leniency; he opposed the reform efforts of President George W. Bush in 2006. Some of the opposition in coming days will no doubt be partisan, however, Howell notes: \"There will be some people who will cry foul. Who will say this is a gross abuse of the president's Article II powers. But that, too, has always been true when presidents strike out on their own and act unilaterally. \"The people who cry foul are typically, not always, but typically members of the opposite party who don't like the policy that the president's advancing. \"You would expect Republicans to scream and holler about an abuse of executive authority when the president does this in the same way the Democrats were doing that when Bush was in office. At its base, this is about partisan politics that assumes the language of concerns about the Constitution. But what's driving people to speak out, really, is just opposition to the policies themselves. \" And some of those policies are the stuff of history books, whether it was Obama's immediate predecessor signing an executive order authorizing warrantless surveillance by the National Security Agency following Sept. 11 or, going back decades earlier, President Harry S. Truman's racial integration of the military by executive order. President Abraham Lincoln used his executive power to sign the Emancipation Proclamation while President Thomas Jefferson used his for the Louisiana Purchase. And there were members of Congress who expressed outrage each and every time. They have another option available to them, however, Howell said: \"When members of Congress scream and holler about Obama taking certain actions on immigration policy, it's within their power to do something about it. They can enact a statute that would overturn or amend, whatever it is that Obama's doing. So in my mind calls by members of Congress to exercise self-restraint really ring hollow.\"",

While the appearences \u2014 both delivered in Ohio; Obama in Cleaveland, Romney in Cincinatti \u2014 were billed as dueling speeches scheduled for roughly the same time slot, the campaigns moved things around and the president delivered a much longer address right after Romney finished speaking. In his address, Romney took shots at Obama for not delivering a recovery. He painted the president as being the \"enemy\" of business. The president is taking the nation on a path to be \"more and more like Europe, with a bigger and bigger government taking more from the American people,\" Romney said. The Romney prescription, he said, is for \"entrepreneurship ... innovation ... job creation ... economic vitality.\" Romney restated that his road to recovery would involve tapping American energy, repealing Obama's signature healthcare law, and paying down the deficit. President Obama made the case that he and Romney agree on one thing: The economy will be the issue in this campaign. He said this November, the choice is not \"whether we pay down our deficit, but how.\" Do we give rich guys like him and Romney a tax cut, Obama said, and take away the \"guarantee of basic security for the\" elderly and sick or cut financial aid for students? Obama said those questions have caused a stalemate in Congress. He has a clear vision and so does Romney. \"The only thing that can break the stalemate is you,\" said Obama. \"This November is a chance to render a verdict.\" We live blogged the two speeches. If you want a play-by-play, keep reading. OBAMA, 2:53 p.m. ET. Asking For A Mandate: Wrapping up his speech, Obama returns to a theme he touched upon earlier. He said this November, the choice is not \"whether we pay down our deficit, but how.\" Do we give rich guys like him and Romney a tax cut, and take away the \"gurantee of basic security for the\" elderly and sick or cut financial aid for students? Romney and \"his allies in Congress\" disagree with him, he said. That's why they've failed to move forward on any economic plan. \"The only thing that can break the stalemate is you,\" said Obama. \"This November is a chance to render a verdict.\" In closing, Obama said this was the electorate's chance to give someone a mandate. And if voters agree with him that government is not the problem and that the market can't fix all the country's problems, then they should give him a second term. OBAMA, 2:48 p.m. ET. Some Specifics: Obama delivers some specifics on his economic plan: -- Now is not the time to turn our backs on supporting innovation, he says. The government should invest in educating and training Americans for high tech jobs, he said. -- \"Now is the time to rebuild America,\" he said. -- Obama said he would take half of the money \"we're saving on the war ... and do some nation building here at home.\" -- He said to attract businesses to the United States, government must provide the \"the highways, run ways and broadband access.\" -- \"It's time to take on fiscal problems in an honest, balanced, responsible manner,\" said Obama. -- He said it's time to return to the Clinton years when the wealthiest paid more but \"the economy was booming.\" OBAMA, 2:34 p.m. ET. A Shared Vision: In the post World War II U.S., said Obama, Republicans and Democrats shared a vision that the market can't \"solve all its problems on its own\" and that the government is responsible for \"consumer protection.\" \"In the last century this consensus ... led to a shared prosperity,\" Obama said. He said that vision led to his policy decisions, including his healthcare overhaul and Wall Street reform. He said that post WWII vision was shared by the GOP. But, now, the Republican party has given that up for a view that \"government is the enemy.\" \"That shared vision,\" said Obama, is what he \"intends to carry forward as President.\" OBAMA, 2:28 p.m. ET. Obama's Vision: The president says he believes in paying down the national debt, but not on the on the backs of the poor and middle class, he said. Then he hit back against criticism that he believes government is responsible for creating jobs. He said he doesn't believe \"government is the answer to all our problems.\" Obama said he passed fewer regulations than his predecessor and cut taxes for most Americans. OBAMA, 2:21 p.m. ET. The Republican Plan: Obama said \"there is nothing new\" in the Republican plans for the economy. He quoted Bill Clinton saying it was the old approaches, \"only on steroids.\" He said if people believe the way to prosperity is to cut taxes for the rich and cut spending to a level \"not seen in modern times,\" they should vote for Romney. \"He is qualified to deliver that plan,\" Obama said. He made those comments after telling the audience that under the Romney plan, many of them would be paying higher taxes to subsidize tax cuts for the rich. \"Why would we think that [those policies] would work better this time?\" Obama said. OBAMA, 2:17 p.m. ET. This Election Should Be About How: \"Of course the economy isn't where it needs to be,\" Obama said. The debate in this election should be \"how\" we move the country to prosperity. OBAMA, 2:13 p.m. ET. Defending His Record: Now the president pivots into a defense of his record. First, he notes, many countries usually recover from a deep recession at a slower pace. He notes that European austerity has failed to move those countries into positive territory. \"Our economy started growing six months after I took office,\" said Obama. OBAMA, 2:10 p.m. ET. Prosperity \"Never Trickled Down\": Obama is now making the case that the policies put in place during the Bush years \u2014 tax cuts, two wars \u2014 was a failure for the middle class. \"Prosperity,\" he said, \"never trickled down to the middle class.\" \"For the rich it worked out well,\" he said. But the middle class suffered. OBAMA, 2:07 p.m. ET. Break The Stalemate: Obama says the thing that is holding this country back is the stalemate in Washington. It's a stalemate he said between \"two tremendously different views\" on how to get the economy back in order. \"This election,\" he said, \" is your chance to break the stalemate.\" OBAMA, 2:02 p.m. ET. Many Differences But Agree On One Thing: \"This election is about our economic future,\" said Obama, adding that while there are many differences between the parties this is one thing he agrees with his opponent about. Obama says the economy is the \"defining issue of our time.\" ROMNEY, 1:57 p.m. ET. European Model? The GOP candidate returns to a theme he hits often \u2014 that the president is taking the nation on a path to be \"more and more like Europe, with a bigger and bigger government taking more from the American people.\" His prescription, Romney says, is for \"entrepreneurship ... innovation ... job creation ... economic vitality.\" And with that, his address is over. It was, as you'll see if you read down through our updates, very much a campaign address that hit broad themes and familiar criticisms of Obama's record. ROMNEY, 1:55 p.m. ET. \"The Land Of Opportunity\": After telling a story about an businesswoman in Las Vegas who has started a furniture company, Romney extols America as \"the land of opportunity ... [and] the home of dreamers.\" ROMNEY, 1:52 p.m. ET. Repeal \"Obamacare,\" Cut The Debt: Romney repeats his pledges to \"get rid of Obamacare\" and to put the federal government on a path toward a balanced budget. ROMNEY, 1:50 p.m. ET. On Energy: \"I happen to like the sources of energy that we have in abundance,\" Romney says, \"oil, coal and natural gas.\" ROMNEY, 1:48 p.m. ET. If You Think Things Are Fine, Obama's Your Guy: Returning to the president's comment on Friday that the private sector is doing \"fine,\" Romney says that if you agree, \"then he's the guy to vote for.\" But Obama, he says, has been \"long on words and short on actions that created jobs.\" ROMNEY, 1:47 p.m. ET. \"Enormous Opportunities\" In Latin America: Assailing a lack of trade pacts with countries in Latin America, Romney says there are \"enormous opportunities\" there for U.S. companies. ROMNEY, 1:44 p.m. ET. Employers Think Obama Sees Them As The Enemy: He's talked to small employers and big employers all across the country, Romney says, and they think Obama \"sees them as their enemy.\" They feel like the health care overhaul, the financial regulatory bill known as Dodd-Frank and the administration's energy policies have worked against businesses' interests. ROMNEY, 1:40 p.m. ET. Obama \"Hasn't Delivered\": As he starts, Romney says he's heard that the president is delivering a speech about the economy \"on the other side of the state.\" \"He's doing that because he hasn't delivered a recovery for the economy,\" Romney says.",

The Obama campaign is wooing Hispanics ahead of the November elections, but the president's deportation policy is being criticized by immigrant advocates.\n                \n                    \n                    Charles Dharapak/AP\n                    \n                \nhide caption Audience members listen to President Obama speak about immigration reform in El Paso, Texas, in May 2011. The Obama campaign is wooing Hispanics ahead of the November elections, but the president's deportation policy is being criticized by immigrant advocates. Criticism of the Obama administration's deportation policies continues to pour in as previously supportive groups called the latest government effort a failure. Immigrant advocates on Monday condemned the administration's recent findings that a policy designed to reduce the deportations of otherwise law-abiding illegal immigrants has had almost no effect. An ongoing government review has found that fewer than 2 percent of the more than 400,000 pending deportation cases have been halted. The government says thousands more cases will be closed, but critics say the paltry results so far expose an unwillingness among immigration agents to enforce the new policy. \"We were quite hopeful that the new policies would usher in a new era of humane enforcement,\" Frank Sharry, executive director of America's Voice Education Fund, told reporters on a conference call with other advocacy groups. \"A year later, we are sad to declare that the implementation of this policy is failing. [It] has not made this better and to some extent has made it worse.\" A year ago, the Obama administration announced a shift in focus to the deportation of convicted criminals, people who pose \"a clear risk to national security\" and others who defraud the visa system. U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement issued memorandums granting its agents \"prosecutorial discretion\" to extend leniency to DREAM Act-eligible people and others with clean records. Leniency was to take several forms, including deferred deportation, which could last for up to 12 months, at which time individuals could request an extension and potentially reapply every year. Another option was the authorization of people to work in the U.S. legally. The Obama administration's immigration policies have drawn criticism from all sides. Republicans say the administration is trying to circumvent immigration laws to grant amnesty and blocked the Senate's passage of the DREAM Act bill in 2010. (The DREAM Act would establish a path to citizenship for young people brought to the U.S. illegally as children provided that they attend college or serve in the military.) Immigrant advocates and Latino leaders have criticized Obama for increasing the pace of deportations beyond that of the Bush administration. The Obama administration's tougher enforcement has led to the deportation of a record 1.1 million people in the last three years. The deportations have compounded Latinos' frustrations over Obama's failure to fulfill his 2008 campaign promise of pushing an immigration overhaul through Congress, as well as the failed DREAM Act. Last week, ICE Director John Morton told NPR's Weekend Edition Saturday that the targeting of serious criminal offenders is driving the deportation numbers. He said roughly 216,000 criminals were removed last year. But immigrant advocates say the stepped-up enforcement continues to target people who are supposed to be protected under the new policy. They say ICE isn't effectively applying its newfound discretion, in part by declining to offer the full range of options called for in the new policy even though people in a majority of cases meet the standards. Crystal Williams, executive director of the American Immigration Lawyers Association, said on the call that most people are being offered administrative closure without the option to obtain work: \"It's putting your file on a shelf. That's it. No other possibilities are being offered, like the settlement of cases, adjustment of status.\" As a result, critics say, the new policy likely will clear no more than 5 percent of the cases.",

Declaring that a \"national emergency\" exists in public education, presumptive Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney shifted from his usual economic message to outline his education platform during a speech to a Latino business group Wednesday. Romney pledged to provide federal funding for \"every\" child from low-income families, or those with special needs, to attend the public, public charter or, in some cases, private school of their parents' choice. The proposals are boilerplate Republican Party planks. \"Instead of just giving lip service to improving our schools, I will actually put the kids first and the [teachers] union behind in giving our kids better teachers, better options and better choices for a better future,\" said Romney. Romney was addressing the annual economic summit of the Latino Coalition, held at the U.S. Chamber of Commerce. After the economy, most Latinos in many polls identify education as their most important issue. Romney's message received a warm reception, particularly when he criticized the Obama administration's education policies. \"This president receives the lion's share of funding from organized labor, and the teachers' unions represent a massive source of funding for the Democratic Party,\" Romney said. \"The challenge with that is when it comes to actual reform to make schools better for our kids, they talk a good game, but they don't do it.\" Romney has turned his focus recently to making inroads with Latinos, the nation's largest minority group and fastest-growing group of voters. He's climbing a steep hill. Romney angered many Latinos with his pledge to veto the Dream Act, if elected. The legislation, which failed in the Senate last year, would create a path to citizenship for young adults brought to America as children if they attend college or serve in the military. Romney also has called Arizona's strict immigration enforcement law \u2014 which has been appealed to the U.S. Supreme Court \u2014 a \"model\" for the nation. In 2008, Obama won 67 percent of the Latino vote. On Wednesday, a new NBC News/Wall Street Journal/Telemundo poll of Latino respondents showed Obama leading Romney 61 percent to 27 percent. Conventional political wisdom is that Romney must significantly cut into Obama's support among Latinos to have a chance at victory. Last week, Romney visited Florida, where Latinos make up 13 percent of registered voters, and released his first television ads of the general election, including a Spanish-language version. The 30-second spot, \"Day One\" or \"D\u00eda Uno,\" outlines the three actions Romney would take in his first day in office: approve the Keystone XL oil pipeline; cut taxes and enact reforms to help \"job creators\"; and end \"Obamacare.\" Except for creating jobs, these promises don't match with Latinos' priorities, polls show. Latinos generally rank the economy and jobs first, followed by education, with immigration overhaul placing third or fourth, depending on the poll. Polls also show that a majority of Latinos favor Obama's health care law. Ruth Sandoval, a self-employed management consultant who attended the speech, said she was pleased that Romney addressed education, given its importance to Latinos. \"The highest dropout rates are with Hispanics. Unless we have our community educated, we'll have a community on welfare,\" Sandoval said. Romney's business background would be \"valuable\" in the White House, Sandoval said, adding that she's \"not concerned\" about the Obama campaign's attacks on Romney's record running Bain Capital: \"I can't be mad at somebody for making money. That's everybody's dream.\" She added that no matter which candidate wins, \"I think we're in for a long haul\" before the economy recovers.",

If young voters were the breakout stars of the 2008 presidential election, then Latino voters may take center stage this year. Every other week or so, it seems, a new poll gauges Latinos' opinions about the candidates, the issues and their level of engagement. Both parties are pouring millions into their Latino outreach. Latino politicians have assumed prominent roles in the conventions of the Republican and Democratic parties. And a Latino senator is on the short list of potential running mates for presumptive Republican nominee Mitt Romney. Latino voters arguably never have received this much attention so early in a presidential election. It's a new reality for America's largest minority group and fastest growing bloc of voters. But, for Latino advocates, the heightened interest won't matter much if their concerns don't move to the front burners of the two parties. \"If you are truly looking to be competitive at the national level, there's no way you can continue on the path of ignoring Latino voters,\" says Clarissa Martinez, director of immigration and national campaigns for National Council of La Raza, the oldest Latino civil rights group in the U.S. \"Latinos now are asking the question, 'OK, so what are you going to do? We appreciate you stopping by. We had the pictures [taken]. We had the words in Spanish [from candidates]. When do we get to the policy stands that are actually acted upon?' \" A Focus Beyond Immigration Latinos are frustrated with both parties for failing to enact an immigration overhaul, one of candidate Barack Obama's 2008 campaign promises. They are also angry at the Obama administration for processing a record number of deportations over the past three years. On Thursday, coordinated protests planned in presidential battleground states will demand that Obama exempt Dream Act-eligible young people from deportation. (The Dream Act, which failed to pass the Senate last year, would provide a path to citizenship for young people brought illegally to the U.S. as children if they attend college or serve in the military.) Education is another issue important to Latinos but not prominent so far on the campaign trail. A poll released Tuesday, by the American Federation for Children and the Hispanic Council for Reform and Educational Options, found that 58 percent of Latinos in five battleground states want to \"hear more from the presidential candidates on how they will improve education.\" By comparison, only 49 percent of all respondents agreed. \"There's much more to gaining ground with Latino voters than immigration,\" Albert Collazo, spokesman for Hispanic CREO, told reporters. Latinos polled also ranked the economy and jobs as their top concerns, followed by the federal deficit and education. There's much more to gaining ground with Latino voters than immigration. Albert Collazo, spokesman for Hispanic CREO An estimated 22 million or more Hispanics will be eligible to vote in 2012. Many projections put their voter turnout in November as high as 12 million, which would be a record and a 26 percent increase from 2008. Latinos could be especially important in battleground states with large Hispanic populations, such as Florida, Nevada, New Mexico and Colorado, where their strong turnouts on Election Day could determine outcomes in congressional races as well as the presidential contest. \"I think Latinos have been accustomed to the attention of candidates since the late 1990s and then them disappearing after,\" says Stanford University political scientist Gary Segura, a principal in the polling group Latino Decisions. \"The 2012 emphasis may be a function of what happened in 2010 \u2014 the only places where Republicans lost [elections] were in places with huge Latino numbers, like in Colorado, California and Nevada.\" Unprecedented Steps To Reach Latinos President Obama was the first in U.S. history to win the office without capturing a majority of white voters. Given his unpopularity among white men, he's pinning his re-election hopes again on a coalition anchored by African-Americans, young people and Latinos. Recent polls have shown Obama's support among Latinos hovering above 70 percent. The Democrats have built a formidable advantage with Latinos since 2004, when President George W. Bush received 44 percent of Latino votes, an unusually large share for a Republican. That year Democratic nominee John Kerry got 53 percent of Latino votes. In 2008, President Obama received 67 percent of Latino votes. Romney is hoping to repair his party's relationship with Latinos enough to skim away support that offsets Obama's advantage. An impreMedia and Latino Decisions poll from December found 46 percent of Latinos believe Republicans \"don't care too much\" about them, primarily because Republicans, including Romney, generally support tough immigration enforcement and oppose creating a path to citizenship. Republicans hope their efforts to cast Obama's economic policies as a failure will resonate with Latinos, whose unemployment rate is at 10.3 percent, compared with 8.1 percent for the nation. To that end, the Republican National Committee is taking unprecedented steps. The RNC created the position of director of Hispanic outreach and filled it with Bettina Inclan, who previously ran the Republican National Hispanic Assembly. Last week, the RNC announced another first for the party by naming Hispanic outreach directors for six battleground states: Colorado, Florida, Nevada, New Mexico, North Carolina and Virginia. And the Republican State Leadership Committee is investing $3 million into the recruitment of 100 Hispanic candidates for state legislative seats across the nation in 2012. The Obama campaign and the Democratic Party have robust outreach machines that are beginning to crank up. Last week, the Obama campaign released a second set of Spanish-language ads playing on television and radio in Colorado, Nevada and Florida \u2014 three battlegrounds where Latinos could make the difference. Taking A Cue From Gay Rights Activists Some Latinos see progress in their issues getting addressed. One example is the Obama administration's decision last year to adjust deportation guidelines to prioritize a smaller pool of illegal immigrants \u2014 those who have committed serious crimes. And Republicans are trying to moderate their harsh rhetoric on illegal immigration. Sen. Marco Rubio of Florida recently floated details of his own version of the Democrat-supported Dream Act. Rubio, the son of Cuban immigrants and rumored to be a possible Romney running mate, says he's drafting a bill that would issue nonimmigrant visas rather than citizenship. \"You're seeing more of a consumer-based vote \u2014 the Latino isn't just being addressed; he's being accommodated, even on the immigration issue,\" says Democratic strategist Gus Garcia, who co-chaired Latino outreach for Hillary Clinton's 2008 presidential campaign. \"It's the pressure from the community driving them to come up with policies that address Latinos.\" Garcia says Latino leaders took note of Obama's announced support for same-sex marriage as evidence that he gave in to gay rights advocates, demonstrating that if Latinos continue to lobby Obama, \"he can be pressured to make a change.\"",

The event, co-hosted by gay- and lesbian-rights leaders and a Latino nonprofit, featured singer Ricky Martin. President Obama is attending a campaign fundraiser Monday night co-hosted by gay- and lesbian-rights leaders and a Latino nonprofit. The event is being headlined by singer Ricky Martin. Obama maintains a commanding lead over likely GOP presidential nominee Mitt Romney when it comes to support among Latino voters. But those same voters are generally regarded as socially conservative, leading some to wonder how the president's support for same-sex marriage might affect the Latino electorate. Roberto Ordenana, a 35-year-old native San Franciscan and LGBT activist, was on his way to work when he first got the news of the president's announcement. Days later, the memory of that moment makes Ordenana smile like he's won the lottery. \"When I heard about it, I was completely elated,\" he says. \"I was taken by surprise, and immediately I just felt an incredible sense of pride.\" Ordenana says he immediately called his parents, whom he describes as being like the president \u2014 in other words, their thinking has \"evolved\" from the days when he first came out at the age of 19. \"They have openly met my friends and accepted them into our family,\" Ordenana says. \"At the same time, they go to church every Sunday morning. And so they're able to hold both their religious beliefs and also the knowledge that LGBT individuals should be treated equally.\" No one would suggest that the acceptance Ordenana found with his family is universal in other Latino families or the community at large. But his story might challenge a commonly held assumption that goes like this: Latinos have socially conservative views on religion and family; therefore, Obama's statement won't play well with Latino voters. \"I will be very surprised if this lessens his support among Latino voters at all,\" says Luis Fraga, who teaches political science at the University of Washington. Not High On The List Fraga says there's no evidence that Latino voters favor traditional moral or social values over bread-and-butter issues. \"A very important issue for Latino voters is immigration,\" Fraga says. \"The president has come out very strongly in favor of comprehensive immigration reform and the DREAM Act. That is a far more important issue to Latino voters, as are jobs and the economy, than are issues associated with same-sex marriage.\" Still, opponents of gay marriage within the Latino community made it clear they weren't happy with the president's statement. The Rev. Sam Rodriguez of the California-based National Hispanic Christian Leadership Conference told Fox News Latino: \"This is about the government saying, 'We are going to hijack a religious doctrine and change it for you.' \" From New York, the Rev. Gabriel Salguero of the National Latino Evangelical Coalition echoed that protest. \"There is real concern about the church's freedom to define marriage within its own religious liberty issue ... and we're looking really closely [at] what the president's statements mean in terms of policy.\" 'Part Of Our Families' Still, Salguero isn't prepared to call the president's statement a deal breaker for Hispanic evangelical voters. Polls suggest that Latino views on same-sex marriage are aligned with American public opinion in general \u2014 a slight but growing majority supports marriage equality, and strong outright opposition is minimal. \"You know, there's a lot of gay people in the Latino community, LGBT people in the Latino community, and they are part of our families,\" says Antonio Gonzalez, president of the William C. Velasquez Institute, a public policy and research group based in Texas. \"I think we're going through a self-education and sensitizing process just like everybody else.\" And he says even if the president loses some Latino votes on this issue, he is likely to make up for it with a re-energized gay and lesbian base.",

            "article_content": "Indiana Treasurer Richard Mourdock speaks to supporters in Indianapolis on Tuesday after defeating Sen. Richard Lugar in the state's Republican primary.\n                \n                    \n                    AJ Mast/AP\n                    \n                \nhide caption Indiana Treasurer Richard Mourdock speaks to supporters in Indianapolis on Tuesday after defeating Sen. Richard Lugar in the state's Republican primary. Richard Mourdock is the first to admit he's lacking in the political flash-and-dash department. \"I never got hit with the charisma stick when I was lying there in the nursery,\" the newly crowned Indiana Republican Senate candidate told NPR in a recent interview. But Mourdock, 60, who on Tuesday toppled six-term Republican Sen. Richard Lugar in a GOP primary, is a determined if not dynamic campaigner, those who know him say, and no newcomer to the trail. \"Richard Mourdock is right: He's not the most charismatic person, but he's the real deal,\" says Greg Fettig, co-founder of Hoosiers for a Conservative Senate, the group that rallied state and national Tea Party efforts to defeat Lugar. \"He doesn't get extremely excited, and he doesn't get really low,\" says Fettig, echoing Mourdock's description of himself to NPR as a \"pretty even-keeled person.\" His defeat of the venerable Lugar, 80, has put the largely unknown two-term state treasurer in the national spotlight. Democrats, sensing a sliver of opportunity in the fall race now that incumbent Lugar has been defeated, are scrambling to portray Mourdock as a fringe candidate, while his supporters double down on the candidate's sometimes teary commitment to hard-line fiscal conservatism. \"I think the race is going to be competitive,\" says Jack Colwell, a longtime political reporter and columnist at the South Bend Tribune. Rep. Joe Donnelly, the Democratic candidate, \"is a Blue Dog and a moderate,\" says Colwell, \"but with the makeup of the state, Mourdock is going to be the favorite.\" Mourdock also benefits from the top of the Republican ticket, which features popular Rep. Mike Pence running for governor \u2014 and from the Obama campaign's decision not to include Indiana in its working list of states where it plans to compete hard. And no one, say those who know him, should mistake Mourdock's low-key personality with a lack of conservative fervor. \"He would be a very conservative Republican in the Senate,\" says Leslie Lenkowsky, a professor of public affairs at Indiana University. Lenkowsky and others note that during an interview last month with the Indianapolis Star, Mourdock made what has become his most frequently cited assertion: \"We need less bipartisanship in Congress.\" Mourdock's positions mirror those of the Tea Party and the Republican Party's cultural conservative base. He advocates repeal of the president's health care law and a $7.6 trillion cut to federal spending over 10 years. He opposes the DREAM Act, wants Roe v. Wade overturned, and says he'd vote against \"activist liberal judges.\" He's against cap-and-trade solutions to environmental concerns, has an \"A\" rating from the National Rifle Association, and wants to eliminate the Internal Revenue Service and replace it with a \"consumption tax.\" The Frequent Candidate Though those in the Tea Party movement are apt to embrace nonpoliticians, Mourdock, a geologist whose pre-politics career included stints at the AMAX Coal Co. and the Standard Oil Co., has spent the better part of a quarter century running for office \u2014 frequently without success. Mourdock lost consecutive congressional bids in 1988, 1990 and 1992. He failed even to gain the Republican nomination in 1988, and lost in the general election in the next two cycles. In 2002, he ran unsuccessfully for his party's nomination for secretary of state. Richard Mourdock greets supporter Paul Wheeler early last year, before announcing he would seek Richard Lugar's U.S. Senate seat.\n                \n                    \n                    Tom Strattman/AP\n                    \n                \nhide caption Richard Mourdock greets supporter Paul Wheeler early last year, before announcing he would seek Richard Lugar's U.S. Senate seat. Mourdock, who has run nine marathons, including one on his 60th birthday, finally won office in 2006, when he was elected state treasurer with 52 percent of the vote. He was re-elected in 2010 with more than 62 percent of the vote. Fettig and other Mourdock partisans like to note that their guy was the state's leading vote-getter in the 2010 election, besting even successful GOP Senate candidate Dan Coats' vote tally. Colwell, the columnist, however, notes that Mourdock's Democratic opponent also got the most votes of any candidate in his party, a phenomenon likely due to the fact that, unlike in the Coats race, there was no Libertarian candidate competing in the state treasurer's race. (The Libertarian in the Senate race got 5 percent of the vote.) State treasurer, as in most states, is not a high-profile job in Indiana. Until Mourdock and his supporters started hitting the airwaves with anti-Lugar ads, he was best known for a lawsuit he filed against the Obama administration for its 2009 auto industry bailout. The unsuccessful effort claimed that three Indiana state funds invested in Chrysler did not get a fair shake in the administration's deal with Detroit. That lawsuit, while not sitting well with some in a state dependent on auto industry jobs, made Mourdock \"a rock star\" with Tea Party Republicans, Fettig says. Mourdock became a regular at Tea Party events, and headed to Washington by bus for the big 2009 rally at the Capitol. \"Richard Mourdock may not say he's Tea Party,\" Fettig says, \"but we know he is.\" A Questionable Comparison Democrats have raced to compare Mourdock with the disastrous Tea Party candidate Christine O'Donnell, who won Delaware's 2010 GOP Senate primary and lost badly in the general election. That comparison, however, will very likely prove a big stretch. \"The efforts to portray him as Christine O'Donnell, 'I'm not a witch,' are not accurate,\" says Colwell, making reference to O'Donnell's campaign ad that addressed her past assertion that she had dabbled in witchcraft. Mourdock is an experienced politician, twice elected to statewide office, and with support broader than just one corner of the party. \"This is a completely different dynamic,\" Fettig says. \"Richard Mourdock is embraced in the Republican Party. He is not some fringe element like Christine O'Donnell was.\" And Indiana is not Delaware. Mourdock was careful on primary night not to make too much of his Tea Party support in his victory speech, recognizing, Fettig says, that he doesn't want to be identified with just one group. In his interview with NPR's Tamara Keith, Mourdock says his style is that of a marathoner. \"These campaigns are not sprints,\" he said. \"I've run nine marathons, and one thing you learn is you never change your pace in the last two miles, you just keep going. \"We're just going to keep the same pace,\" he said. Dogged Days With Mourdock, an Ohio native who got his master's degree from Ball State University in Muncie, Ind., voters can expect to hear tough talk cloaked in a low-key delivery. He doesn't \"seem Tea Party,\" is how he's been described. Since winning the primary, he has characterized \"bipartisanship\" as Democrats coming over to the Republican point of view. (This comes on the heels of a state survey that suggests a large number of voters would like somebody who could reach across the aisle, Colwell notes.) Mourdock watchers are already debating whether, if elected to the Senate, he will be more like Tea Party firebrand Sen. Jim DeMint, R-S.C., or a more mainstream-by-current-standards conservative like Coats, Indiana's other senator. Coats, who had previously served a decade in the Senate during the 1990s, survived Tea Party opposition in 2010 and is now deemed acceptable by activists like Fettig. One guarantee is that Mourdock won't somehow transform himself into a firebrand. It's just not his style. And really, Lenkowsky says, that seems to be no problem in Indiana. \"It would be pretty hard to describe Dick Lugar as charismatic,\" he says, \"or Evan Bayh, or Dan Coats, or Mitch Daniels.\" Bayh is a former Democratic senator; Daniels is Indiana's Republican governor. Mourdock, Lenkowsky says, \"fits perfectly.\" NPR's Tamara Keith contributed to this story.",

            "article_content": "Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., the son of Cuban immigrants, has urged his fellow conservatives to soften their rhetoric on illegal immigration. Above, he makes a campaign stop with Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney on Monday in Aston, Pa.\n                \n                    \n                    Jessica Kourkounis/Getty Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption Florida Sen. Marco Rubio spent the week in the spotlight as the latest potential running mate for presumptive Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney. The Hispanic lawmaker, anointed as the party's best hope for appealing to more Latino voters, came loaded for bear \u2014 rolling out an alternative to the Democrats' Dream Act. Rubio has released few details of his plan to address illegal immigration, and says he wants to introduce a bill in the Senate in June. But, like the Democrat-backed version defeated by Senate Republicans in 2010, the legislation would help young people brought to the U.S. as children stay in the country legally if they attend college or serve in the military. By most estimates, between 800,000 and 1.2 million people would be eligible. The key distinction between the Rubio and Democratic plans is in how people would be legalized. The original act would put people on a path to citizenship. Rubio's plan would stop short by issuing non-immigrant visas allowing recipients to remain in the U.S. for college or military service. Rubio's critics say his plan would create a permanent second class of people unable to obtain the full rights of citizenship. Supporters, however, say visa recipients could still apply for citizenship through the existing process, which can take a decade or longer. In contrast, Democrats say, their plan would naturalize people as citizens far sooner. Rubio's Evolution On The Issue Rubio's move is a departure from the hard line on illegal immigration he took while running for the Senate in 2010, angering many Hispanic groups who had hoped he would help push Republicans toward a pro-citizenship stance. Rubio, 40, the son of Cuban immigrants, ran as a Tea Party favorite and avowed conservative. Since then, he has softened his position, having publicly urged fellow Republicans to tone down their hostile rhetoric about illegal immigrants before weighing in with his proposal. With his considerable political talents, and hailing from an important presidential battleground state, Rubio has emerged as his party's most prominent Latino. Hispanics' rapid population growth will give them a pivotal role in the 2012 elections, particularly in some battleground states. As a vice presidential candidate, or perhaps in some other prominent role in the Romney campaign, Rubio could help the Republican Party siphon Hispanic votes from the Democrats. The political crosscurrents at play are dizzying. People on all sides of the immigration debate are closely watching Rubio assume the forbidding task of carefully crafting a proposal that meets several objectives: help repair the GOP brand among Hispanics; appeal to non-Hispanic independent voters who favor a path to citizenship; and upend President Obama and the Democrats' advantage on the issue, all without angering conservatives. Here's a sampling of the wide range of opinions about Rubio's version of the Dream Act. This story continues below the graphic. Source: NPR Credit: Julia Ro Obama seemed to derisively allude to the Rubio plan in a recent interview with the Spanish-language network Telemundo: \"This notion that somehow Republicans want to have it both ways \u2014 they want to vote against these laws and appeal to anti-immigrant sentiment ... and then they come and say, 'But we really care about these kids and we want to do something about it' \u2014 that looks like hypocrisy to me.\" He's not the only presidential candidate who might feel pressure. Romney himself must consider whether to embrace Rubio's proposal and risk being lambasted again by conservatives and the Obama campaign as a flip-flopper. The last Republican presidential nominee, Arizona Sen. John McCain, lost to Barack Obama in part because he was unable to energize conservatives, who hadn't forgiven him for the McCain-Kennedy immigration bill, which would have set a path to citizenship. So far, reactions to the Rubio proposal have been mixed, even unexpected. For instance, some immigrant advocates who usually side with the Democrats on the issue have enthusiastically gotten behind Rubio, even though his plan appears to fall short of the original Dream Act. Their decision was made easier by their frustrations over Obama's failure to get the original act through Congress, as well as the record number of deportations processed by his administration.",

Mitt Romney speaks at a campaign rally in Tempe, Ariz., on Friday.\n                \n                    \n                    Jae C. Hong/AP\n                    \n                \nhide caption At a Republican candidates' forum in Wisconsin before the state's primary earlier this month, a speaker who wasn't on the ballot had strong words for the GOP regarding its low standing among Hispanic voters. \"The way the party ... talks about immigration is going to impact the future course of this party and the future course of this nation,\" said former U.S. Attorney General Alberto Gonzales, the first Hispanic to hold the nation's highest law enforcement post. Gonzales didn't mention any candidate by name, but during the Republican primaries, none staked out a tougher position on immigration than former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney. \"Of course we build a fence, and of course we do not give in-state tuition credits to people who come here illegally,\" Romney said at a debate in Tampa last year. \"That only attracts people to come here and take advantage of America's great beneficence.\" In another debate, Romney touted his 2006 agreement with the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency to allow Massachusetts State Police troopers to enforce immigration laws to, as he put it, \"make sure those people who we arrest are put in jail, to find out they're here illegally, we're going to get them out of here.\" It might be a position designed to win votes in Republican primaries, but it hurts the party in the long run, Gonzales said in an interview with NPR. \"Anything you say, any campaign position you take, there are going to be consequences,\" he said. \"I think given the current trajectory, if there's not a change in course, the consequences are not going to be good ones for a Romney presidency, at least with respect to Hispanic votes.\" The GOP Message In recent days, there have been hints of a change of course. The Republican National Committee announced an expanded outreach program targeting Hispanic voters in states with large Hispanic populations, like New Mexico, Colorado, Virginia and North Carolina. The RNC posted an online announcement about the effort, and prominent Hispanic Republicans in Congress, like Florida Sen. Marco Rubio, are speaking out. \"I am concerned, because there is this growing demographic in America who I think \u2014 at a minimum \u2014 we should be competitive in and we're not,\" Rubio said at a forum in Washington sponsored by the National Journal magazine. Rubio, a Cuban-American, is widely viewed as a potential running mate for Romney. \"I think what needs to happen is a permanent commitment that we are going to take the time and energy in the long term to make this argument about why limited government and free enterprise is the right answer to their desires [and] their aspirations,\" he said. Rubio is also trying, however, to soften his party's image on the issue of immigration by proposing an alternative to the White House-backed Dream Act. 'Stay The Course' But some of Romney's backers are urging him not to soften his stand on immigration. Kris Kobach, the secretary of state in Kansas and an aggressive proponent of strong immigration laws with strict enforcement, says Romney should \"stay the course\" on his immigration position. The way the Romney campaign has described Kobach \u2014 who helped write the controversial Arizona law, SB 1070, that goes before the U.S. Supreme Court this week \u2014 gives some clues as to how it is wrestling with immigration. Early on, Kobach was an \"adviser\"; more recently, he was just a \"supporter,\" according to the campaign, and now he's called an \"informal adviser.\" Citing a recent survey from Quinnipiac, Kobach says that among independent voters, 48 percent favor Romney's position on immigration versus 33 percent who favor President Obama's position on immigration. \"Clearly he's winning with Independent voters by taking a law enforcement-oriented approach, and independent voters will decide who becomes president in the fall,\" Kobach says. Whether Romney keeps his previous hard line on immigration now that his nomination seems assured remains to be seen. On Monday, he campaigns with Rubio in Pennsylvania, but on Friday he did more listening than talking when he met with Hispanic business owners in Arizona. One thing does seem clear: Both he and the Republican Party want to shift the focus away from immigration, hoping to win votes with the argument that Obama's handling of the economy has been bad for the country and for Hispanics.",

            "article_content": "A note to the Republican presidential candidates heading to Washington for the Conservative Political Action Conference: Some of the events could make you uncomfortable if you're planning to tack to the center in your general election campaign. Three of the GOP candidates \u2014 Mitt Romney, Newt Gingrich and Rick Santorum \u2014 will address the largest annual gathering of conservatives on Friday. But Thursday brought a provocative panel discussion: \"The Failure of Multiculturalism: How the Pursuit of Diversity Is Weakening the American Identity.\" One of the panel's speakers was conservative author Peter Brimelow, whose book, Alien Nation, decried America's increasing racial diversity due to immigration (legal or illegal). The Southern Poverty Law Center has identified him as a \"white nationalist\" and monitors his website, VDARE.com, as a hate group. (Brimelow, an immigrant from England, named his website after Virginia Dare, the first English settler born in the New World, in 1587.) Brimelow was joined on the panel by Robert Vandervoort, whose organization, ProEnglish, sponsored the discussion. ProEnglish advocates making English the official language of the government. Vandervoot also is scheduled to speak on a Saturday panel, \"High Fences, Wide Gates: States vs. the Feds, the Rule of Law & American Identity.\" As one would guess, this is about illegal immigration. The headliner on the dais will be Kansas Secretary of State Kris Kobach, the architect of the state laws cracking down on illegal immigration \u2014 legislation that has driven a wedge between Latinos and the Republican Party. Kobach advises Romney on immigration policy, which helps explain Romney's pledge to, if elected, veto the DREAM Act, which would set a path to legal status for people under age 36 who arrived illegally in the U.S. as children. Also on the panel are two Latino Republican congressmen, Reps. Mario Diaz-Balart and David Rivera, who stand at the opposite end of the spectrum on immigration. Diaz-Balart and Rivera are Cuban-Americans from Florida and support the DREAM Act. Diaz-Balart has taken criticism for overlooking Romney's immigration position to become one of his key supporters in the battleground state. Rivera supports Newt Gingrich, who has taken a more moderate stance on immigration.",

Mitt Romney's decisive win over former House Speaker Newt Gingrich in Florida returned him to the front-runner's spot in the Republican presidential race. Romney emerged from that battle with his strengths, but also his weaknesses, on full display. Sometimes hard-fought nominating contests produce a more formidable general-election candidate. That's what happened to Barack Obama in 2008. But Dan Schnur, a former Republican strategist, says it's too soon to tell whether this Republican primary battle will have the same effect. It's an open question at this point whether an ongoing Romney-Gingrich fight strengthens the eventual nominee or draws him further from the political center and makes it that much more difficult to run a competitive general-election campaign in the fall. Dan Schnur, former Republican strategist \"It's an open question at this point whether an ongoing Romney-Gingrich fight strengthens the eventual nominee or draws him further from the political center and makes it that much more difficult to run a competitive general-election campaign in the fall,\" Schnur says. 'Damage Has Already Been Done' Romney has been careful not to move too far to the right on most issues \u2014 with one glaring exception: immigration. Romney won big majorities of Republican Hispanics in Florida, but they were mostly Cuban and Puerto Rican. Alfonso Aguilar of the Latino Partnership for Conservative Principles says Romney hurt his ability to appeal to Hispanic voters elsewhere with his opposition to the Dream Act and for suggesting all illegal immigrants self-deport. \"There are many Latinos who would consider voting for a Republican, for a conservative candidate, but who don't see those sorts of statements ... as something positive,\" Aguilar says. \"I must say that if he is the nominee, damage has already been done ... and he has to realize that. ... And I frankly don't know what he's been thinking.\" Democrats Pounce Aguilar's reaction is exactly what Democrats want to encourage among Hispanic voters. A Democratic superPAC is airing a Spanish-language radio ad in Nevada that says, \"Mitt Romney has no shame. He shows one face to the Hispanic community and another completely different one to everyone else.\" That's not the only way Democrats plan to take advantage of the vulnerabilities Romney has exposed on the campaign trail. Bill Burton, who runs a pro-Obama superPAC, says Romney's unforced errors have given him a shelf full of material. \"I would say No. 1 is the various times he jokes about firing people. No. 2 would have to be the various times he jokes about the economy or being unemployed,\" Burton says, as well as \"his clearly not understanding the kind of anxiety that middle-class Americans are feeling.\" When you see this type of scorched-earth campaigning, you're really worried if your focus is beating President Obama. Steve Schmidt, McCain strategist in 2008 Romney, known as a superdisciplined candidate, has made an awful lot of  unforced errors \u2014 from this week's comment that he's not concerned about the very poor, to his awkward handling of his Swiss bank accounts, beachfront home and blind trusts. Too Much Negativity? Some Republicans worry less about Romney's wealth and gaffes than about the overwhelming negative turn in the Republican race. In Florida, Romney and his allies spent $15 million on ads. Only one was positive \u2014 a Spanish-language radio ad that aired just 15 times. The rest were attack ads eviscerating Gingrich. \"When you see this type of scorched-earth campaigning,\" says Steve Schmidt, who was John McCain's top strategist in 2008, \"you're really worried if your focus is beating President Obama \u2014 because you worry about the unfavorable numbers being risen to high levels among independent voters across the country.\" In the most recent ABC-Washington Post poll, Romney's favorable ratings with swing voters dropped 18 points, from 41 percent to just 23 percent. And there are signs that the enthusiasm of the Republican base might not be as strong as it was in 2010: Turnout among Republicans has been down in every contest this year. That's what worries Matt Kibbe of FreedomWorks, the Tea Party resource center in Washington. \"For all of the circling the wagons around Mitt Romney, there's a lot of concern behind the scenes, even among Republican establishment types, that he's not a terribly strong candidate,\" Kibbe says. \"It's not as if people don't know who Mitt Romney is in Republican primary circles. So there's something wrong there.\" Preparing For The Fall For all of Romney's weaknesses, he also has formidable advantages. The Republican Party, the Romney campaign and its superPAC allies appear poised to raise more money than the president and his supporters. The political landscape this year favors a challenger: Obama is a vulnerable incumbent with approval ratings of less than 50 percent.  Unemployment is expected to stay higher than 8 percent through Election Day, and in the past few weeks, Romney has become a more aggressive candidate and a much better debater. \"This strongly contested Republican primary has one significant benefit for Mitt Romney,\" Schnur says. \"Going through this type of fire in the spring will make him a better and more well-prepared candidate for the fall.\" By one measure, Romney looks like he's in very good shape for the fall campaign. In national and swing state polls, Romney and Obama are tied.",

Ebenhack/AP\n                    \n                \nhide caption Newt Gingrich autographs a copy of his book in Orlando, Fla., Jan. 13. (Updated at 7:46 pm ET) With Newt Gingrich beating Mitt Romney in South Carolina as soundly as the Johnny Rebels in 1861 thrashed the Billy Yanks at Bull Run (or the First Battle of Manassas, depending on your view), the Republican presidential nomination contest marches southward to Florida. There in the Sunshine State, the campaign promises to be an even more hard- fought affair than in South Carolina, with both candidates battling for their party's conservative soul by out-righting each other. Of course, the further right you go as a Republican presidential candidate, the more ground you have to cover to get closer to the center for the general election to win over enough voters in the non-conservative part of the electorate. But first you have to become the Republican nominee to have the luxury of such worries, and that's what Gingrich and Romney are all about right now, becoming the eventual GOP standard bearer. The general election can wait. Gingrich, in a play for conservatives everywhere, credited South Carolinians for for first discovering what he hopes Floridians will soon learn as well. On CBS' Face The Nation, he said: \"South Carolinians were the first state to really  understand how liberal Gov. Romney's record was as the governor of  Massachusetts. He lost 15 to 20 points over the course of the two weeks  as people began to realize that he has been pro-choice, pro-gun control,  pro-tax increase, in a whole range of areas. That despite his  advertising and pretending, it's clear that he was way to the left of  South Carolinians.\" That's a message Gingrich is sure to pound away on for the next 10 days in Florida. Meanwhile Romney promised to do some educating about Gingrich going forward. On Fox News Sunday he said: \"I do think that conservative values do play an enormous role and I think the speaker has some explaining to do for sitting down on the sofa with Nancy Pelosi and arguing for climate change regulation, for calling the Paul Ryan plan right wing social engineering. \"You're going to look at his record and say, well, he is not so conservative, as a reliable conservative leader, as people might have imagined.\" South Carolina exit polls tell the tale of the importance of appealing to conservative voters in Southern primaries. Sixty-eight percent of those who voted Saturday described themselves as conservative. Large swaths of Florida are more similar to South Carolina than different. Exit polling done on the day of the 2008 Florida presidential primary found 61 percent of voters there describing themselves as conservative. A candidate hoping to win those conservatives has to convincingly deliver a message that fires up those voters. That's why Gingrich made sure to remind everyone Sunday that as Massachusetts governor in the mid-2000s, Romney governed as a moderate on abortion, guns and taxes. (Gingrich forcefully laid out his case against Romney's conservative credentials on Face The Nation starting at about the 4:35 mark in the video.) But Gingrich and Romney will have to carefully calibrate their message, according to Susan MacManus, a political science professor at the University of South Florida. Fiscal conservatism is a safer path in Florida than social conservatism. \"Social conservatives are not a dominant part of this electorate,\" McManus said in an interview. Also, Florida Republicans are more environmentally minded, McManus said.  \"Florida Republicans are a bit more environmentally sensitive than Republicans in a lot of other places. Typically because many of them moved from other places because of our environmental assets,\" she said. So attacking the Environmental Protection Agency or calling for more offshore energy exploration and production aren't necessarily sure-fire applause lines with every audience of Florida Republicans as they might be elsewhere. No less than Republican heavyweight political strategist Karl Rove has warned his party repeatedly against moving so far right in the primaries that it damages its eventual nominee's chances to defeat President Barack Obama in the general election. In August, Rove warned during a Fox News appearance: \"You don't want these candidates moving so right in the Republican primary that it becomes impossible for them to win the general election, because it will become a self-defeating message in the primary. \"People want to win. They don't want somebody who goes so far to the extremes of either party that they lack a chance to carry a victory off in November.\" Paul Begala, a political aide to President Bill Clinton frequent Democratic commentator on CNN and elsewhere, recently wrote in the Daily Beast how this need, as demonstrated by Gingrich and  Romney, to appeal to a party whose base has moved even further rightward  could explain why some top GOP prospects decided not to make the 2012  race. \"My suspicion is, the reason the cream of the  GOP crop is sitting out 2012 is not because they're worried they can't  beat Obama straight up. It's because they're worried that their base is  so crazy they'll be dragged so far to the right in the primaries that  Obama will capture the center in the general election and make it  impossible for them to win... \"... The price of winning the votes  of the new, ultra-right GOP may make the party's presidential nomination  a prize not worth winning.\" But that hasn't stopped them. Gingrich continues his rhetorical attacks on federal judges with whom he disagrees, including one in his South Carolina victory speech. That may appeal to the conservative faithful but is likely to turn off more centrist voters. Meanwhile, Romney has taken a position to the right of Gingrich on immigration. Unlike Gingrich, who has advanced the idea of illegal immigrants with deep ties to their U.S. communities being given legal status to remain in the U.S., Romney opposes that idea and has promised to veto the DREAM Act if Congress were to pass the measure and he were in the Oval Office. Like Gingrich on judges, Romney's hard-line stance on young immigrants who had no choice when their parents brought them illegally into the U.S. is unlikely a winner in a general election campaign. Immigration is an issue that will cut far differently in Florida than it did in South Carolina, said McManus. \"It doesn't work real well for anybody down here because you've got, really, four different perspectives on it down here that will probably the trickiest issue they have to cover,\" she said. Many older Floridians and those in the military have viewed immigration as a potential national-security threat ever since 9/11 because some of the hijackers received flight training in the state, McManus said. Working class Floridians, meanwhile, view immigration as a competitive threat in a state with higher than average unemployment rate, she added. Republican businesspeople in agriculture and tourism, however, have a positive view, seeing immigration as their lifeblood. They are related by outlook to Florida Republicans like Jeb Bush, the former governor, she said. Those Republicans understand the importance of Latino voters to the GOP's future and the state's economy. \"It just is an issue, no matter which way they go, they're going to offend a certain part of the base and also a certain part of the overall electorate beyond just the party,\" McManus said.",

It seems Former Massachusetts  Gov. Mitt Romney may at last be melting enough hearts to secure his front-runner status \u2014 for the moment, anyway. The Des Moines Register's  final poll before Tuesday's Iowa caucuses put Romney ahead in what looks to be a three-man race. The poll, released Saturday night, showed Romney in the lead at 24 percent. Congressman Ron Paul was a very  close second at 22 percent, and a surprise surge put Sen. Rick Santorum  third at 15 percent. Yet even with his challengers close on his heels, Romney's focus was elsewhere on Saturday. Stopping in Le Mars, Iowa \u2014 the self-proclaimed \"Ice Cream Capital of the World\" \u2014 his speech, like all Romney campaign speeches, was about President Obama. \"This is an election to decide whether we're going to go further and further down the path of becoming more and more similar to a European welfare state, or whether instead we're going to remain an exceptional nation,\" he told the audience at the Family Table Restaurant. There was also a nod to Ronald Reagan-style eloquence. \"I don't want to do what the president said, 'fundamentally transform America.' I don't want to turn us into something we're not,\" Romney said. \"I want to bring back the principles that made us the hope of the earth. We are still a shining city on a hill.\" Romney did make some news at the restaurant regarding the DREAM Act, a bill that would create a path to citizenship for children of illegal immigrants. An audience member asked if he would veto the bill if Congress passed it. The candidate said he would. Romney went on to detail his plan to reduce illegal immigration. \"Secure the border with a fence, make sure we have enough border patrol agents to secure the fence, and I will also crack down on employers that hire people who are here illegally,\" he said. The latest poll by The Des Moines Register puts Romney in the lead in Iowa with 24 percent, just ahead of Congressman Ron Paul, who has 22 percent. Still, many Iowa Republicans still have misgivings about Romney. They don't like the health care law he signed as governor. There are suspicions about his social conservative credentials and about his Mormon faith. None of these came up Saturday. The audience, which included still undecided voters, was friendly. Le Mars Mayor Dick Kirchoff was at the restaurant. He has not endorsed a candidate, but says Romney is \"a very honest individual.\" \"To me, he's got a plan on how to turn things around, and that's important in my world,\" Kirchoff says. Retired engineer Bud Withrow, 76, says he's a reluctant Romney supporter. It's more a product of his dissatisfaction with the rest of the field. \"I'll go ahead and sign up, take my paper to vote, and I will vote for Mitt Romney,\" he says, \"but I feel uneasy about it.\"",

Raul Labrador (R-ID), speaks at the Conservative Political Action conference in February. One of the big questions that arose out of the November general election is how Republicans would pivot to close the astonishing gap in the Latino vote. Hispanics voted for President Obama instead of Gov. Mitt Romney by a 71-to-27 percent margin. That kind of lopsided result immeditately changed the minds of many Republicans on immigration reform. Today, Republicans in the House made their first legislative overture to the community when they passed the STEM Jobs Act, a bill that ditches a program that issues 55,000 permanent residency visas by lottery, but automatically hands a permanent visa to immigrants working toward an advanced degree in science, technology, engineering and mathematics. NPR's Renee Montagne spoke to Rep. Raul Labrador, a Republican from Idaho, and one of the supporters of the bill. He said this bill is a step toward achieving comprehensive immigration reform. He said Democrats don't support the bill because \"Democrats don't want to solve the immigration problem.\" Labrador said this bill keeps productive immigrants in the country. Fox News Latino reports that while some Democrats joined in the 257 to 158 vote, most, including President Obama, oppose the measure because it gets rid of the Diversity Visa Program. Fox News explains: \"About half of those visas go to Africa nations. Democrats said this \"zero sum game\" on the number of visas granted was unacceptable. \"'It pains me greatly that I cannot support this bill,' said Democratic Rep. Zoe Lofgren, whose northern California district includes many high-tech companies that for years have pushed for STEM visas so that they can hire the highly trained foreign scientists and engineers who now are forced to leave the country and find jobs with U.S. competitors. \"She said the bill would eventually result in fewer visas issued because far fewer than 50,000 degrees are given every year to foreigners in eligible STEM fields, and the bill does not allow unused visas to be transferred to other programs.\" Renee asked Labrador why start here, why not instead pass the DREAM Act, which would give younger illegal immigrants legal status. \"That should be the next thing we work on,\" he said, adding that he thinks immigration reform should be taken piece-by-piece instead of trying to pass a huge bill that nobody's happy with. Renee went on to ask Labrador about another sticking point: Republicans have insisted in their version of the DREAM Act and in other legislation that there be no path to citizenship. Renee asked why and she asked it was because Republicans thought if those immigrants become citizens they would go on to vote for Democrats. Labrador dismissed the notion. \"We don't believe that people who committed illegal acts should be rewarded with the greatest gift that we have \u2014 and that's citizenship,\" Labrador said. The STEM Jobs Act, by the way, will likely die here, because the Democratically-controlled Senate is unlikely to pick it up. Correction at 1:43 p.m. ET. An earlier version of this post misidentified Rep. Labrador as representing Iowa. He is a representative from Idaho.",

At first glance, it appears that they just might. After the election, in which more than 70 percent of Latinos voted for President Obama, House Speaker John Boehner, R-Ohio, said \"a comprehensive approach is long overdue\" and that Republican House leaders and Obama \"can find the common ground.\" Speaker of the House John Boehner, R-Ohio, speaks during a news conference in the Capitol on Nov. 9.

Boehner has said Republican House leaders and Obama \"can find the common ground\" on immigration policy. On Nov. 16, Florida Rep. Mario Diaz-Balart announced that he and fellow Hispanic Republican lawmakers had begun meeting with Democrats to \"find a bipartisan solution.\" Democratic Rep. Luis Gutierrez of Illinois, who has aggressively pushed for immigration reform, even when his fellow Democrats were silent, couldn't be happier. \"Finally, thank God,\" Gutierrez says. \"On a serious note, I've met with a dozen of my colleagues on the Republican side, and they have all said, 'We've got to get this done.' This election proved that people won't accept doing nothing. And they won't accept finger-pointing.\" Blueprint For Bipartisan Talks? This coming week, the Congressional Hispanic Caucus, which consists largely of Democrats, is expected to release a set of \"principles\" that they hope will guide bipartisan talks when the new Congress begins in January. Obama also has urged lawmakers to \"seize the moment\" early next year. The Hispanic caucus's parameters will include the bedrock goals of Democrats and immigrant advocates, such as a path to legal status if not outright citizenship, and requirements such as learning English and paying back taxes. Also included will be conservative priorities such as securing U.S. borders and worker verification. Gutierrez, who is a member of the caucus, says now is the time \"to let the process work amongst our Democratic and Republican members. Will they come to some kind of flowering? I think so.\" So far, the new esprit de corps hasn't spread to Republicans on the House immigration subcommittee, which could act as the conservative firewall against new legislation. The committee is packed with members who support limited immigration and oppose legal status for illegal immigrants. The retirement of subcommittee chairman Elton Gallegly, R-Calif., at the end of the year could lead to the elevation of vice chairman Steve King, R-Iowa. King has been an archenemy of immigrant advocates and last year introduced a bill to eliminate automatic citizenship for children born in the United States to illegal immigrants. In recent days, Boehner has backed off the idea, preferred by Democrats, of a single immigration bill and suggested that revisions could be divided into several smaller measures. That approach is favored by conservatives, whose support Boehner must have for any deal. \"There's a lot of distrust on both sides of this debate, and I think a lot of distrust in the American electorate on this debate,\" says Matthew Spalding, vice president of American Studies at the Heritage Foundation, a conservative think tank. \"The potential problem is if this immediately becomes framed as the same pre-existing alternatives, like, 'Let's do everything in one big piece of legislation,' which is complicated, expensive and hard to do, I'm not sure trying it for a third time would work.\" Spalding says the bills could separately target issues such as border security, problems in the immigration system, such as visa backlogs, and the status of people already in the United States. Testing The Waters The first test could come with the introduction of a Republican immigration bill during the current lame-duck session of Congress. The STEM Jobs Act would increase the number of green cards for foreign-born graduates in the United States with doctorates in science, technology, engineering and mathematics. The bill failed to pass the House in September, despite 30 Democrats having voted for it. There's a lot of distrust on both sides of this debate, and I think a lot of distrust in the American electorate on this debate. Matthew Spalding, vice president of American Studies at the Heritage Foundation But it's not the olive branch many Democrats want. Its author, conservative Rep. Lamar Smith (R-Texas), has been a staunch opponent of immigrant advocates, favoring a limited flow of foreigners and opposing a path to citizenship for those already in the United States. In an editorial letter published by Politico on Tuesday, Smith criticized as flawed a recent ABC News/Washington Post poll in which 57 percent of all respondents said they support a path to citizenship. Smith wrote that the results merely support \"the media's predetermined notions.\" Smith cited Rasmussen Reports polls from 2011 in which majorities of respondents favored securing U.S. borders over granting legal status \u2014 or amnesty, as Smith put it \u2014 to illegal immigrants. Democrats oppose Smith's bill because they say it wouldn't significantly relieve the backlog of more than 400,000 high-skilled immigrants awaiting permanent green cards and would take 55,000 green cards per year from the diversity visa category, eliminating that program. Diversity green cards are issued to people from African nations and other countries with low rates of emigration to the United States. Democratic Rep. Zoe Lofgren of California has proposed a similar bill that instead would add new green cards for high-skilled workers while preserving the diversity visa program. Some Democrats, preferring not to poison the potential for a bipartisan compromise, quietly bristle at the possibility that Republicans could bring Smith's bill to the House floor for a vote by using a \"closed\" rule, which would prevent Democrats from attaching amendments. In Senate, Dueling Versions Of DREAM Act In the Democratic-controlled Senate, members in both parties already have pledged action on immigration. Sens. Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., who is expected to return as chairman of the chamber's immigration subcommittee, and Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., want to revive their 2010 wide-ranging proposal that would include a guest-worker program, automatic visas for foreign-born graduates with advance degrees in high-tech fields, and legal status for those with no criminal records who pay a fine. Several Republican senators, such as Marco Rubio and Susan Collins, want to pass an updated DREAM Act, which would offer a path to citizenship for young adults brought to the United States as children. The original bill, drafted by Democrats, failed in the Senate in 2010. Collins, of Maine, was among the Republicans who defeated the DREAM Act in 2010. Rubio, of Florida, who is Cuban-American, has been working on his own version but hasn't released details. Republican Sens. Kay Bailey Hutchison of Texas and Jon Kyl of Arizona, who are retiring at the end of this year, have proposed a pared-down version of the DREAM Act, called the ACHIEVE Act, which would offer legal status but not citizenship. Immigrant activist Cesar Vargas, director of the DREAM Action Coalition, said in a recent blog post in The Hill, that the ACHIEVE Act would be \"untenable\" for young people. \"The American people certainly appreciate the proactive efforts of the Republican leadership for beginning to engage in the conversation of immigration,\" Vargas said in the post. \"However, voters, specifically Latino voters, spoke clearly on election day that they support the original DREAM Act. Mitt Romney garnered only 27 percent of the Latino vote, primarily due to his threat to veto the DREAM Act.\" Obama's deferred deportation program targets DREAM Act-eligible people, though Rubio and most other Republicans have criticized the effort as a politically opportunistic quick fix. Since the program began in August, more than 309,000 people have applied and more than 53,000 have been approved for the two-year reprieve, according to the latest government figures.",

Obama hit the campaign trail this week, shadowed by a week of fateful events at home and abroad weighing heavily on his hopes of re-election. Read Another Opinion On Obama's Reelection Plan Frank Cannon and Jeffrey Bell are president and policy director of the American Principles Project, a Washington-based advocacy group. If you're wondering how President Obama plans to get re-elected in 2012 \u2014 and why he might succeed \u2014 look back not to 2008 but to his successful campaign to win congressional passage of Obamacare during 2009 and early 2010. Obamacare generated popular doubts from the beginning, and fairly early in the congressional debate voters arrived at a net-negative view. This never changed to this day, more than two years after final approval of the legislation in March 2010. Yet Team Obama devised and executed a plan that resulted in a historic victory that had eluded earlier Democratic presidents. It's often assumed that this was achieved by simple fact of the overwhelmingly Democratic makeup of the 111th Congress elected with Barack Obama in 2008. While it is true this predominance turned out to be a precondition of victory, the politically explosive rise of the Tea Party beginning in early 2009 and skepticism even from some Democratic-leaning constituencies made passage of Obamacare far from inevitable. Team Obama learned early on that the president's many speeches on the subject would have zero impact on voters' view of his plan. Instead the administration focused on mobilizing the left power base (labor, the social left, AARP, and Hollywood) and moving through special interests (hospitals, insurance companies, Fortune 500) to assemble, piece by piece, an economic and lobbying juggernaut. Conservative and Republican elites responded, for the most part, with a defense of free markets and a knowledgeable critique of top-down, government-imposed medicine. This was a strategy that had been successful in the resistance to Hillarycare in 1993-94, and on many levels it won the public debate of 2009-10. But in retrospect it proved one-dimensional in comparison with what the administration was bringing to bear. The essence of the Obama strategy was an odd combination of moral lecturing and raw power \u2014 Harvard married to the Chicago Way. Social conservatives and grassroots Tea Party types attempted to attack Obamacare on the moral plane \u2014 warning about death panels, universal abortion coverage, violation of the Constitution, etc. \u2014 but the Washington-based conservative leadership that set the tone and controlled most of the opposition spending preferred to steer away from such arguments and toward explanations of why Obamacare would make health care worse in practice for most if not all Americans. In the end this wasn't enough. Now a souped-up Obamacare strategy has taken center stage in the president's campaign for re-election. Fundraising problems? Move up the timetable for endorsement of same-sex marriage. Buyer's remorse among pro-immigration Latino voters? Steal the bipartisan DREAM Act compromise being developed by Florida senator Marco Rubio and issue it as a temporary enforcement guideline from the Department of Homeland Security. The other half of the parallel to Obamacare is a decision to stop arguing \u2014 or at least stop agonizing \u2014 about the big picture. In Obamacare, the big picture \u2014 the elephant in the room \u2014 was the overall unpopularity of Obama-care. At a certain point, Team Obama realized that by negotiating deals and understandings with powerful constituencies, they could overcome the unpopularity of the bill. Today, of course, the elephant in the room is the mediocre economy. Obama's allusion to the private sector doing \"fine\" \u2014 and his quick retraction of it \u2014 was the last time in the campaign we're likely to hear any disagreement about the state of the national economy. From now until November 6, Democrats and Republicans will be in agreement about what the electorate already knows: The economy is badly underperforming. What we haven't heard the last of is the blame game. After three-and-a-half Obama years, blaming George W. Bush for the financial crisis, the 2007-09 recession, and the subsequent stagnation infuriates Republican elites (particularly Bush alumni). But as a line of attack, it is far more in accord with the views of American voters than the (now abandoned) contention that under Obama the national economy has made a decent comeback. In Gallup's most recent sounding on this issue, taken in early June, 68 percent of voters blame George W. Bush a \"great deal\" or a \"moderate amount\" for the nation's economic problems, while 52 percent assign such blame to Obama. Perhaps counter-intuitively, voters' blaming of Bush has not faded with time and distance from the Bush presidency. The percentage blaming Bush for economic conditions did drop from around 80 percent to 70 percent between the summer of 2009 and the summer of 2010, but it has remained stable in the nearly two years since then. Even 49 percent of Republicans blame Bush, with 51 percent saying he isn't to blame. Obama's considerably lower \"blame\" numbers have also remained steady, ranging from 48 to 53 percent in Gallup polls taken since 2010. Thematically, these numbers dictate for Team Obama repeated accusations that Mitt Romney yearns to return to the George W. Bush policies that got America in economic trouble in the first place. In particular, Obama strategists would treat Romney's selection as a vice presidential running mate of anyone who could be portrayed as a Bush-era economic policymaker (such as Ohio senator Rob Portman) as a gift from the political gods. Even if Romney avoids this trap, it behooves him to emphasize elements of his economic plan that can be depicted as departures from the Bush era. Now that both sides of the debate accept as fact the mediocre performance of the economy, it is no longer in Romney's interest to focus so much of his campaigning on lamenting economic weakness in the present. For one thing, it limits his ability to exploit Obama's vulnerabilities in noneconomic areas. Regarding (and at times labeling) all noneconomic issues as \"distractions\" leaves an open field for Team Obama's slicing and dicing of the electorate into recipients of narrow but attractive noneconomic messages. For another, it devalues a future-oriented economic debate that is more in Romney's interest than Obama's. Rather than falling into a backward-looking blame game that in major respects favors Obama rather than the GOP, Romney needs to contrast his plans for budget and tax reform to Obama's desire for a stiff increase in tax rates to finance continued high levels of domestic spending. After all, Obama got into political trouble in 2009-10 not for having created the economic crisis, but for Obamacare, the stimulus, and other federal spending schemes that rang false to millions of Americans as a credible pathway out of the crisis. Obama's addiction to this kind of solution has not changed, and will be back in play if he gets a second term. Finally, within the overall bleakness of the national economy there are regional disparities that go against the grain of Romney's message and Electoral College targeting. Most salient is the fact that the politically pivotal Midwest suffered less during the recession \u2014 it had far less of a housing bubble than any other region \u2014 and is currently doing considerably better than the national average thanks to such factors as the boom in agricultural commodities, a mild recovery in industrial production, and the revolution in domestic energy production that centers on hydraulic fracturing (\"fracking\"). First-term Republican governors in Iowa, Wisconsin, and Ohio are taking bows for unemployment rates well below the national average. So is the governor of Pennsylvania, a fracking state that outside the Philadelphia region is much more like the Midwest than the Northeast. Even Michigan, an economic basket case before the 2007 recession, has seen its unemployment rate decline to just above the national average. It is perhaps no coincidence that the one Southern state where polling still shows a consistent Obama edge is Virginia, which (with its proximity to Washington) dodged much of the residential housing holocaust and has by far the lowest unemployment rate (5.6 percent) of any state in the South. Among the 12 states listed as too close to call by RealClearPolitics, only 2 \u2014 Nevada and North Carolina \u2014 today have unemployment rates significantly above the national average. Heading into the summer, Obama's re-election strategy has taken shape. It has proven itself capable of success and should not be underestimated. Mitt Romney's job is to avoid falling into its traps and make the adjustments needed to counter it.",

Two years later, he failed to win a second term.\n                \n                    \n                    Bao Nguyen/Walking Iris Films\n                    \n                \nhide caption In 2008, Republican Anh \"Joseph\" Cao was elected to Louisiana's predominantly black and Democratic 2nd Congressional District, which includes New Orleans, making him the first Vietnamese-American member of Congress. Needless to say, it was an unlikely rise. Cao's victory came on the heels of a bribery scandal involving then-incumbent Democratic Rep. William Jefferson. \"They found $90,000 in cash in [Jefferson's] freezer, in pie tins and boxes,\" filmmaker Leo Chiang tells NPR's Guy Raz. \"It was basically the biggest scandal in congressional history.\" That scandal helped set the stage for Cao's ascent, which Chiang documents in his film Mr. Cao Goes to Washington, showing at film festivals this summer and airing on PBS in November. Chiang explains that despite the scandal, Jefferson ran again in 2008. With the district's Democratic leanings, his re-election initially seemed like a foregone conclusion. \"And here comes this little 5-foot-2 Vietnamese-American, Joseph Cao, who is a Republican, and he decides that he was going to run for Congress,\" Chiang says. \"Doesn't matter that nobody [knew] who he was.\" A first-generation Vietnamese immigrant and a lawyer by trade, Cao ultimately unseated Jefferson, taking the 2nd District on a platform of change. Chiang says, \"He was selling himself ... as a change agent \u2014 much like President Obama was doing \u2014 to this district that has been long plagued by corruption and lots of dirty politics.\" Breaking Ranks In Chiang's film, Cao comes across as a genuinely nice, almost naive person. At one event, he tells a constituent that \"political affiliations [are] only for convenience\" and \"nothing else.\" Chiang attributes Cao's idealistic convictions to his background as a seminarian \u2014 he studied to be a priest before eventually becoming a lawyer. \"He really believed that the American government should be bipartisan,\" Chiang says, \"should be full of compromises, should be able to do service for the people, and he \u2014 little Joseph Cao \u2014 was going to come and make that happen.\" Documentary filmmaker Leo Chiang was born and raised in Taiwan and moved to the U.S. as a teenager.\n                \n                    \n                    Andy Levin/Walking Iris Films\n                    \n                \nhide caption Documentary filmmaker Leo Chiang was born and raised in Taiwan and moved to the U.S. as a teenager. And a few months after arriving in Washington, Cao drew national attention for pursuing those convictions. He was the only Republican to support the health care legislation introduced by House Democrats in 2009, for which he was sharply criticized by Republican leadership. But he broke ranks, Chiang says, \"because he really believed that his district needed it. It is one of the poorest districts in the country, and four short years prior to that vote, Hurricane Katrina devastated that district.\" It was a matter of principle. Chiang posits that some might argue it was also an extremely smart political calculation on Cao's part \u2014 voting in favor of Democratic legislation and siding with President Obama made sense for a Republican congressman in a Democratic-dominated district. But once the bill made its way through the Senate and back to the House, Cao withdrew his support. \"From [Cao's] point of view, there was not ... sufficient language that prevents federal funding of abortion,\" Chiang says. A Matter Of Personal Principle Despite his many seemingly liberal positions \u2014 opposition to \"don't ask, don't tell,\" support for immigration reform and the DREAM Act \u2014 Cao's stance on abortion was more traditionally conservative and in line with his seminarian background. \"My theory is that, as a young man, religion was something that gave him comfort,\" Chiang says, \"He really believed in what the church says about abortion and it became his most important personal principle.\" Rep. Anh \"Joseph\" Cao meets with President Obama on June 25, 2009.

Anh \"Joseph\" Cao meets with President Obama on June 25, 2009. Cao was the only Republican to support the health care legislation introduced by House Democrats that year. But Cao's Democratic constituents felt betrayed. When the next election rolled around, his victory over Democratic rival Cedric Richmond seemed unlikely and Cao's re-election campaign took an unusual turn \u2014 he went negative. But the turn didn't suit him. Chiang says lambasting his opponent's legal history, which included a law license suspension for perjury and an arrest over a bar brawl, was \"a bit of a [desperate] measure\" for Cao. To top it all off, President Obama, whom Cao counted as a friend, was backing his opponent. \"There was not a whole lot that they could do if they kept pursuing this narrative of [Cao] being this man of principle that was going to be best for the district,\" Chiang says. Cao lost that race to Richmond, and his stint in Washington came to an end, but Chiang says in some ways this is just the first chapter of his subject's political story. Cao has been touring the country with a Vietnamese-American PAC, raising funds for Vietnamese-American candidates nationwide, and as \"the pioneer politician in the Vietnamese-American community,\" Chiang says, \"I don't think we've seen the last of Joseph Cao yet in the political world.\"",

The rally officially kicked off the president's 2012 campaign for reelection. Read Another Opinion About The Tenor Of The Presidential Campaign Fred Barnes is executive editor at The Weekly Standard. By the time he took office in 2009, President Obama had fashioned a reputation as an idealist committed to reforming the way business is done in Washington. But as president, he's allowed this reputation to fritter away. And what's left of it is now being destroyed by his harsh and misguided campaign for reelection. Obama has become his own worst political enemy. Even when his job approval first began to fade, his poll numbers for being well-liked personally remained high. Now those are fading too. He's on the road to defeat. In 2008, Obama ran a \"bring us together\" campaign. He presented himself as a political uniter eager to bridge differences between the parties. This year, he's unleashed an \"us versus them\" campaign, catering to Democratic interest groups and seeking to marginalize Republican challenger Mitt Romney as an unacceptable alternative as president. Neither of these tactics is new to politics. FDR ran a divisive campaign for reelection in 1936, uniting Democratic factions and tarring his opponents as \"economic royalists.\" In 1964, Democrats isolated Republican Barry Goldwater as a conservative outside the mainstream of American politics. Likewise in 1972, Republicans succeeded in branding Democrat George McGovern as unacceptably left-wing. Obama has pursued these tactics crudely. He's done little to disguise his preferential treatment of narrow (but sympathetic) slices of the electorate. He's been concentrating on special interests, not the national interest, and it shows. To appease environmentalists, he blocked the Keystone oil pipeline from Canada. For younger voters, he's proposed to keep the interest rate on student loans from doubling.Feminists got the contraception mandate. To appeal to Hispanic voters, he promoted the DREAM Act to give their children a path to permanent residency. African Americans? Obama intruded himself into the case of Trayvon Martin, whose shooting death touched off a protest led by Jesse Jackson and Al Sharpton. If he had a son, Obama said, he'd look like Martin. For gays, he declared his support for same-sex marriage. For organized labor, he stacked the National Labor Relations Board with union partisans. His blatant political favoritism has backfired. The pipeline, it turns out, has broad public support. The requirement that health insurers provide free contraceptives, with no conscience exemption, infuriated Catholics and evangelical Protestants. His endorsement of gay marriage was seen by two-thirds of Americans as politically motivated. To ostracize Romney, the Obama campaign wants to make him personally unacceptable as a possible president. This is different from the way Goldwater and McGovern were marginalized \u2014 and more risky. They were attacked for their ideology and policies. With Romney, it's the morality of his decisions as head of Bain Capital that's being questioned. Obama would have you believe Romney is a bad person. There's a reason for this. It would be difficult to stigmatize Romney as politically extreme. In a May survey by the GOP polling group Resurgent Republic, 58 percent of Americans regarded him as moderate or somewhat conservative. \"They view Mitt Romney the same way they view themselves,\" pollster Whit Ayres says. \"It's Obama they view as outside the mainstream.\" Romney, by the way, has responded more deftly to criticism of his business career by the Obama campaign than he did to similar attacks by opponents during the Republican primaries. Andrea Saul, his spokeswoman, said this after an Obama TV ad blamed Romney for closing a steel plant: Mitt Romney helped create more jobs in his private sector experience and more jobs as governor of Massachusetts than President Obama has for the entire nation. President Obama has many questions to answer as to why his administration used the stimulus to reward wealthy campaign donors with taxpayer money for bad ideas like Solyndra, but 23 million Americans are still struggling to find jobs. Romney didn't need a compelling response to an Obama television spot that alleged Romney would not have seized the opportunity to kill Osama bin Laden, unlike the president. This is absurd. How could the Obama team know this? In truth, any president probably would have jumped at the chance to execute bin Laden. I suspect most people think so. Obama's style of running for reelection has taken its toll. \"The Greek columns are now in ruins,\" says Steve Law, who heads American Crossroads, the Republican super-PAC. He was referring to the makeshift columns erected on the Denver stage where Obama delivered his acceptance speech in 2008. Obama's \"ham-handed\" campaign has wiped out his \"last shred of brand equity.\" He's descended to the lowest common denominator. He's a Washington pol. Yet Democrats continue to cite Obama's likability as a political strength. Indeed, it once was. But no more. In the recent bipartisan Battle-ground Poll, nearly one-quarter of voters said they like Obama personally but disapprove of his policies. But here's the rub: Sixty-eight percent of those voters said they won't vote for Obama, and another 20 percent said they'll \"consider\" someone else. Only 6 percent said they plan to vote for him. \"For the Democrats to focus on the likability factor at the current time, however, largely appears to be fool's gold,\" insists GOP pollsters Ed Goeas and Brian Nienaber. Obama has a bigger problem: the growing assessment he's simply incapable of reviving the nation. American Crossroads has conducted a series of focus groups with swing voters who backed Obama in 2008. Last fall, they reluctantly acknowledged he'd failed to solve the country's problems, though they didn't regard their vote for him as a mistake. This spring, they've begun to render a tougher verdict: Obama may not be up to the job. Law says these swing voters won't be attracted to Romney by negative attacks on the president. Instead, he must persuade them he can succeed where Obama hasn't. Obama's continued decline is not inevitable. As Ayres points out, presidents win a second term when their job approval trends upward in the months before the election. This was true for Ronald Reagan and Bill Clinton, and could be for Obama. But he'll need a far better campaign than we've seen so far \u2014 and a better presidency too. I'm not betting on it.",

Whichever side of the political fence you fall on, it's hard not to be impressed with this aspect of our government. If the Supreme Court says a new law doesn't jive with the constitution, out it goes. As an astrophysicist trained to think in timescales far longer than election cycles, last week's focus on the Supreme Court has me thinking. What if we applied the same idea to something far more important than even health care? What is we applied the construction as the high court to the long-term survival of civilization? What if we created a Supreme Court of the Future? As large as heath care looms in our imaginations now, will anyone really remember these debates 100, 1,000 or 10,000 years from now? Probably not. But if Miami and New York end up mostly submerged by rising oceans in 2210 you can bet decisions we didn't take now will be remembered. That is because some issues we're confronting today have consequences \u2013 severe consequences \u2013 on timescales far longer than a human life span. Resource depletion, climate change, energy systems and overpopulation: These issues will loom large for our children, their children, and their children's children's grandchildren (feel free to add as many iterations to this as you like.) In just a century or so we built a sprawling, globe spanning culture that eats through resources like a kid tears through presents on Christmas morning. Unfortunately our collective appetite is untethered to the reality of living on a finite planet that has its own ways of reacting to our detritus (extra CO2, clear-cut forests, a million plastic water bottles floating in the ocean). Our actions, as we've only recently come to learn, will echo in their consequences down through centuries, tens of centuries or even longer. The problem with this recognition, however, is we're just not hard-wired as a species to think on timescales that long. Nothing in our collective experience prepared us for planning with such long terms feedback. In the past, when our \"homes\" filled up with crap (literally) we just moved on. Barring the invention of the warp-drive (don't hold your breath) that option is now pretty much exhausted. Given that evolutionary baggage, waiting for politicians and the normal political process to provide a solution may be wishful thinking. Which brings me to my Supreme Court of the Future. The US Supreme Court works because we revere the Constitution and its principals. We rely on the court to keep new laws in line with those principles. Presidents appoint (hopefully) wise judges who serve for life, freed from urgencies of day-to-day politics. It's a great idea and you can imagine applying the same principle to our most valued of principles: The well being of Human Civilization. Imagine we agreed on the baselines requirements for a working planetary culture, a Future's Constitution. We need an atmosphere that's breathable; fresh water that is drinkable; a climate operating within certain bounds etc. For civilization to remain viable we need to maintain those requirements for centuries acknowledging the planet to be a wildly interconnected system of water, air, earth and biosphere. In These requirements \u2013 living at the intersection of our best science and our best values \u2013 would provide a framework evaluating civilizations choices. And who would decide among squabbling parties when those choices have long-term consequences? The Supreme Court of Future of course. Who else could? No before you accuse me of getting all John Lennon on you and being an idealistic dreamer, consider this. We already have a supreme court and it's worked pretty darn well for about 220 years. And since planet's finite surface area is a matter of geometry not politics, there's not much to argue there either. So recognizing we have to think on timescales longer than quarterly corporate reports or job growth reports or election cycles is...well ... hard to argue with. This question of the future stakes out neither a liberal nor a conservative position. Instead, recognizing that we have evolved that a reach with our technologies that extends for centuries is merely part of our growing up in the most astronomical of senses. We are coming of age now planetary speaking. Perhaps a Supreme Court of the Future can help us, finally, to put away childish things and act like the adults we have become.",

Senator-elect Jeff Flake, a Republican from Arizona, is expected to play a big part in any overhaul of immigration laws.  DAVID GREENE, HOST: This is MORNING EDITION from NPR News. I'm David Greene. This morning we're remembering the victims of the shooting in Newtown, Connecticut on Friday, and we'll continue our coverage in just a moment with a story of someone with close ties to the school. Right now, though, an issue that has become more of a priority since last months' presidential election. The nation's Hispanics voted overwhelmingly for President Obama and pushed immigration to near the top of the legislative agenda. SENATOR-ELECT JEFF FLAKE: Well, there's nothing like a big election loss to focus the mind. GREENE: That is Senator-elect Jeff Flake from Arizona. He's a Republican who's expected to play a big part in any immigration reform. Over the next few days, we're going to look closely at the issue of immigration. Today, we start with a story from NPR's Ted Robbins on how we got here and what might happen. TED ROBBINS, BYLINE: The last time the nation dealt with comprehensive immigration reform - 1986. Back then, President Ronald Reagan said he would strengthen border security, stop employers from hiring illegal immigrants and give amnesty to about two million people. PRESIDENT RONALD REAGAN: I believe in the idea of amnesty for those who have put down roots and who have lived here, even though sometime back they may have entered illegally. ROBBINS: The amnesty happened. But it took two decades to build-up border security. And relatively few employers were prosecuted. Crucially, the 1986 law also didn't provide enough visas for more people to enter legally for work. Dan Kowalski is editor of Bender's Immigration Bulletin. DAN KOWALSKI: So it legalized a bunch of people who were here without status, but it did nothing to prevent a future buildup of people who had no way to get a visa. ROBBINS: Millions more came illegally, mostly from Latin America. Today, an estimated 11 million are in the U.S. In 2005, a bipartisan group in Congress tried to deal with the problem. Again in 2007. In 2008, Presidential candidate Barack Obama promised comprehensive immigration reform. Instead, his administration continued the enforcement buildup and deported record numbers of people. Julieta Garibay says it's time for Republicans and Democrats to act. Garibay is undocumented herself, part of United We Dream. That's a coalition of groups which began by advocating for the DREAM Act to legalize those who were brought here as children. Now, the DREAM ACT is no longer enough. JULIETA GARIBAY: I speak on behalf of my mother and my sister who are now U.S. citizens. They don't want that. They want something comprehensive. Throwing us little pieces and thinking that, oh, let's just do it by piecemeal is not going to cut it. And I think dreamers have really seen their power. ROBBINS: Both Republicans and Democrats seem to realize that power. Republican Senator-elect Jeff Flake is a member of a bipartisan group of Senators pushing for comprehensive immigration reform. FLAKE: Both sides are motivated. We're four years out from a presidential cycle. We're two years out from another congressional cycle. So if it's going to happen, it needs to happen this year. And I think the prospects are good. ROBBINS: Flake says a new law has to do four things: increase border security even more, create a guest worker program, require employers to use something like e-verify - the online system which screens for undocumented workers. And it has to deal with the undocumented already here in a humane way. FLAKE: There is a path to citizenship. But it's an arduous path, a difficult path. ROBBINS: Fines and penalties, so as not to reward illegal entry. A path to citizenship may be a tough sell in the House, though, where anti-immigrant forces are stronger than in the Senate. But even some Christian conservatives say legalization is the right thing to do. And mainstream Republicans acknowledge Latinos won't vote for candidates they perceive as hostile to their families. Frank Sharry says this is an issue where politics and decency can meet. Sharry heads America's Voice, an immigration reform group. FRANK SHARRY: Honestly, Republicans will get a great deal of credit from Latino voters, from their own voters, from swing voters if they work with Democrats and solve a problem that causes enormous frustration among the American electorate. ROBBINS: Sharry says everyone really wants the same thing: An immigration system which allows employers to legally hire the workers they need, gives workers the protection they deserve, and a system which removes the need for people to come to this country illegally. Ted Robbins, NPR News. GREENE: And NPR News will continue digging into the immigration debate this afternoon on ALL THINGS CONSIDERED.

            "article_content": "Communities across the country reacted differently to President Obama's new immigration order.  MELISSA BLOCK, HOST: News of today's action on immigration spread quickly, especially among the young people who will be directly affected. As NPR's Richard Gonzales reports, their initial sense of jubilation and relief was tempered by a desire for more. RICHARD GONZALES, BYLINE: Pedro Ramirez is a 23-year-old graduate student of public policy in Southern California. A few years ago, he made headlines when, as student body president of Fresno State, he revealed his support for the DREAM Act, in no small part because he is undocumented. This morning, Ramirez was elated. PEDRO RAMIREZ: I'm just super glad, you know? It's a change that's been long overdue from the president. So I'm definitely very, very happy. GONZALES: Ramirez says his parents brought him to the United States from Mexico when he was about three years old. He's never returned to the land of his birth. RAMIREZ: And it also gives us an opportunity to show the American people that we're here to contribute to the country. We're here. We're ready to work. We're ready to pay taxes. GONZALES: For 24-year-old Adriana Sanchez, the word came through a flurry of texts and Facebook messages. ADRIANA SANCHEZ: I could not believe it. I was very excited not just for myself because this would definitely benefit me but excited for all my friends. GONZALES: Both Sanchez and Ramirez say they have hesitations about the president's announcement. A work permit is not the same as legal residency. And the president's action is not a permanent solution, according to Sanchez. SANCHEZ: It's just for now and under President Obama. And if it comes to the elections and Mitt Romney wins, he can just undo it. GONZALES: Still, Ramirez and Sanchez applaud today's move which they say recognizes that there are hundreds of thousands of kids who were brought here through no fault of their own. But not everyone agrees that the government has an obligation to help those young people. Bob Dane is a spokesman for the Federation for American Immigration Reform, or FAIR, which advocates immigration limits. BOB DANE: If you accept that theory and you enact the DREAM Act, the problem is we have that same moral obligation then for the next round of illegal aliens who bring their kids here and the round after that and so on and so forth. So this becomes a very flawed morality merry-go-round that just perpetuates. GONZALES: That sentiment was echoed by supporters of tougher immigration measures around the country today - among them, Dustin Chipley in Phoenix, Arizona, a state where immigration has been at the center of the political debate. DUSTIN CHIPLEY: I believe they should not stay in the U.S. if they did not properly go through the correct channels to get and obtain their citizenship here in America like everybody else has because that takes away from our rights. GONZALES: That view is also a reminder of the tension over immigration policy as the political season heats up. Richard Gonzales, NPR News. Copyright \u00a9 2012 NPR.  All rights reserved.

            "article_content": "The Republican National Convention has been designed to appeal to many different voting groups, including Hispanics. But is there a gap between the speakers on the stage and the voters in the states?  MELISSA BLOCK, HOST: From NPR News, this is ALL THINGS CONSIDERED. I'm Melissa Block. As they leave the convention in Tampa, Republican Party leaders are hoping their efforts in Florida will win over more Latino voters. Hispanic lawmakers were given high-profile speaking roles, including Florida Senator Marco Rubio, who introduced Mitt Romney last night. Recent polls suggests President Obama leads Romney 3 to 1 among Hispanics. NPR's Cheryl Corley reports from Tampa on this week's Republican efforts at outreach. CHERYL CORLEY, BYLINE: The Republican National Committee aired a tribute to Hispanics during the last night of the Republican convention. UNIDENTIFIED MAN #1: It's not a coincidence that Hispanic Americans that have reached historic milestones are also Republicans. UNIDENTIFIED MAN #2: From the first Hispanic member of Congress to the first Hispanic woman elected to Congress. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE #1: To our first Latina governor. CORLEY: In all, eight elected Hispanic leaders are featured in the video, including New Mexico Governor Susana Martinez, and Florida Senator Marco Rubio. Their message - the values of the Republican Party are in line with those of the Latino community, so Mitt Romney is the candidate Hispanics should support. (SOUNDBITE OF POLITICAL VIDEO) CORLEY: Earlier in the week at a luncheon meeting of the Hispanic Leadership Network, there was Latin music, empanada appetizers and a poster on the podium with the words: red and white (foreign language spoken) emblazoned across an elephant. Among the speakers, Nevada Governor Brian Sandoval, former Florida Governor Jeb Bush and New Mexico's Martinez. GOVERNOR SUSANA MARTINEZ: The problem is, as Republicans, we have to make sure that we don't just visit Hispanics during election time, that we make them a part of the process. CORLEY: Hispanics are typically much more loyal to the Democratic Party. Nevada's Sandoval says that's why it's part of his mission to help fill the political pipeline as he makes appointments to judgeships to commissions. GOVERNOR BRIAN SANDOVAL: I searched far and wide within the Hispanic community to find that next generation of leaders. CORLEY: The number of elected Hispanic Republicans has grown. In 2010, the Latinos who won congressional and governor's races were all Republican. Still, David Cardenas, a board member of SUNPAC, a Florida Hispanic outreach group, has this warning. DAVID CARDENAS, BOARD MEMBER, SUNPAC: There's the demographic shift taking place in America. And unless they start making inroads with the Hispanic community, it's going to be a regional party. And that's just not acceptable. CORLEY: A big obstacle though is the official Republican stance on immigration as reflected on the party platform. During the primaries, nominee Mitt Romney took an aggressive position against illegal immigration to satisfy the GOP base. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE #4: When I say immigrant, you say power. Immigrant. UNIDENTIFIED GROUP: Power. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE #4: Immigrant. UNIDENTIFIED GROUP: Power. CORLEY: A vocal group of protesters rallied at a Tampa park during the convention, Carlos Montes with the Southern California Immigration Coalition says there's a clear reason why many Latinos just aren't interested in the Republican Party. CARLOS MONTES: The Republican leadership is introducing anti-immigrant laws. And Romney's solution is the auto-deportation. He didn't even support the DREAM Act. You know, at least Obama did support the DREAM Act. CORLEY: President Obama's executive order halting deportation of some undocumented immigrants brought into the U.S. at an early age boosted his support among Latinos and preempted Senator Marco Rubio's plan to offer a GOP alternative to the DREAM Act. Former Governor Jeb Bush is a fluent Spanish speaker whose wife is Mexican-America. He's been calling for the party to sound less hostile when it discusses immigration. Still, he says while immigration may be a gateway, the economy is more important. JEB BUSH: When you can't get a job and you're uncertain about the future, it changes who you are, it changes your life. And I think the Republican platform, and more importantly, Mitt Romney, offers a lot of hope in that regard to create a climate of sustained economic growth. That's the number one issue. CORLEY: That's a message that the Romney campaign is likely to stress, especially in battleground states like Florida. Cheryl Corley, NPR News, Tampa. Copyright \u00a9 2012 NPR.

            "article_content": "There will be blood. Or at least a lot of aggressive walking and glaring, vigorous head-shaking and interruptions, all glazed with equal parts feigned respect and visceral distaste. This season's presidential debates between incumbent Democratic President Barack Obama and his challenger, Republican Mitt Romney, including Tuesday's engagement, have evolved into base-rousing spectacles of their dislike for each other. Debate watchers at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas, check out President Obama's performance Tuesday night.\n                \n                    \n                    Liz Halloran/NPR\n                    \n                \nhide caption Debate watchers at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas, check out President Obama's performance Tuesday night. It's a development that Ted Jelen, who watched the debate on the University of Nevada, Las Vegas, campus with a group of students, can't recall seeing play out so overtly in recent history. \"They simply do not like each other,\" Jelen, a UNLV political scientist, told more than 70 students who gathered to watch the debate over pizza in a tiered lecture room. \"And I think that a lot of peoples' reactions [to the debate] will be about the level of civility.\" The students? They reflected their young demographic: most Obama supporters, almost all registered to vote, largely ready to give the debate edge to the president. \"The president was more aggressive, and that's what he needed after the first debate,\" said Christian Bato, 21, a senior political science major and president of the university's debate team. Romney's stumble on answering questions about Libya, Bato said, was the \"damaging point in the debate for him.\" One student wondered if Romney strategically flubbed the Libya question so he could come on strong during Monday's final debate, dedicated to foreign policy. Said a highly skeptical Jelen: \"If that's the strategy, this guy shouldn't be a dog catcher.\" Peppered with questions from the students \u2014 about candidate strategy, the town hall format, even whether war is more likely with Iran under a Romney or Obama presidency \u2014 Jelen and a pair of his UNLV colleagues, political scientist David Fott and debate program director Jacob Thompson, came up with these perspectives: -- A student asked: How effective is it to create a bogeyman of China, a subject of the debate? \"It's red meat for both sides,\" said Thompson, in terms of the issues of outsourcing and the effect on the domestic economy, with appeal to the Democrats' union base and free-enterprise Republicans. Said Jelen: \"I think it's fairly effective,\" playing on xenophobia and providing an \"ideal target for both sides.\" -- On Romney looking more angry or exercised at times than Obama: \"People who aren't white males have a more limited range of acceptable responses,\" Jelen said. \"[Obama] learned a long time ago there's something threatening about an angry African-American male. It's something Romney can get away with, but Barack Obama cannot.\" -- A debate watcher asked: With both candidates not looking very presidential at times \u2014 looking pretty bad, in fact \u2014 how can they attract undecided voters? Voters still undecided at this point likely aren't going to the polls on Election Day, said Fott. Jelen added: The key to the discussion now is \"turnout, turnout, turnout,\" identifying supporters and getting them to the polls. The debate was about energizing the base. -- On Romney's bad Libya moment, but Obama's problem, too: \"I think Obama is clearly running out the clock on this issue,\" Jelen said. The president didn't want to talk about the events leading up to the assassination of a U.S. ambassador and three others for one of two reasons: \"Maybe it was screwed up so badly that it would be embarrassing, or he feels a conflict between his role as president and his role as candidate. As president, you always leave your adversary [in this case, Libya] a graceful way out.\" Said Thompson: Obama had a presidential moment when he pushed back on Romney's criticism of the Libya events. It led the New York debate audience to break the no-clapping rule, applauding Obama's \"pro-America, rally-around-the-flag\" assertions. -- \"What's it going to take to get a third party?\" asked William Miller, 45, who works in security for a hotel/casino. Thompson: \"An act of God.\" Though Jelen, Fott and Thompson said they think the two candidates essentially tied on substance, they gave the style edge to Obama \u2014 perhaps because his performance stood in such stark contrast to the listless debate he turned in two weeks ago. And they remained struck by the tone of the undertaking. When a challenger (Romney) cuts off the president of the United States with a curt, \"You'll get your chance,\" well, that says something about the proceeding, Jelen said. \"I'm not sure how people will react to that,\" he said, noting that there were plenty of bad manners to go around. -- When asked, \"Who won? And you can't say, 'The American public,' \" Jelen and Fott responded in unison: \"I wouldn't say that.\"",

Mitt Romney's rally in Mansfield, Ohio, on Monday began the way every political event begins. \"Please stand for the Pledge of Allegiance and our country's national anthem.\" This is always an uncomfortable moment for me. While I sat at my laptop, most of the reporters around me stood and put their hands over their hearts. This time instead of just sitting and working, I tweeted what I was feeling: @Ari_Shapiro: As a reporter I'm torn about joining in the pledge of allegiance/national anthem at rallies. I'm a rally observer, not a participant. And then: \"Yet most reporters around me stand for the anthem & pledge. I'm one of the few that doesn't. Setting myself up for accusations I guess.\" I expected a flood of vitriol. Instead, a thoughtful Twitter dialogue unfolded about what it means to be a journalist, what it means to be American, and what role the Pledge of Allegiance plays in our society. Other reporters joined in, including some sitting around me at the rally. There were strong disagreements, sometimes passionate ones. There were witty moments of irreverence. But not once did anyone accuse me of being an America-hating Communist. Here are some highlights from that dialogue: @ChrisJohnson82: I feel the same way. I've made a compromise where I stand with my hand over my heart, but remain silent. @CarolineZilk: But you're an American! ...I say, participate unless you're busy recording, taking a photo or writing something down. @Monbud: As an American, of course, it's optional to join in no matter where you are. @StevenPortnoy: I stand with my hand over my heart. Liberty and justice for all are American ideals worthy of objective endorsement. @Ari_Shapiro: But aren't lots of ideas at rallies \"American ideals worthy of objective endorsement?\" I'm not disagreeing with the pledge. @Tcmassie: As a former radio reporter, I had conversations with colleagues who did not register to vote, so as not to seem partisan. @Ari_Shapiro: Yet I vote, as an independent. @ScrollnKey: Pretty ridiculous thought. At a minimum u should participate just to celebrate that u have the freedom to choose. @Snaggleswood: The whole concept has always struck me as a bit fascist, having to stand when demanded to affirm our allegiance. @Shoshuga: Now if you were going to stand up and sing Hatikvah [Israel's national anthem], then I'd completely understand your concern. @PatOBeirne: If you are there to report, you shouldn't participate. Just don't be disrespectful. @TournezVous: Do what I did when my old job's shareholder meetings opened with prayer: bow your head & check your blackberry. @Ari_Shapiro: Every political candidate has lines I agree with. But of course I don't applaud in the stump speech. So why draw a line at the pledge? @McKayCoppins: I think the argument is that the pledge is supposed to be apart from politics\u2014not being used to elect a candidate. @GlobeSessions: I stand (so as not to disrupt by drawing attention to the sitting man) but do not recite. Blending w/o participating. @Kimu: AS a qualitative researcher, I aim for respectful non-participation & try to blend into the background. #FlyOnTheWall @Slichtor FWIW, I'd stand (same for any nat'l anthem) but history has shown that there's a fine line btwn blind patriotism & xenophobia. @DjCiskey The pledge is a unifying, non-partisan statement of values. Reciting it w/ Ds or Rs does not imply support for their platform. @TiChall If you were reporting from another country, would you stand when that country's anthem was played? @MiraOberman As a Canadian reporter I stand out of respect for anthem, pledge or prayers but don't sing/pledge/pray along as disingenuous. @BFreedInA2: Observe/participate line can be tough to draw. Humming along/tapping your foot to the music? The tunes they play can be catchy. @Ari_Shapiro: Currently tapping my foot to \"I Was Born Free...\" @Cakilpack: Not standing for the pledge is not neutral; it's a statement. This debate has a postscript. As Romney took the stage to deliver his speech, he used a rhetorical device he debuted over the weekend at a rally in Virginia. He talked about the Pledge of Allegiance and reminisced about reciting it in his fourth-grade class. Then he used each line to make a point \u2014 about unifying the country, or strengthening the military, or the role of God in public life. Which prompted this tweet: @Karinchu: @Ari_Shapiro so much for the pledge being apolitical.",

The Greek electorate will go to the polls in a re-run of the general election on June 17 after no combination of political parties were able to form a coalition government. That vote could determine whether Greece retains the Euro as its currency. Douglas Rediker is a senior fellow at the New America Foundation and a former member of the International Monetary Fund's executive board. David Gordon is head of research at Eurasia Group and former director of policy planning at the U.S. State Department. Two short years ago, if anyone had suggested that we would be considering pan-European bank regulation, cross-border deposit guarantees, joint and several Eurobonds, and the very survival of the common currency, they would have been dismissed as nothing short of crazy. But what was unthinkable then appears to be verging on the inevitable now. With last weekend's announcement of a bailout for Spanish banks and with potentially euro-shaking elections in Greece this weekend, we can now say with certainty that the staid European Union we knew for its first two decades is a thing of the past. What we're not yet sure of is just what will take its place. The complexity and breadth of the unfolding European financial crisis, with another imminent flash point seemingly around every corner, have made it particularly difficult to distinguish noise from signal and the valuable data from the spin in each day's headlines. In particular, the news focus on daily \u2014 or hourly \u2014 developments in the crisis often obscures the broader dynamics that will shape the European response over the next few months, which will in turn shape Europe itself over the next few decades. Here are 12 key trends to watch over the next few weeks for help in projecting what the new Europe will look like if it finally emerges from the mire. 1. Continuing Greek dysfunction. Pundits and analysts are waiting with bated breath for the results of Greece's elections on June 17, with many declaring it as a virtual referendum on whether the country will remain in the eurozone. But here's the truth: The possible outcomes are narrower than people think, ranging only from pretty bad to worse. If the Coalition of the Radical Left (Syriza) gets the most votes, even with the 50-vote bonus for finishing first, a fractured electorate and lack of suitable coalition partners make its prospects of forming a workable government slim. But even if an ostensibly \"pro-bailout\" combination of New Democracy and former ruling party PASOK was to squeak through with a collective majority, the effectiveness of their coalition will be severely limited and Greece's future far from clarified. These two parties are once and future rivals, and in actuality they agree on very little. Expecting that they can quickly reach consensus on the specifics of some 15 billion euros in austerity measures over the next two years is highly doubtful. Any renegotiation of the terms of Greece's bailout, moreover, will be merely a matter of spreading the pain over an additional year or two, ensuring continued political deadlock and a disgruntled electorate. Besides, the math doesn't work, and every day the country remains politically paralyzed, the costs to the country and its creditors increase. The upshot is that regardless of the election's outcome, Greece and its European partners are in for an almost unimaginable set of politically unpalatable choices. The likelihood of an election that definitively ensures that Greece remains in the eurozone is very low. 2. Spanish banks as catalyst. Some in Greece think that Athens can successfully blackmail its European partners into caving and lightening conditions on the country, lest Greece blow up and take the rest of the eurozone with it. They are probably miscalculating. Greece is, in the grand scheme of things, too small to sink the European experiment. But Spain (in part because it is too grande to fail) actually does hold some pretty daunting cards, as demonstrated by the rescue package it received over the weekend. The dynamics to watch now are how Europe's official sector lenders proceed. Although the basics of the Spanish rescue were announced, the plan is far from fleshed out, with crucial details \u2014 like where's the money coming from and on what terms will it be disbursed \u2014 remaining unresolved. When providing Spain its lifeline, policymakers are acutely conscious of the precedent that this rescue will set. This \"conditionality-lite\" Spanish program (with the Germans emphasizing the \"conditionality\" and Spanish Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy the \"lite\") might conceivably provide political cover for the Spanish government while maintaining the \"no money without strings attached\" restrictions required by the Germans. It could also, however, catalyze a more far-reaching process of reform: federalizing banking supervision and regulation within the eurozone, the possible migration of bank deposit guarantee schemes from the auspices of national governments to a pan-European one, some form of Eurobonds, and, in the end, fiscal union. Recall that the U.S. Constitutional Convention was held in part because the Articles of Confederation weren't sufficient to resolve conflicts between those states that had repaid their Revolutionary War debts and those that couldn't or wouldn't. The Articles of Confederation's drafters did not envisage a federalized entity any more than the crafters of the Maastricht Treaty foresaw a \"United States of Europe.\" The Spanish banking crisis won't trigger a formal constitutional convention, but it could have much the same effect, setting in motion a more dramatic shift in how Europe operates for decades to come. 3. Rise of extremist parties. They seem to be ascendant everywhere in Europe these days, on the right and on the left. In Greece, Syriza threatens the bailout while the neo-Nazi Golden Dawn received nearly 7 percent of the vote in May's elections. In Germany, the idiosyncratic Pirate Party has drawn a significant following. In France, Marine Le Pen's far-right National Front and Jean-Luc M\u00e9lenchon's Left Front are actually battling over the same voters, while in Italy, even corruption scandals and the resignation of its longtime leader, Umberto Bossi, hasn't stopped the virulently anti-immigrant Northern League from playing a role in Italian politics. And Geert Wilders's PVV has already caused one Dutch governent to fall and continues to play an outsized role in the Netherlands. Europe is not about to lurch dramatically left or right. But the rise of these and similar extreme parties pose two big problems \u2014 one short-term and the other long-term. First, they drastically increase the difficulty of forming stable coalitions, which in the European periphery makes imposing structural reforms and fiscal discipline hard and in the core makes agreement on comprehensive solutions even harder. The parliamentary structure of most European governments provides these smaller parties with disproportionate influence, as they are needed to create majority coalitions. Second, the extreme parties, both left and right, tend to be populist and anti-immigrant. Europe's economic woes are already decreasing its attractiveness as a destination for immigrants; xenophobia only exacerbates this dynamic. But Europe desperately needs immigration to combat its declining demography and rejuvenate economic growth. To continue reading this article, visit foreignpolicy.com.",

A presidential runoff election is scheduled to begin next Saturday and there is a lot of international interest. Soraya says the ads could be aimed at Democracy groups but they're likely aimed at foreign journalists who often meet with sources at caf\u00e9s.

Tensions between the U.S. and Egypt are rising over Cairo's investigation of aid workers, many of them American. An Egyptian Cabinet minister, Faiza Aboul Naga, recently accused the U.S. of directly funding pro-democracy groups in order to create chaos in Egypt. The Egyptian government has further escalated tensions with Washington by accusing U.S. officials of directly funding nonprofit groups to create chaos in the Arab country. The latest comments were made by an Egyptian Cabinet member to prosecutors conducting a criminal probe into the activities of 43 aid workers, many of them American. Such claims anger U.S. officials, who have threatened to hold back more than $1 billion in military aid if the crackdown on private, pro-democracy organizations doesn't end. We have no experience in democracy. We are going to have to learn from someone. I would rather learn from the Americans than the Saudi Arabians, frankly. Nora Soliman, spokeswoman for Egypt's Justice Party Yet the comments are forging a rare bond between the ruling generals and the Egyptian people, who have long been suspicious of American actions. Stories about how America is trying to undermine Egypt are rife in the country's newspapers and on TV. On a talk show on independent ONTV recently, for example, guests debated whether U.S. funding for their country comes with a sinister agenda. And a recent cartoon in the state-controlled Al-Akhbar newspaper depicted a scowling Uncle Sam aiming a small pistol labeled \"U.S. aid\" at an Egyptian official with a much larger cannon representing national dignity. Official media outlets are even more aggressive about stoking the xenophobia generated by the criminal probe into U.S.-funded pro-democracy groups in Egypt. State TV repeatedly aired comments by investigators who more or less accused the American NGO workers of being spies with maps showing how the U.S. planned to carve up Egypt. The maps one judge held up for the cameras actually showed voting districts and election dates. 'Easy And Obvious Target' Still, the Egyptian public \u2014 which has long been at odds with its interim government \u2014 has largely embraced the steady stream of allegations. Many Egyptians approve of the crackdown on American NGOs. They view them as an extension of the U.S. government that for decades backed former President Hosni Mubarak's regime. That some of the NGO employees \u2014 including the son of U.S. Secretary of Transportation Ray LaHood \u2014 sought shelter at the U.S. Embassy bolstered Egyptian suspicions that they have something to hide. \"The U.S. is such an easy and obvious target,\" says Nora Soliman, a spokeswoman for Egypt's Justice Party. \"Partly that's the fault of the Egyptian government for never wanting to give the U.S. and the U.S. aid programs credit,\" she says. \"Partly it's USAID's fault for not going out and articulating the type of support they've provided Egypt over the years. And so they are shrouded in mystery.\" Soliman is one of several Egyptians who have been very vocal in their defense of the NGOs. Candidates from her party were trained by the U.S. National Democratic Institute on how to run campaigns. \"Now granted, there were some people who were uncomfortable with some Americans coming to the party day in and day out, and doing all this training,\" Soliman says. \"But they all recognized at the same time that this was something that we needed. We have no experience in democracy. We are going to have to learn from someone. I would rather learn from the Americans than the Saudi Arabians, frankly.\" No Choice But A Trial But other people the NGOs helped train \u2014 and there were many thousands \u2014 have been more reluctant to speak out. Some are afraid of being arrested. Others, like members of the ultraconservative Islamist Nour Party, don't see it as politically prudent. Nour President Emad Abdel Ghaffour claims the people from his party who sought training from the Americans did so unofficially, adding that the criminal probe will ensure transparency and educate Egyptians on the role these groups play. He also asks whether the U.S. government would act any differently if Egyptian groups were operating in the U.S. Soliman of the Justice Party says she fears that with the public spectacle the Egyptian government created, it will have no choice but to put the Americans and others who are charged on trial. \"They may need to come out the other end having proved that they did not commit any crimes other than operating without a registration, which the government has allowed them to do for the past six years. But it won't be something that will just go away overnight,\" she says. Official Egyptian media say a date for the trial will be announced this week.",

The book focuses on the \"Born Free\" generation \u2014 those who came of age in the post-apartheid era, which began 18 years ago. As the first passage of the book highlights, this generation's story begins \"After all the excitement, after the jubilation, after the celebrations...\" A Dream Or A Lie? In a conversation with Tell Me More host Michel Martin, Matlwa she will never forget the euphoria of that historic moment. \"I was 9 or 10 years old in 1994 when the new democratic government was elected and Mandela was president, and it was such an exciting time, and there were so [many] prospects. We were the 'Rainbow Nation,' and kind of the 'golden children' of Africa.\" She remembers her parents telling her that her life would be so different from their own. But soon, Matlwa and other South Africans started to feel \"deceit and greed and corruption\" creeping into society, and she began to wonder \"whether the dream was a lie.\" It was this disappointment that led her to write Spilt Milk. The novel is centered on Mohumagadi, the successful black principal of her own \"School of Excellence,\" and her relationships with her students and with a white priest who has fallen on hard times. by Kopano Matlwa Paperback, 195 pages | Your purchase helps support NPR programming. How? Matlwa says these characters and relationships symbolize the political and personal disappointments she and other South Africans endure. \"It does represent the love lost between white and black South Africa, and the promises that we all made to each other in 1994 that none of us kept. \"We would never admit to each other that we actually need each other,\" she says, \"that we can't build this country without each other.\" A Writer And A Healer In addition to her work as a writer, Matlwa is a physician. She regularly sees South Africa's inequalities in the country's hospitals. \"It's shocking the extent of poverty in a very wealthy country ... and we can't keep using the excuse of being a young democracy for very much longer.\" She also acknowledges that the current trouble in the country's platinum and gold mines \"demonstrates how ... people are so dissatisfied, let down and disappointed. A lot of promises were made post-apartheid, and perhaps they were unrealistic, but they were made, and people are now fed up.\" Matlwa points out that medicine has always been her first love. Writing \"was really just a hobby, and I am really grateful to God that it turned out to be more than that.\" She borrows the words of another doctor who was also a famous writer to explain her twin careers. \"Anton Chekhov said it best: 'Medicine is his wife and writing his mistress.' I don't think I'll ever choose between the two,\" she explains. Beyond 'Post-Apartheid' Apartheid may have ended, but Matlwa is acutely aware that political inequality has only given way to economic inequality in contemporary South Africa. \"What's made us dig deep and ask ourselves hard questions is that this inequality has slightly worsened post-apartheid, and it's always been easy to be the victim of apartheid, to blame everything on apartheid, but now we have to ask ourselves hard questions on what we are doing as a country.\" Honesty is important to Matlwa, as she does not feel that there is enough of it in her life or in her country. \"The conversations I'd have in a room with black friends would change if a white person walked into the room. ... We live apart, we live around each other, and we've learnt to be tolerant. We've learnt words we're no longer allowed to use. ... We've got affirmative action in place, but ... I think there's a lot of anger in the country,\" she says. \"There's a lot of hurt and disappointment, and I think we just need to start talking.\"",

Read Another Opinion On Marine Le Pen And The French Election David A. Bell is the Sidney and Ruth Lapidus Professor of History at Princeton, and a contributing editor for The New Republic. To understand the state of the right wing in France, start by considering the name of Nicolas Sarkozy's political party, the country's major conservative political force. Founded a decade ago by Jacques Chirac as the Union for the Presidential Majority, it is currently known as the Union for a Popular Movement (French acronym in both cases: UMP). It descends from another party, also founded by Chirac, in 1976, called the Rally for the Republic (RPR). The RPR in turn took the place of the Union of Democrats for the Republic (UDR), which was earlier known as the Union for the Defense of the Republic (UDR), the Union of Democrats for the Fifth Republic (UDVR), and the Union for the New Republic (UNR). That party was founded at the start of the Fifth Republic, in 1958, by supporters of Charles de Gaulle, who had previously led the Rally of the French People (RPF). Everything clear? As this history might suggest, for the last half century the French right has suffered from something of an identity crisis. Now, especially if Sarkozy loses in this month's presidential runoff, the right appears on the verge of imploding altogether and reassembling itself in a different form. And the worrisome result could be that a far-right grouping achieves major party status in the country for the first time since World War II. Sarkozy himself is often referred to as a \"Gaullist.\" He shouldn't be, however, and not just because the institutional threads linking him back to de Gaulle are so ragged. Ironically, while he is the first of de Gaulle's successors not to give the party a formal facelift, he has broken far more clearly than his predecessors with de Gaulle's legacy. He is less a Gaullist than a Sarkozist. But of what does \"Sarkozysme\" consist? Therein lies the root of the current mess. Gaullism itself was always notoriously difficult to define, and Charles de Gaulle did not make things any easier by insisting that the movement should float magisterially above mere politics and ideology. Still, at the start, it was associated with a number of distinct positions. The first was a policy of national grandeur \u2014 maintaining an independent role for France as a great power and also insisting on France's leading position in the European community. The second involved dirigisme, meaning state direction \u2014 although not control or ownership \u2014 of the economy. A third was a dedication to national unity, symbolized by a powerful chief executive. And Gaullism also implied a degree of social conservatism, although distinct from the xenophobic, reactionary variety that had flourished before the war and come to power under Vichy. Sarkozy's predecessor, Chirac, sometimes chafed at various aspects of the Gaullist legacy. As leader of the opposition to Socialist President Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand, he embraced free-market positions at odds with dirigisme, and, as president himself (from 1995 to 2007), he tried to chip away at pieces of France's often-glacial system of social regulation, albeit with little success. But, in foreign policy, he followed de Gaulle's example, notably in leading the international opposition to America's invasion of Iraq. Sarkozy made a stronger break. He reintegrated France into the NATO command structure from which de Gaulle had removed it and has cooperated closely with the United States. To the extent that he has carved out an independent profile for French foreign policy, it has centered less on national glory than on human rights and humanitarian intervention, notably in Libya. In Europe, Sarkozy has tacitly accepted the position of partner to Germany \u2014 even junior partner. While he has not accomplished much more domestic reform than Chirac, he has talked loudly about the need for a \"rupture\" with French social and economic traditions. And he has placed \"national identity\" above national unity, insisting that immigrant groups assimilate to French norms and posing as the scourge of those who supposedly refuse (for instance, by wearing burqas). But, in the end, he never developed a program that brought these different initiatives into a coherent program. Sarkozysme never gelled. The financial collapse of 2008 and the subsequent unending agony of the euro zone deserve a good deal of the blame for this failure. Sarkozy has spent much of his presidency in crisis mode \u2014 something to which his manic energy is well-suited. In domestic policy, the fiscal constraints imposed by the euro's problems have given him very little room to maneuver. But he has also constantly undercut himself, thanks to his notorious difficulty sharing the spotlight and his coarsely confrontational personal style. It is no coincidence that his single best-known phrase, uttered to a protester in early 2008, is \"Casse-toi, pauv'con\" (roughly, \"Shove off, asshole\"). It is not exactly de Gaulle's \"France cannot be France without grandeur.\" In the first round of voting on April 22, Sarkozy finished second \u2014 the first time a sitting president has done so in the history of the Fifth Republic. In a bid to recover, he has made a cynical attempt to win over the first-round supporters of the National Front's Marine Le Pen (while formally opposing an actual pact with the party), despite the Front's deep hostility toward immigrant communities and the European Union, and the fact that its founder (her father, Jean-Marie) had a well-deserved reputation for racism and anti-Semitism. Le Pen is \"compatible with the Republic,\" he stated soon after the initial voting. Sarkozy's stunning acknowledgment of Le Pen's legitimacy can only help her cause: In the days after the first round, nearly two-thirds of Sarkozy voters told pollsters they favored an electoral pact with her party in the legislative elections that will follow soon after the presidential campaign. Le Pen herself clearly wants Sarkozy to lose, declaring that she will cast a blank ballot in the second round. She has called the UMP no different from the Socialists, and, indeed, her nationalist stance offers a starker alternative to the two major parties than they do to each other. Can this alternative achieve major party status? Having helped to dissolve the traditional French right while failing to replace it with a coherent or popular ideology of his own, it now appears possible that Nicolas Sarkozy's principal legacy will be the rise of Marine Le Pen.",

Some polls indicate that in the national elections May 6, Golden Dawn may surpass the 3 percent threshold needed to enter Parliament. Greeks go to the polls Sunday in a climate of intense voter anger at the politicians they blame for turning their country into an international economic pariah. Protest votes could fill Parliament with an array of new parties, and most surprising is the growing popularity of the xenophobic Golden Dawn, which espouses a neo-Nazi ideology. Costas Panagopoulos, who runs the Alco polling agency, says he has never seen such an unstable political climate in Greece. There are hardly any campaign posters from the long-dominant Socialist and New Democracy parties. Traditional outdoor rallies have been replaced by quiet, indoor gatherings with loyal supporters. The muted \u2014 apparently clandestine \u2014 campaign stems from the two big parties' plummeting credibility. \"There is a lot of anger within Greek society,\" Panagopoulos says. \"We are moving to the elections wanting to punish those we blame for today's situation.\" The Anti-Austerity, Anti-Immigrant Party The mainstream parties are paying the highest price for the country's economic decline. One of the most active new parties is the ultra-right-wing Golden Dawn.

Its latest rally was in the working-class neighborhood of Bournasi. Party supporters here are mostly young, muscular, tattooed men, heads shaven, wearing black T-shirts with the party logo \u2014 an ancient Greek motif resembling the swastika. They blame the eurozone crisis on what they call international \"banksters.\" After almost negligible support in elections three years ago, polls suggest Golden Dawn could win as much as 5 percent. Its message is simple: Dump austerity measures and kick immigrants \u2014 all of them are considered illegal \u2014 out of Greece. \"We are a Christian nation and we are Europeans. We don't need Asians, Muslim fanatics in our country, simple as that,\" says Ilias Panagiotaros, Golden Dawn spokesman, as he explains party policy: \"Seal our borders with mines, full protection from army in the borders, high penalties and fines for Greeks who rent houses to illegal immigrants, high penalties and fines for Greeks who have illegal immigrants in their jobs.\" The Golden Dawn bookshop sells Hitler's Mein Kampf and other neo-Nazi propaganda. But Panagiotaros sidesteps a question about members' use of the Nazi salute. \"You call it Nazi salute. That was how they were saluting in ancient Rome, in ancient Greece, so we consider this ancient Greek saluting,\" he says. A Prayer To 'Restore Order' In Agios Panteleimonas, a neighborhood densely populated by Asian and African immigrants, the crime rate has soared in recent years. This is Golden Dawn's recruiting ground, among the native, impoverished and frightened underclass. Party members offer themselves as bodyguards to escort the elderly to ATM machines and grocery shopping. In front of the Orthodox Church, large graffiti proclaims \"Greece for Greeks.\" Reeling from a vicious financial crisis that has cost them pensions and jobs, Greeks have been turning away in droves from the mainstream politicians they feel have let them down.

An elderly woman, who gives only her first name, Stavroula, is grateful to Golden Dawn. \"I pray to God,\" she says, that \"they will enter Parliament and restore order.\" Pollster Panagopoulos says Golden Dawn does not have deep political roots in a country that prides itself on its heroic anti-Nazi resistance in World War II. He blames the mass media for failing to inform voters about the party's real ideology. \"They do not know what these guys believe,\" says Panagopoulos. \"Those people, first of all, they do not believe to democracy. We are talking about Nazis.\" And yet, Golden Dawn's anti-immigrant campaign has put the spotlight on an issue long ignored by the political mainstream \u2014 the large inflow of immigrants, now representing 10 percent of the population. In a bid to catch up, the government this week opened the first of dozens of detention camps for illegal immigrants. Golden Dawn is one of several fringe parties \u2014 on the left and the right \u2014 taking advantage of the discredited political mainstream. Several analysts say this fragmentation will make governing difficult \u2014 a reminder of the instability and social unrest of Weimar Germany in the 1930s.",

Sarkozy will face his rival Socialist Party Francois Hollande in a final round on May 6, 2012. Read Another Opinion About The French Presidential Election Agn\u00e8s Catherine Poirier is a French journalist and writer based in London. Since the beginning of the Fifth Republic, in 1958, the French have voted nine times to elect their president. Each time, they have flocked to the polling stations. The lowest turnout was in 2002, with 71 percent participation, when extreme-right National Front leader Jean-Marie Le Pen shocked the nation by making it to the second round, before losing to Jacques Chirac in the runoff. The turnout in other European countries pales by comparison; in recent national elections it has ranged from 47 percent (Switzerland) to 65 percent (Britain) to 71 percent (Germany). This past Sunday, 80.4 percent of Frenchvoters cast their ballots. Pollsters had frightened many on the center and left who remembered 2002, when the record abstention seemed partly responsible for Le Pen's success. Despite the heavy turnout this year, his daughter Marine, leader of the National Front since December 2010, reached a record level with 17.9 percent of the vote \u2014 6.4 million, compared with 4.4 million for Jean-Marie a decade ago. While Marine was third behind Socialist leader Francois Hollande (28.6 percent), who as predicted edged out right-wing incumbent Nicolas Sarkozy (27.1 percent), her finish was no small achievement for the far right, and a scary prospect for French democracy. Le Pen's exploit is, however, not all that surprising. When I met her a few months ago, she was on a PR campaign to \"take the devil out\" of the National Front, as the media have put it (dediabolisation), rejecting for instance the \"extreme right\" epithet. Born in 1968, the twice-divorced single mother said she was in favor of abortion and gay marriage. Her economic program included the renationalization of postal services, state-funded initiatives such as a five-year reindustrialization plan and infrastructure improvements, as well as more spending to improve public services. She also appeals to young male rural voters with little education who feel despised by the Parisian elites and left out by globalization. This year's election proved to be a strange one: aggressive and digressive at the same time. Important issues such as the state of the economy, the euro crisis, unemployment, education and health were simply ignored by Sarkozy, who was too busy attacking his Socialist rival on frivolous details such as Hollande's alleged lack of experience at the government level (a weak argument, since Hollande, a lawyer by training, has been an adviser to former president Francois Mitterrand, an MP for fifteen years, a mayor and a president of one of France's twenty-two regions).\u2028Such bullying tactics clearly didn't pay off, and Hollande may be reaping the benefit of refusing to engage in personal attacks. \"I'm not interested in playground scuffle,\" he said. French voters seem grateful. Unfortunately, the campaign was polluted with absurd controversies, such as the one about halal meat. Marine Le Pen declared that 90 percent of meat consumed by Parisians was halal and that people shockingly didn't know about it. Sarkozy followed suit, while the rest of the country just watched, incredulous. One poll indicated that an overwhelming majority of the public couldn't care less about eating halal unknowingly. The matter did, however, monopolize the airwaves and editorials for two full weeks. Then French-born Salafi jihadist Mohamed Merah struck in southwestern France, killing three paratroopers, three Jewish children and one rabbi before dying in a police siege of his Toulouse apartment. Marine Le Pen, who has always talked about the \"enemy within,\" declared that French-born citizens of second- and third-generation immigrants from North Africa were being brainwashed by foreign radical imams. After the attack Sarkozy supervised roundups in extremist Islamist circles, and security was suddenly back on the table. However, polls suggested that it was a priority for only 8 percent of the electorate. What the French wanted to hear about was still the economy, education and health. Rising steadily in the polls throughout the campaign had been Jean-Luc Melenchon, nicknamed the French left's pit bull by British commentators. To the left of Hollande's Socialists, Melenchon's Left Front includes the Communists and other small radical left parties. A formidable orator who somehow comes off as both pugnacious and genial, Melenchon was polling at only around 5 percent at the beginning of the campaign, but he quickly climbed to 15 percent. Attracting 100,000 people in rallies on the streets of Paris, as well as big crowds on Marseille beaches, in Toulouse and in other cities, Melenchon became the star of the campaign. Melenchon said he had one mission in life: to reclaim the working-class vote from Le Pen's National Front. But he ended up with only 11.1 percent, and what would have seemed a triumph a few weeks earlier suddenly looked like failure. Alas, 2.4 million more voters opted for Le Pen, making her by far the strongest representative of the working class. Perhaps Melenchon's constant references to the French Revolution were missed on young uneducated French men, many of whom seemed to prefer Marine's coarser language about \"the rotten Parisian elites who always short-change us.\" The centrist Francois Bayrou, a perennially popular politician, came in a disappointing fifth place this time, with barely 10 percent of the vote. Even though Le Pen didn't make it to the second round, she will weigh heavily on the May 6 runoff and, of course, on the parliamentary elections on June 10 and 17. First of all, her voters hold Sarkozy's fate in their hands. He needs almost all of them to defeat Hollande, but will they switch to him? Nothing is less certain. Louis Aliot, the National Front's vice president and Le Pen's partner, has already declared that he won't vote for either Sarkozy or Hollande. While the two front-runners are busy trying to appeal to Le Pen's voters \u2014 especially the younger ones, who are not seen as xenophobic but rather as worried about the economic crisis \u2014 pollsters estimate that perhaps half will turn to Sarkozy, a quarter to Hollande and a quarter will abstain. Such a scenario would herald the end of Sarkozy's presidency. As Le Pen declared on Sunday evening, \"I'm simply waiting for Sarkozy and his party to implode.\" In the June elections Le Pen will attempt to break up the right in the National Assembly, and thus end the hegemony of Sarkozy's UMP party (Union for a Popular Movement). She dreams of three equal forces: the UMP, Francois Bayrou's center and the National Front, with her playing referee, a novel and unsettling prospect. If Sarkozy is defeated on May 6 \u2014 especially if by a large majority, as many are predicting \u2014 it will be as much an indictment of his policies and personality as a victory for the genial and serious Hollande. Sarkozy has antagonized and divided France for five years, feeding voter frustration and throwing many into Marine Le Pen's open arms. Hollande, if he is elected president, will inherit a very precarious situation.",

Current President Nicolas Sarkozy is fighting for his life in a close race against a man who has never held national office and is virtually unknown outside of France. Eleanor Beardsley profiles socialist candidate Francois Hollande.  SCOTT SIMON, HOST: French voters go to the polls three weeks from today to cast ballots in the first round of their presidential election. Current president Nicolas Sarkozy is fighting for his life in a close race against a man who has never held national office, and is virtually unknown outside of France. NPR's Eleanor Beardsley sends this profile of socialist candidate Francois Hollande. (SOUNDBITE OF APPLAUSE) ELEANOR BEARDSLEY, BYLINE: At the Cirque d'Hiver, a small, 19th century circus ring in the center of Paris, the starring act on this March evening is Francois Hollande. FRANCOIS HOLLANDE: (French spoken) BEARDSLEY: As the unassuming, bespectacled presidential candidate takes center ring, the crowd's enthusiasm seems almost out of synch with his low-key manner. Yet the man who calls himself Mr. Normal, is exactly what many people are looking for after five years of hyperactive drama under President Nicolas Sarkozy, says political analyst Andre Bercoff. ANDRE BERCOFF: Not because they are enthusiastic about Hollande - not on love or enthusiasm or his charisma or all this. It is really, if he can get rid of Sarkozy for us, that could be fine. BEARDSLEY: Attending the rally was Ben Roques, who says he works as an actor. Roques says Hollande would be a breath of fresh air after Sarkozy and all his anti-immigrant talk. BEN ROQUES: I was really ashamed, ashamed about France these last five years with such a xenophobic president. And I think Francois Hollande will be much better. (SOUNDBITE OF A CAMPAIGN FILM) BEARDSLEY: A campaign film portrays Hollande as a unifier and consensus builder from small town France. Hollande is a congressman from a rural district. His biggest job has been to serve as Socialist Party secretary. Last fall, Hollande won the nomination of his party, which has not held the French presidency since Francois Mitterrand was elected in 1981. During the last election in 2007, the Socialists chose Segolene Royale, Hollande's decades-long partner and the mother of his four children. She lost to Sarkozy and the couple has since split up. The boring, but solid Hollande might have been overlooked for a flashier candidate again this time around. Former IMF head Dominique Strauss-Kahn was considered the runaway favorite to beat Sarkozy. But Strauss-Kahn imploded in a series of sex scandals, leaving the way clear for Hollande. Franz Olivier Giesbert, editor of weekly newsmagazine Le Point, describes Strauss-Kahn as decadent, and says he always believed Hollande was a better candidate. FRANZ OLIVIER GIESBERT: He's very brilliant - very, very smart. He knows really very well his subjects, especially on economy. And very witty. He's one of the wittiest politicians I ever met - very fast. Very fast when he talks, not when he takes decision. He knows how to give time to time as Francois Mitterrand used to say. BEARDSLEY: Mitterrand is Hollande's mentor and the candidate evokes him often on the campaign trail. Hollande is even said to mimic Mitterrand's gestures. And like Mitterrand, Hollande engages in anti-capitalist rhetoric. HOLLANDE: (Foreign language spoken) BEARDSLEY: He has no face and no name, but the world of big finance is my real adversary, he said recently. Hollande is calling for higher taxes on banks, big firms and the rich to help cut the public deficit. He wants to pump funds into education and job creation, and says he'll renegotiate a European austerity treaty if elected. His talk has so worried Europe's financiers that Hollande recently travelled to London where he told employees in the financial district: You have nothing to fear. Sarkozy's camp accused Hollande of being two-faced, Margaret Thatcher in London and Francois Mitterrand in Paris. (SOUNDBITE OF A POLITICAL RALLY) BEARDSLEY: But observers say Hollande's anti-capitalist talk is clearly aimed at placating the far-left of his party. The radical Socialists came out in force at a recent Paris rally to support their candidate, Jean Luc Melenchon, who has been gaining in the polls. Editor Giesbert says Hollande has no choice but to woo this crowd. GIESBERT: There is a strong left in France. And the left of the party doesn't like Francois Hollande. There are many fights. So he wants to talk to this electorate. He wants to be supported by his left. So that's why he gives promises that I'm not sure he's going to follow through. BEARDSLEY: Some observers say Hollande is a pragmatic realist who knows France can not go on a spending spree. They say once Hollande is elected, he'll use his combination of smarts and consensus building skills to bring about the reforms France needs only slowly and gently.

            "article_content": "Republican presidential candidates Rick Santorum, Mitt Romney, and Newt Gingrich  participate in a debate on Jan. 16, 2012 in Myrtle Beach, South Carolina. The candidates' super PACs have unleashed ads against each other.\n                \n                    \n                    Joe Raedie/Getty Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption Republican presidential candidates Rick Santorum, Mitt Romney, and Newt Gingrich  participate in a debate on Jan. 16, 2012 in Myrtle Beach, South Carolina. The candidates' super PACs have unleashed ads against each other. Ed Kilgore is a Special Correspondent for The New Republic. Sorting out cause and effect in political campaigns is not always simple. Some people look at John McCain's nomination in 2008 and Mitt Romney's success in Iowa and New Hampshire this year and see highly fortuitous demolition derbies. Others look at the same facts and intone \"next-in-line\" or some similar Iron Law of presidential politics. So it's not surprising there might be serious differences of opinion over the latest unlikely set of events in the 2012 contest: Newt Gingrich's attacks on Romney's record at Bain Capital, and the apparent revival of the former Speaker's campaign in South Carolina. The basic data points are all reasonably clear: immediately after finishing fourth in New Hampshire, Gingrich (with Rick Perry as his wing-man) starts blasting Romney as a job-killing corporate predator. His SuperPAC, Winning Our Future, infused with a fresh $5 million by casino mogul Sheldon Adelson, put out a lurid trailer for a \"film\" about Bain Capital's alleged atrocities against companies and workers with the evocative title: \"When Mitt Romney Came To Town.\" (The documentary is also dubbed in accompanying publicity material as \"King of Bain.\") Said film, a 28-minute masterpiece of invective, was put up on the web, to the glee of Democrats astonished at this gift to their own general-election talking points. The conservative commentariat came down on Newt (and to a lesser extent Perry) like a ton of bricks, accusing him of treason against capitalism. Gingrich danced this way and that, at first seeming to regret this line of attack, then continuing it. Winning Our Future began airing 30 and 60-second snippets from its film in South   Carolina, as part of a $3.4 million ad buy. Fact-checkers tore into the film, accusing it of various slurs against both Romney's role in Bain and the specific accusations against the company's practices. What came next was surprising: New polls came out showing Gingrich with rising support in South Carolina, at the expense of both Romney and Iowa co-winner Rick Santorum. Then Gingrich suddenly announced he was asking his SuperPAC to edit or take down the film, and perhaps its ads, too, if they also prove to be inaccurate. (He also demanded that Mitt rein in his SuperPAC, which did untold damage to Newt in Iowa and is now heavily buying up ad time in South Carolina.) Winning Our Future dragged its feet on complying, saying it won't act until Romney enumerates any inaccuracies and also answers some new questions about his relationship with Bain. As of this writing, the film is still up on the internet, and Winning Our Future has moved on to a new round of attack ads against Romney in South Carolina, focusing on his own dubious claims of job creation at Bain, and his \"moderate\" record as governor of Massachusetts. One key imponderable is the extent to which actual South Carolina Republican primary voters have absorbed the back-and-forth maneuverings. Few have probably seen the full Winning Our Future film, which is the source of the most controversial accusations against Romney and Bain, and of the elite conservative backlash against Gingrich for countenancing it. And it's not clear those who do see or hear about it will fully identify with its Michael Moore-ish message (though it's not entirely the sort of thing a lefty would produce; it's loaded with xenophobic flourishes in addition to \"corporate-raider\" bashing). Complicating the picture even more is that the most likely receptive audience for this message of anger at Wall Street predators are downscale white voters in the Piedmont and Pee Dee regions of South Carolina, who also harbor lots of Christian Right/Tea Party sentiments \u2014 that is to say, anti-Romney tendencies. The crosscurrents in South Carolina are probably best illustrated by oracular comments from the king of Palmetto State conservatism, Senator Jim DeMint. DeMint (who has said he is not endorsing a candidate) joined the chorus of criticism of Gingrich for his supposed anti-free-enterprise message, and predicted a Romney win in his state. But within the same 24-hour span, he also, in the course of saying nice things about Ron Paul, suggested there is no room for \"moderates\" in today's GOP. Need still another complication for figuring out what's going on? A group of Christian Right leaders convened in Texas by Family Research Council chief Tony Perkins has just endorsed Rick Santorum, after a multi-ballot vote in which Gingrich seems to have done initially well, while Perry \u2014 who hosted many of the same worthies in a highly publicized event over the summer \u2014 was largely dismissed as yesterday's news. So did Newt's mini-surge in the polls result from his attacks on Romney, the SuperPAC's vicious artistry, or perhaps just an inevitable consolidation of right-wing opposition to Romney's nomination? And of equal importance, how much of the eventual outcome of the primary will be attributed to this saga? There remains another week of campaigning, and a televised debate. But regardless of the result, the attacks on Romney could play a major role, whether it's via damage done to Romney or to the growing anger of conservative opinion-leaders against Gingrich for raising this toxic issue in the first place. So, important lessons will be learned from this strange phase of this strange nomination contest. But which ones?",
